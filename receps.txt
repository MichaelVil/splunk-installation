OG = 1.049 FG = 1.012 IBU = 15 SRM = 5 ABV = 4.8%

Ingredients
5 lbs. 2 oz. (2.3 kg) Belgian Pilsner malt (2 °L)
2.25 lbs. (1.0 kg) wheat malt
2.25 lbs. (1.0 kg) flaked wheat
0.50 lbs. (0.23 kg) flaked oats
0.50 lbs. (0.23 kg) rice hulls
1.8 AAU Saaz Hops (60 min.) (0.50 oz./14 g of 3.6% alpha acids)
3.6 AAU Saaz Hops (15 min.) (1.0 oz./28 g of 3.6% alpha acids)
1 tsp Irish moss or 1 Whirlfloc tablet (15 min.)
0.50 oz (14 g) bitter orange peel (10 min.)
0.25 oz. (7.1 g) ground coriander seed (10 min.)
White Labs WLP400 (Belgian Wit Ale) or Wyeast 3944 (Belgian Witbier) yeast
1 cup (200 g) priming sugar

Step by Step
Mill the grains with the exception of the rice hulls, flaked wheat and the flaked oats. Dough in using 3.5 gallons (13 L) of water with a target mash holding temperature of 152 °F (67 °C). Hold the mash temperature for approximately 60 minutes or until the conversion is complete. Raise the temperature of the mash to 168 °F (76 °C) and begin sparging with 170 °F (77 °C) water until you collect 6 gallons (23 L) of wort in the kettle. The total wort boiling time for this recipe is 60 minutes. At the onset of a full rolling boil, add your first scheduled hop addition. When there are 15 minutes remaining in the boil, add the second hop addition along with your Irish moss or Whirlfloc tablet to help with precipitation of the hot break. At 10 minutes remaining, add both the ground coriander seed and the bitter orange peel.

Cool the wort to 70 °F (21 °C), transfer to your fermentation vessel and aerate the wort adequately. Add the contents of your yeast starter to the chilled wort. Ferment around 70 °F (21 °C) until the final gravity is reached, which should be in 5 to 7 days. Rack to a secondary vessel and allow the beer to mature another 5 to 7 days around the same temperature. Your beer is now ready to rack into a keg or bottles along with the priming sugar.

(5 gallons/19 L, extract with grains)
OG = 1.049 FG = 1.012 IBU = 15 SRM = 8 ABV = 4.8%

Ingredients
2.75 lbs. (1.25 kg) wheat liquid malt extract
2.75 lbs. (1.25 kg) Pilsner liquid malt extract
1.75 lbs. (0.79 kg) Belgian Pilsner malt (2 °L)
0.25 lbs. (0.11 kg) flaked wheat
0.25 lbs. (0.11 kg) flaked oats
1.8 AAU Saaz Hops (60 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g of 3.6% alpha acids)
3.6 AAU Saaz Hops (15 min.) (1.0 oz./28 g of 3.6% alpha acids)
1 tsp. Irish moss or 1 Whirlfloc tablet (15 min.)
0.50 oz. (14 g) bitter orange peel (10 min.)
0.25 oz. (7.1 g) ground coriander seed (10 min.)
White Labs WLP400 (Belgian Wit Ale) or Wyeast 3944 (Belgian Witbier) yeast
1 cup (200 g) priming sugar

Step by Step
Mill the Belgian Pilsner malt, but be sure not to mill the flaked wheat or the flaked oats. Place them all into a grain bag and steep using 3 quarts (2.8 L) of 152 °F (67 °C) water for 45 minutes. Rinse the grain bag with an additional 2 quarts (1.9 L) of water and allow it to drip into the kettle for about 15 minutes. Add enough water for a pre-boil volume of 6 gallons (23 L). Stir in both malt extracts and begin the boil.
The total wort boiling time for this recipe is 60 minutes. At the onset of a full rolling boil, add your first scheduled hop addition. When there are 15 minutes remaining in the boil, add the second hop addition along with your Irish moss or Whirlfloc tablet to help with precipitation of the hot break. At 10 minutes remaining, add both the ground coriander seed and the bitter orange peel. [If you can’t manage a 60-minute, 6-gallon (23-L) boil, try to boil at least 3.5 gallons (13.0 L) for 60 minutes and withhold half of the malt extract until late in the boil.

Cool the wort to 70 °F (21 °C), transfer to your fermentation vessel and aerate the wort adequately. Add the contents of your yeast starter to the chilled wort. Ferment around 70 °F (21 °C) until the final gravity is reached, which should be in 5 to 7 days. Follow the remaining instructions for the all-grain recipe.

Anderson Valley describes this summer sipper as a slightly sweet, malty session beer with a creamy mouthfeel and clean finish.

Ingredients
8 lbs. 14 oz. (4 kg) 2-row pale malt
13 oz. (0.38 kg) crystal malt (40 °L)
11 oz. (0.30 kg) crystal malt (80 °L)
2.3 AAU Cascade hops (0 min.) (0.45 oz./13 g of 5% alpha acids)
1-2 vanilla beans (post-fermentation)
Wyeast 2112 (California Lager) or White Labs WLP810 (San Francisco Lager) yeast
2/3 cup (130 g) dextrose (if priming)

Step by Step
Mash the grains at 150 °F (66 °C). Vorlaf until your runnings are clear, sparge, and then boil the wort for 60 minutes. Add the hops at flameout, stir the wort to create a whirlpool, and let them steep in the whirlpool for at least 20 minutes. After the whirlpool, chill the wort to 65 °F (18 °C), aerate well, and pitch the yeast. Ferment at 65 °F (18 °C). Split the vanilla bean lengthwise then chop. Place in a small bowl and add just enough vodka to cover. Soak for 7 days. When the beer reaches final gravity, add the vanilla bean tincture and wait another 7 days. Then bottle or keg as normal.

Extract with Grains Option
Scale the 2-row pale malt down to 3 oz. (85 g), and add 2 lbs. (0.91 kg) light dried malt extract and 4 lbs. (1.8 kg) light liquid malt extract (late addition). Place crushed grains in a steeping bag and submerge in 3 qts. (2.8 L) of water at 161 °F (72 °C). Steep at 150 °F (66 °C) for 45 minutes. Begin heating 2 gallons (7.6 L) of water in your brew pot. After steep, lift grain bag into colander placed over brew pot to collect the liquid. Stir in the dried malt extract and bring to a boil. Boil for 60 minutes. Stir in liquid malt extract with 20 minutes left in the boil. Add the hops at the end of the boil, stir the wort to create a whirlpool, and let them steep for at least 20 minutes. Chill the wort, transfer to fermenter and top up with cool water to reach to 5 gallons (19 L). Follow the remainder of the all-grain recipe.

"This is a recipe for Devil’s Heart of Gold, a whiskey barrel–aged wheat wine. The base beer, Heart of Gold, won a silver medal at the Great American Beer Festival in 2012." – Phil Wymore, Perennial Artisan Ales

Ingredients
8.5 lb. (3.9 kg) 2-row pale malt
8.5 lb. (3.9 kg) wheat malt
3.0 lb. (1.4 kg) golden liquid malt extract
18.9 AAU Magnum hops (60 min.) (1.5 oz./43 g at 12.6% alpha acids)
0.83 oz. (24 g) Columbus hops (0 min.)
Whiskey-soaked oak chips or cubes
2.5 g Yeastex (or equivalent yeast nutrient) (15 min.)
1 Whirlfloc tablet (or similar kettle fining) (5 min.)
Wyeast 1056 (American Ale), White Labs WLP001 (California Ale), or Fermentis Safale US-05 yeast (2-qt./~2 L yeast starter)
3/4 cup (150 g) dextrose (if priming)

Step by Step
Mash the 2-row pale and wheat malts at 150°F (66°C) in about 6.25 gallons (24 L) of water for 45 minutes. Mash out, vorlauf, and then sparge at 170°F (77°C) to collect 6.5 gallons (25 L) of wort. Boil for 60 minutes, adding the hops, Yeastex, and Whirlfloc at the times indicated in the ingredients list. Rack the wort to your primary fermenter, allowing for plenty of head space. Pitch the yeast and ferment at 68°F (20°C) for 3 weeks. For wood aging, Perennial Brewmaster Phil Wymore states, "You can use whiskey-soaked oak chips or cubes to your preference and aging time. Purge the head space in the bucket or carboy with CO2 in between samplings. If you can get your hands on a freshly dumped whiskey barrel from a distillery, brew this recipe scaled-up and split over several brew sessions or among brewing companions, enough to fill the barrel. Purge the head space in the barrel with CO2 if there is any elapsed time between racking batches to the barrel. Despite your temptations, let the beer age for at least 10 to 12 months and don’t rack it out until you feel it tastes right." When oak aging is finished, force carbonate the beer in kegs or bottles with priming sugar and fresh pitched yeast such as Lallemand’s CBC-1.

Extract with Grains Option
Substitute the 2-row pale malt and the wheat malt with 3 pounds (1.4 kg) golden liquid malt extract and 9 pounds (4.1 kg) wheat dried malt extract. Heat 6.5 gallons (25 L) of water in your brewpot to a boil. Add the liquid and dried malt extract and stir until all of the extract has dissolved. Boil the wort for 60 minutes, adding the hops at times indicated in the ingredients list. Follow the remaining portion of the all-grain recipe.

Ingredients
2.25 lbs. (1 kg) Gambrinus Pilsner malt
2.25 lbs. (1 kg) Weyermann Pilsner malt
3.75 lbs. (1.7 kg) wheat malt
1.5 lbs. (0.7 kg) dark wheat malt (7 °L)
0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) Weyermann Carared® malt (20 °L)
0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) rice hulls
2.5 AAU Perle hops (60 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 5% alpha acids)

Wyeast 3638 (Bavarian Weizen) or White Labs WLP531 (Bavarian Weizen) or Safbrew WB-06 yeast
7⁄8 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
This recipe calls for a step mash. Mill the grains, then mix (along with rice hulls) with 3.2 gallons (12.1 L) of 120 °F (49 °C) strike water, for an initial mash temp of 110 °F (43 °C); hold for 15 minutes. Ramp mash up to 142 °F (61 °C); hold for 30 minutes. Ramp to 155 °F (68 °C); hold for 30 minutes. Mash out at 168 °F (76 °C). If you prefer a single infusion mash, then mix with 3.2 gallons (12.1 L) of 162 °F (73 °C) strike water to reach a mash temperature of 152 °F (67 °C). Hold this temperature for 60 minutes.

Vorlauf until your runnings are clear, and lauter. Sparge the grains with 4 gallons (15.3 L) and top up as necessary to obtain 6 gallons (23 L) of wort. Boil for 70 minutes, adding hops according to the ingredient list and a kettle clarifier if desired. After the boil and whirlpool, chill the wort to slightly below fermentation temperature, about 63 °F (17 °C). Pitch yeast.

Ferment at 64 °F (18 °C), either until the completion of primary fermentation or until gravity reaches 1.020, then apply bung/spund if possible, but only with a proper spunding valve. If fermenting until the beer completes fermentation, reduce temperature to 32 °F (0 °C), then bottle or keg the beer and carbonate to approximately 2.7 volumes.

Tips for Success:
Deliberately underpitching is a pretty radical step, and I don’t usually recommend it. However, you should definitely be safe with simply dropping the aeration/oxygen step, pre-pitch (and what the heck, if you want to be faithful to the original, go ahead and cut your yeast pitch by about 10 percent). Otherwise, simply be sure to use good, fresh malts and consider a step mash for this beer even if you don’t do so for any others – it will greatly aid in phenol production. Finally, one note if you’re going to give spunding a try: It’ll be the easiest bottle conditioning you’ll ever do, but be very sure of your math, or you could end up with bottle bombs!
Thanks again to Josh and Bryan for their timely and expert help on this beer.

Piatz’s Basic Lambic
Piatz’s Basic Lambic
(5 gallons/19 L, extract only)
OG = 1.056 FG = 1.016 or lower IBU = 0 SRM = 3 ABV = 5.2+%

Ingredients
3.0 lbs. (1.4 kg) light dried malt extract
3.0 lbs. (1.4 kg) wheat dried malt extract
0.25 lbs. (0.11 kg) malto-dextrin powder
3 oz. (85 g) well-aged hops
Wyeast 3278 (Lambic Blend) or mixture of commercial cultures and microbes cultured from commercial lambics

Step by Step
The malto-dextrin is to be sure there are a few complex sugars left for the extra organisms to eat after the brewers yeast gets finished with its work. I use the dried extract since lambic is a very light colored beer and most liquid extracts seem to be too dark for the style. The wheat extract is a poor man’s approximation of the unmalted wheat used in the commercial lambic breweries. I don’t know of an extract equivalent of unmalted wheat.

The water is brought to a boil and the extract and malto-dextrin are added. After re-establishing the boil, the hops are added and the boil is held for 90 to 120 minutes. I don’t bother with Irish moss in a lambic, but you can use it if you feel the need. I run the hot wort directly from the kettle to the plastic bucket without chilling and will leave the wort in the bucket for a day or so with the lid partially open to the kitchen air, which is typically full of enteric
bacteria. This exposure will allow the enteric bacteria present in the air to add their components to the beer.

After the exposure to the air, I place the lid on the bucket and wait a few days before I pitch a normal brewers yeast. The variety doesn’t matter very much; I either use yeast from a prior "normal" beer or a packet of dried yeast. By this time the beer is starting to get a little "funky" and the surface may look a little oily. At this point I also add the treated piece of oak back into the bucket — do not run the hot wort onto it or you will be sanitizing it.

The brewers yeast will rapidly change the pH and generate ethanol, both of which will help kill off the enteric bacteria but their byproducts will still be there. After a few weeks I add the other organisms, the Brettanomyces, Pediococcus, Lactobacillus and the dregs from commercial lambics and prior batches of homebrewed lambic.

Pickle Beer
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.046 FG = 1.010 IBU = 5 SRM = 4 ABV = 4.7%

Ingredients
4.75 lbs. (2.2 kg) 2-row pale malt
4.75 lbs. (2.2 kg) white wheat malt
2 large cucumbers (chopped)
1/4 cup (120 mL) pickle brine
3.75 AAU Sterling hops (10 min.)(0.5 oz./14 g at 7.5% alpha acids)
4 Swanson probiotic capsules
SafAle US-05 yeast (or similar clean fermenting yeast strain)
¾ cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Mash at 148 °F (64 °C) for 60 minutes, then raise mash temperature up to 170 °F (77 °C) and hold for 15 minutes. Sparge with enough water to collect 5 gallons (19 L) in a Corny keg. Once cool enough, pitch the Lactobacillus and purge the keg with carbon dioxide. Hold temperature in the 90s °F (mid 30s °C) for 3 days. Boil wort 15 minutes, adding the hops with 10 minutes remaining. Ferment at 68 °F (20 °C) with ale yeast. After fermentation is complete add chopped cucumbers. After 5 days, add the pickle brine. Transfer to keg and carbonate to 2.5 v/v or bottle and prime.

Extract only option:
Replace the grains with 5 lbs. (2.3 kg) wheat dried malt extract. Begin by heating 5 gallons of water to 170 °F (77 °C) then stir in the extract. Hold at this temperature for 15 minutes. You are then ready to chill, transfer to the Corny keg, and pitch the Lactobacillus. Follow all-grain recipe for remaining instructions.

If you are on the hunt for a beer that is nice and refreshing on a hot day, I’ve got a recipe for you! We had tons of cucumbers growing in the garden and we were making a lot of pickles. I stumbled on a recipe for salt pickles: https://spicetrekkers.com/recipes/salt-pickles. Since there was no vinegar involved I decided to use that to salt a Gose.

The Gose was just 50% Pilsner malt and 50% white wheat. I then kettle-soured the wort with some Swanson’s probiotic capsules in a keg in a hot shed (August heat) for 3 days. I fermented with SafAle US-05 and when that finished I cut up two cucumbers from the garden and added them to the 5 gallons (19 L) in the fermenter. Finally I added about 1/4 cup (120 mL) of the pickle brine. This summer I will be doing it again but will add more brine and also some fresh dill to really make it much more pickle-like.

Plzensky Prazdroj's Pilsner Urquell clone
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.048 FG = 1.015 IBU = 40 SRM = 4 ABV = 4.4%

Brewed in Plzen, Czech Republic, Pilsner Urquell is the original Pilsner beer. Brew this clone with soft water.

Ingredients
8 lbs. (3.6 kg) continental Pilsner malt
1 lb. (0.45 kg) Vienna malt
0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) Munich malt (6 °L)
0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) Carafoam® malt
5.2 AAU Saaz hops (80 min.) (1.3 oz./38 g at 4% alpha acids)
3.2 AAU Saaz hops (45 min.) (0.8 oz./23 g at 4% alpha acids)
3 AAU Saaz hops (25 min.) (0.75 oz./21 g at 4% alpha acids)
1 tsp. Irish moss
Wyeast 2001 (Pilsner Urquell H-strain) or White Labs WLP800 (Pilsner Lager) yeast (3 qt./3 L starter)
3/4 cup (150 g) dextrose (if priming)

Step by Step
The traditional Pilsner Urquell utilizes an undermodified Pilsner malt that is malted by the brewery. The mash is subsequently triple decocted to help break down the protein matrix that is still present in the undermodified malts. For three reasons we have decided to change up the classic recipe. First homebrewers don’t often have access to undermodified Pilsner malts these days. Second, a triple decoction means a long and rigorous brew day for the brewer. Finally adding in a protein rest could be detrimental to the beer’s body and head retention. So we’ve simplified the mash procedure and added some malts to help adjust the color and add a slight toasted character that the triple decoction should otherwise add to the beer’s profile. Mash grains with 15 qts. (14.2 L) soft water at 142 °F (61 °C) and hold for 30 minutes. Perform a decoction, pull 1/3 thick portion of the mash (~1.5 gallons/5.7 L) and bringing to a boil. Boil for 15 minutes being sure not to scorch the grain mix. Stir the decocted portion back into the main mash. The main mash should now settle at 155 °F (68 °C). Hold for a 30 minute rest. Mash out, vorlauf, and then sparge at 170 °F (77 °C) to collect enough wort to result in 5 gallons (19 L) after a 90-minute boil. Boil 90 minutes, adding hops at times indicated. Cool, aerate, and pitch yeast. Ferment at 50 °F (10 °C) until signs of fermentation have slowed considerably. Some diacetyl is noted in Pilsner Urqell, but if there is a strong diacetyl presence at this point, 2-4 days at 65 °F (18 °C) is advised. Rack to secondary and lager for 4-6 weeks at 40 °F (4 °C). After lagering is complete, bottle or keg as usual.

Partial mash option:
Replace grains in all-grain recipe with 1.4 lb. (0.64 kg) Pilsen dried malt extract, 3.3 lbs. (1.5 kg) Pilsen light liquid malt extract, 1.75 lbs. (0.79 kg) Pilsner malt, 0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) Vienna malt, 0.25 lb. Munich malt (10 °L), and 0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) Carapils malt. In a large soup pot, heat 4.5 quarts (4.3 L) of water to 169 °F (76 °C). Add crushed grains to grain bag. Submerge bag and let grains steep around 158 °F (70 °C) for 45 minutes. While grains steep, begin heating 2.1 gallons (7.8 L) of water in your brewpot. When steep is over, remove 1.5 qts. (1.4 L) of water from brewpot and add to the "grain tea" in steeping pot. Place colander over brewpot and place steeping bag in it. Pour grain tea (with water added) through grain bag. This will strain out any solid bits of grain and rinse some sugar from the grains. Heat liquid in brewpot to a boil, then stir in dried malt extract. Boil 60 minutes, adding liquid malt extract with 15 minutes remaining and hops as indicated. Cool and top off to 5 gallons (19 L). Follow the remaining portion of the all-grain recipe.

Piwo Grodziskie
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.037 FG = 1.007 IBU = 30 SRM = 4 ABV = 3.9%

Ingredients
7 lbs. (3.2 kg) oak-smoked wheat malt
0.6 lb. (0.27 kg) German pale ale malt
14 oz. (0.4 kg) rice hulls
5.6 AAU Saaz hops (60 min.) (1.6 oz./45 g at 3.5% alpha acids)
7 AAU Saaz hops (0 min.) (2 oz./58 g at 3.5% alpha acids)
Wyeast 1007 (German Ale), White Labs WLP029 (German/Kölsch Ale), or SafAle K-97
¾ cup table sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
This recipe uses reverse osmosis (RO) water adjusted to 71 ppm Ca2+, 33 ppm Mg2+, 1 ppm Na+, 124 ppm Cl-, 202 ppm SO42-, assumed 5 ppm hardness as CaCO3, 1 mL 88% lactic acid or equivalent acidulated malt. The high magnesium level is characteristic of the water of Grodzisk, Poland.

Dough-in and rest using 4.5 gallons (17 L) of treated liquor for an hour at 150 °F (66 °C). Alternately, a step mash using the following steps may be used: 100 °F (38 °C), 30 min.; 125 °F (52 °C), 45 min.; 145 °F (63 °C), 45 min.; 158 °F (70 °C), 30 min.; 170 °F (77 °C), 10 min. mash-out. If desired, use a decoction to raise the mash temperature to the final step. Drain into kettle. Batch or fly sparge with 4-gallons (15-L) water at 170 °F (77 °C), run off to collect 6.75 gallons (26 L) of wort.

Boil the wort for 90 minutes assuming 1 gallon-per-hour (3.8 Liter-per-hour) boil-off rate, adding hops per the schedule. At 10 minutes, add 1 whirlfloc tab and 2 g yeast nutrient (optional). After the boil, give the wort a long stir to create a whirlpool and let settle for 20 minutes.

Chill to 60 °F (16 °C). If not using dry yeast, oxygenate or aerate. Pitch an adequate quantity of yeast. Ferment at 65 °F (18 °C) for three days or until half of fermentation is complete, then allow temperature to rise to a maximum of 68 °F (20 °C). After a short conditioning, prime and bottle or keg to 3.5 volumes CO2.

Notes:
Though possibly difficult to find, if available substitute Marynka hops for bittering and Lublin hops for flavor. Unfortunately there is no extract substitute for smoked malts available in most places.

Pizza Ale
Pizza Ale
(5 gallons/19 L, partial mash)
OG = 1.056 FG = 1.0.13 IBU = 17 SRM = 14 ABV = 5.8%

Ingredients:
2 lbs. (0.91 kg) two-row pale malt
1 lb. (0.45 kg) amber malt (or brown malt)
1 lb. (0.45 kg) medium crystal malt (40 to 60° L)
4.5 lbs. (2 kg) amber dried malt extract
5 AAU Willamette hops (60 min.) (1 oz./28 g at 5% alpha acid)
2 small cloves fresh minced garlic
1 small dried chili pepper (ancho, habañero, tabasco)
20 or 30 fresh whole fennel seeds
A pinch each of dried (not ground) oregano, basil, thyme. Other favorite pizza spices may be added.
Wyeast 1056 (American Ale) or White Labs WLP001 (California Ale) or Safale US-05
3/4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step:
In 1.5 gal. (5.7 L) of water heated to 164 °F (73 °C), mix crushed pale, amber, and crystal malts. The mash should stabilize near 151 °F (66 °C). Hold 90 min., wash with 2 gal. (7.6 L) of water at 168 °F (76 °C), and collect the runoff in your boiling kettle. Add the dried malt to the kettle and bring to a boil. Add the Willamette hop pellets, boil 60 min., remove from the heat, and add the garlic and spices. Let sit for 30 min. covered. Chill, aerate, and top off in your fermenter to 5.25 gal. (20 L) with water. Pitch yeast when wort cools to 70 °F (21 °C), seal, and ferment at 65 to 70 °F (18 to 21 °C) for 10 days. Rack to secondary and condition at 60 °F (16 °C) for two weeks or more. Prime and bottle or keg as usual.

All-Grain Option:
Increase the pale malt to 10.25 lbs. (4.7 kg) total and mash in 4 gal. (15 L) of mash water and 15 quarts (14 L) of sparge water. In either case the rest of the recipe would remain the same.

If you use a different combination of spices in your pizza sauce, by all means try it. I can't see how to do it, but somewhere in here there's room for sun-dried tomatoes, mushrooms, maybe bacon or pineapple.

Steep the crushed grains — a total of 2.0 lbs. (0.91 kg) — at 150 °F (66 °C) in 3 qts. (~3 L) of water. Add 2 gallons (7.6 L) of water to "grain tea" and boil with 2.33 lbs. (1.1 kg) of light dried malt extract. (You can heat the 2 gallons (7.6 L) of water separately while grains steep.) Boil wort for 60 minutes, adding the hops at the beginning of boil. Add 4.5 lbs. (2.0 kg) of light liquid malt extract and yeast nutrients with 15 minutes left in the boil. Cool wort and transfer to fermenter. Aerate beer and top up to 4.5 gallons (17 L) with water. Follow remaining all-grain instructions.

I’ve made this beer over a dozen times and most of the time it wins its category in competitions. It has two Best of Show trophies from the Pepper Extravaganza Competition in Florida, plus a Great American Beer Festival gold medal as the Pro-Am entry in 2013 with Cigar City Brewing Company.

Ingredients
6 lbs. (2.7 kg) Weyermann Pils malt
6 lbs. (2.7 kg) Weyermann light wheat malt
1 lb. (0.45 kg) flaked oats
2 quarts (2 L) rice hulls
4 AAU Cascade hops (60 min.) (0.75 oz./21 g at 5.5% alpha acids)
1 oz. (28 g) Indian coriander (10 min.)
0.5 oz. (14 g) dried chamomile flowers (10 min.)
1 oz. (28 g) grapefruit zest (10 min.)
3 poblano peppers (about 7 oz./200 g raw, or 4 oz./113 g treated, per instructions)
1⁄2 habanero pepper
Wyeast 3944 (Belgian Witbier) or White Labs WLP400 (Belgian Wit Ale) or
Mangrove Jack’s M21 (Belgian Wit) yeast
3⁄4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Mash the grains at 152 °F (67 °C) for 60 minutes together with 0.5 oz. (14 g) calcium chloride and the rice hulls for easier lautering. Although the rice hulls may not be necessary in some systems, it is good insurance in a fly sparge rig.

Collect the wort and boil for 60 minutes, adding the hops at the start of the boil. At ten minutes left in the boil add the coriander, citrus zest, and chamomile. Chill to 65 °F (18 °C) and pitch the yeast. Ferment until specific gravity is unchanged for three days.

When final gravity is reached it is time to prepare the peppers. Roast the peppers over an open flame until all of the outer surface is charred black. Set them aside, covered and allow them to steam until cool enough to handle. Remove the charred surface, cut off the stem and remove the placenta and seeds, then cut them into strips lengthwise and heat them in an oven for 10 minutes at 200 °F (93 °C). Once cool, add the peppers to the beer and rest for 5 to 7 days before packaging or add them directly to the keg in a hop sack or large tea strainer. Carbonate to about 2.5 volumes of CO2.

"Fill with mingled cream and amber, I will drain that glass again. Such hilarious visions clamber through the chambers of my brain. Quaintest thoughts – queerest fancies, come to life and fade away: What care I how time advances? I am drinking ale today."
– Edgar Allan Poe

Ingredients
7.0 lbs. (3.2 kg) British 2-row pale ale malt
0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) crystal malt (60 °L)
7.5 AAU Kent Golding hops (60 min.) (1.5 oz./43 g of 5% alpha acids)
2.5 AAU Kent Golding hops (10 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g of 5% alpha acids)
2.5 AAU Kent Golding hops (5 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g of 5% alpha acids)
0.5 oz. (14 g) Kent Golding hops (0 min.)
0.5 oz. (14 g) Kent Golding hops (dry hop)
Wyeast 1028 (London Ale) or White Labs WLP026 (Burton Ale) yeast
(1 qt./1 L yeast starter)

Step by Step
Mash at 153 °F (67 °C). Boil for 60 minutes, adding hops at times indicated. Pitch yeast and ferment at 68 °F (20 °C). After primary fermentation has ceased, let beer set for 2 days, then rack to secondary and add dry hops. Dry hop for 1 week.

Poe’s Boston Bitter
(5 gallons/19 L, partial mash)
OG = 1.037 FG = 1.009 IBU = 33 SRM = 9 ABV = 3.6%

Ingredients
3.5 lbs. (1.6 kg) British 2-row pale ale malt
0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) crystal malt (60 °L)
2.0 lbs. (1.4 kg) light dried malt extract (such as Muntons)
7.5 AAU Kent Golding hops (60 min.) (1.5 oz./43 g of 5% alpha acids)
2.5 AAU Kent Golding hops (10 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g of 5% alpha acids)
2.5 AAU Kent Golding hops (5 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g of 5% alpha acids)
0.5 oz. (14 g) Kent Golding hops (0 min.)
0.5 oz. (14 g) Kent Golding hops (dry hop)
Wyeast 1028 (London Ale) or White Labs WLP026 (Burton Ale) yeast
(1 qt./1 L yeast starter)

Step by Step
Mash grains at 153 °F (67 °C) for 45 minutes in 7.8 qts. (7.5 L) of water. Sparge grains to yield just short of 2.5 gallons (9.5 L) of wort. Add water to make 3.0 gallons (11 L) and add roughly one third of the malt extract. Boil wort for 60 minutes, adding hops at times indicated. Add remaining malt extract for final 15 minutes of boil. Cool wort and transfer to fermenter. Top up to 5 gallons (19 L) with cool water and pitch yeast. Ferment at 68 °F (20 °C). After primary fermentation has ceased, let beer set for 2 days, then rack to secondary and add dry hops. Dry hop for 1 week.

Extract with Grains Option:
Reduce amount of pale ale malt to 1.5 lbs. (0.68 kg) and increase amount of light dried malt extract to 3.0 lbs. (1.4 kg). Steep grains at 153 °F (67 °C) in 2.8 qts. (2.6 L) water for 45 minutes. Add water to make 3 gallons (11 L) of wort and add roughly one third of the malt extract. Boil wort for 60 minutes, adding hops at times indicated. Add remaining malt extract for final 15 minutes of boil. Cool wort, transfer to fermenter and top up to 5 gallons (19 L) with cool water. Pitch yeast and ferment at 68 °F (20 °C). After primary fermentation has ceased, let beer set for 2 days, then rack to secondary and add dry hops. Dry hop for 1 week.

Tips for Success:
Both the extract and all-grain versions convert into the partial-mash version of this recipe. Some 2-row pale ale malt is converted to light dried malt extract in the all-grain to partial-mash conversion; the opposite in the extract to partial-mash case. This beer is named for Edgar Allen Poe. This Boston-born writer, whose short stories of mystery and the macabre are still enjoyed today, was a fan of ale. This British-style bitter is well-suited to a partial-mash formulation as two thirds of the extract weight comes from grain. For best results, use fresh malt extract. This beer will condition quickly. You can easily be draining your glass 13 days after brewing.

Pomegranate Blueberry Kombucha
Pomegranate Blueberry Kombucha
(16 oz./470-mL)

Both of these fruits pack an antioxidant punch and provide a beautiful deep hue thanks to the anthocyanins. We’d recommend using pomegranate juice or mashing the arils (pomegranate seeds) for the best flavor.

Ingredients
15 oz. (440 mL) kombucha
1 Tbls. pomegranate juice
2 Tbls. fresh or frozen blue berries, lightly mashed

Step by step
Combine the ingredients in a 16-oz. (470-mL) bottle and cap tightly. Allow it to sit at room temperature for 1 to 3 days and then move to the fridge (if desired) to slow fermentation. If leaving the pieces in the bottle, consume within a week or it may be strained and stored for longer.

IBU = 31 SRM = 4 ABV = 4.4%

Anita Johnson, owner of Great Fermentations of Indiana, in Indianapolis wrote "Lighten Up!" — a story about brewing light-colored extract beers — in the October 2002 issue of BYO. Anita says, "This Kölsch recipe is a crowd pleaser. We have served it at homebrew club meetings, public beer festivals and in the Indy Runners' recovery tent at the Indianapolis 500 Festival Mini Marathon (the country's largest 1/2 marathon). I like this beer because it has lots of flavor but is light and thirst-quenching. The Wyeast 2565 leaves a tartness that I really like. So simple but yet so good!"

Ingredients
7.85 lbs. (3.56 kg) Pilsner malt
1.4 lbs. (0.64 kg) wheat malt
8 AAU Spalt hops (60 min.) (1.4 oz./40 g of 5.7% alpha acid)
Wyeast 2565 (Kölsch) or White Labs WLP029 (German Ale/Kölsch) yeast
1 cup corn sugar (for priming)

Step by Step
Mash at 148–150 °F (64–66 °C) for a drier finish. Boil for 60 minutes, adding hops at the beginning of the boil. Ferment at 65 °F (18 °C).

OG=1.061 FG=1.014 IBU=70 SRM=12.6 ABV=6.2%

Brewers Note: For fresh hops, we estimate the alpha acids to be 1⁄5 of the average acids typically associated with that hop after it is dried. This helps us to better calculate IBUs in a fresh hop beer.

Ingredients
6.6 lbs. (3 kg) light liquid malt extract syrup
1 lb. (0.45 kg) rye malt
2 lbs. 5 ounces (1.05 kg) Victory® malt
5 oz. (0.14 kg) 80 °L crystal malt
9.75 AAU Citra® hop pellets (0.75 oz./21 g at 13% alpha acids) (60 min.)
15 AAU Citra® fresh hops (6 oz./170 g of approximately 2.5% alpha acids) (15 min.)
12.5 AAU Citra® fresh hops (5 oz./141 g of approximately 2.5% alpha acids) (5 min.)
5 oz. (141 g) Citra® fresh hops (0 min.)
0.75 cup (150 g) corn sugar for bottling
Wyeast 1056 (American Ale), White Labs WLP001 (California Ale) or Safale US-05 dry yeast

Step by Step
Steep the crushed grains in approximately 2 gallons (7.6 L) of water at 150 °F (66 °C) for 30 minutes. Remove the grains from the wort and wash the grains with 2 qts (2 L) hot water. Bring the wort up to a boil, and add 1 lb. (0.45 kg) of the light malt syrup. Add your Citra® hop pellets and boil for 60 minutes. With 15 minutes left in the boil, add the first addition of Citra® fresh hops. Add the remainder of the 5.6 lbs. (2.54 kg) of liquid malt extract for the last 5 minutes of the boil and stir to thoroughly mix into the beer and avoid scorching the malt extract. When you get the malt extract mixed in, add your second addition of Citra® fresh hops and boil for 5 minutes. At the end of your 60-minute boil turn your heat off, and add your last addition of Citra® fresh hops. Steep the fresh hops in the beer for 5 minutes. Now add the wort to 2 gallons (9 L) of cold water in a sanitized fermenter and top up to 5.25 gallons (19.75 L). Cool the wort to 65 °F (18 °C) and add your yeast. Aerate your wort, and ferment at 68 °F (20 °C) until fermentation is complete.

All-Grain Option
Replace the liquid malt extract with 9.5 lbs. (4.31 kg) of 2-row pale malt. Mash at 150 °F (66 °C) for 60 minutes, and mash out at 168 °F (75 °C) for an additional 5 minutes, then collect about 6.5 gallons (24.5 L) of wort. Boil for 30 minutes without any hop additions, then boil 60 minutes with your first additions of Citra® hop pellets. Add the first addition of Citra® fresh hops with 15 minutes left in the boil. Add your second addition of Citra® fresh hops for the last 5 minutes of the boil. Turn off your burner, and now steep your last addition of fresh hops for 5 minutes, then cool your wort, fill your fermenter and ferment at 68 °F (20 °C) until fermentation is complete.

Princess Theresa’s Oktoberfestbier
(5 gallons/19 liters, all grain)
OG = 1.060 FG = 1.014 IBU = 25 SRM = 13 ABV = 5.8%

Ingredients
10.67 lbs. (4.8 kg) pale two-row (2° L)
1.3 lbs. (0.58 kg) dark Munich (20° L)
0.50 lb. (0.23 kg) crystal (60° L)
5.6 AAU Hallertauer or Mt. Hood hops (bittering) (1.3 oz./36.4 g of 4.3% alpha acid)
0.6 oz. (16.8 g) Tettnanger hops (5 min.)
0.3 oz. (8.4 g) Tettnanger hops (whirlpool)
Wyeast 2206 (Bavarian Lager), Wyeast 2308 (Munich Lager), White Labs WLP838 (Southern German Lager), or White Labs WLP920 (Old Bavarian Lager) yeast
1/2 cup DME or corn sugar

Step by Step
This beer traditionally has been brewed by the multi-step decoction method, but most experts agree that, given the quality of modern grains, infusion mashing can produce more than adequate results.

These instructions, therefore, are for a multi-step infusion mash, which starts, as is common in Germany, with dough-in at a temperature of approximately 122 °F (50 °C). Let the mash rest for about half an hour before infusing it with hot water until the temperature reaches 148 °F (64 °C). Keep the mash at that temperature for a second, 15-minute, rest. Infuse again to raise the temperature to 156 °F (69 °C) for a third rest, also of 15 minutes. Then start sparging, slowly, with almost-boiling water.

Check the mash temperature frequently during the sparge. Make sure that it does not increase beyond 170 °F (77 °C). Lower the sparge water temperature, if need be. Expect the sparge to last an hour and a half or even longer.

Check the run-off gravity frequently near the end of the sparge, and end the sparge when the gravity reaches 1.012. This avoids leaching out astringent compounds from the grain husks, which would ruin the rounded, malty character of the beer style. Then check your kettle gravity. If you need to make adjustments to your wort gravity in the kettle, do so by adding water or lengthening the boil time at the end.

Boil the Märzen-Oktoberfestbier for at least an hour and a half. Add the bittering hops one hour before shutdown (usually about 30 minutes into the boil). Add the flavor hops about 5 minutes before, and the aroma hops about 5 minutes after, shutdown. Stir the wort very gently (to avoid aeration) in a circular motion with a spatula to create a whirlpool effect. Wait about half an hour, then heat-exchange the wort as close to the fermentation temperature of 48 °F (9 °C) as your setup allows.

Aerate the cool wort, pitch the yeast, and place your fermentation vessel into a refrigerator set to the fermentation temperature. Let the brew ferment to the finish, which can take as much as three weeks!

Then rack the brew and let it "warm" up to roughly 59–64 °F (15–18 °C) for a diacetyl rest of about two days. Then pull down the brew’s temperature gradually by 2–3 °F (1–1.5 °C) a day. Keep the beer as close as possible to the optimum lagering temperature, which is approximately 28 °F (-2 °C). Lager the brew for as long as you wish, but no less than 6 weeks and no more than 6 months, after which rack the beer a final time and prime it.

Princess Theresa’s Oktoberfestbier
(5 gallons/19 liters, partial mash)
OG = 1.060 FG = 1.014 IBU = 25 SRM = 13 ABV = 5.8%

Ingredients
1 lb. (0.45 kg) dark Munich malt (20° L)
0.50 lb. (0.23 kg) crystal malt (60° L)
5.6 AAU Hallertauer or Mt. Hood hops (60 min.) (1.3 oz./36.4 g of 4.3% alpha acid)
0.6 oz. (16.8 g) Tettnanger hops (5 min.)
0.3 oz. (8.4 g) (Tettnanger hops (whirlpool)
Wyeast 2206 (Bavarian Lager), Wyeast 2308 (Munich Lager), White Labs WLP838 (Southern German Lager), or White Labs WLP920 (Old Bavarian Lager) yeast
1/2 cup DME or corn sugar

Step by Step
Coarsely mill the two specialty malts and pour them into a muslin bag. Place the bag in at least two gallons of cold water and raise the temperature slowly, for at least half an hour, until it reaches 170–190 °F (77–88 °C). At this point bubbles should start to pearl up in the liquid, but the pot must not boil! Lift the bag out of the steeping liquid and rinse it with several cups of cold water.

Do not squeeze the bag.

Discard the spent specialty grain and fill your kettle to the usual volume. Bring the liquid to a boil, turn off the heat, and stir in the canned extract.

Pumpkin Pie Ale (partial mash)
Pumpkin Pie Ale
(5 gallons/19 L, partial mash)
OG = 1.062 FG = 1.015 SRM = 5 IBU = 15 ABV = 6.4%

Ingredients
2 to 3 lbs. (0.9-1.4 kg) pie pumpkin, baked
0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) two-row pale malt
0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) wheat malt
0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) medium crystal malt (40° L)
6.6 lbs. (3 kg) amber liquid malt extract (or 5.25 lbs./2.4 kg unhopped amber dried malt extract)
1 cup light brown sugar
1/2 cup unsulphered molasses or treacle
1 oz. Mt. Hood hop pellets (60 min.)(1 oz./28 g at 4% alpha acid)
0.5 oz. (14 g) pumpkin pie spices: nutmeg, cinnamon, clove, allspice, cardamom, ginger in muslin bag
American or German ale yeast (such as Wyeast 1056, American Ale or White Labs WLP029, German Ale/Kolsch)
1 cup extra light dried malt (if priming)

Step by Step
Cut in half, clean out, and bake one pumpkin at 300 °F (150 °C) for one hour or until flesh becomes mushy. Scoop out the pumpkin meat from the shell and place in a large grain bag along with the crushed two-row and crystal malts and malted wheat. Use a potato masher to crush the pumpkin meat with the grains. Mash the malt and the pumpkin together in 5 qts. (5 L) of water at 152 °F (67 °C) for 55 minutes, then raise the temperature to 165 °F (74 °C) for five minutes. Remove the grain bag and place in a large colander. Pour 5 qts. (5 L) of hot water through the grains in order to wash out the sugars, collecting the drippings back into the kettle.

To the kettle add the liquid malt extract (or dried malt), brown sugar, and molasses. Bring to a boil, then add Mt. Hood pellets. Boil for a total of 60 minutes. Remove from heat and add pie spices in a bag. Give the wort a long stir to create a whirlpool and let settle for 15 minutes. Remove the spice bag and chill the wort, then top off to 5.25 gals. (20 L) in your primary fermenter. Ferment with a clean ale yeast at the cooler side of the suggested fermentation temperature range. Prime with the dried malt, and bottle condition cool (50° to 55 °F/10 to 13 °C) for a month. Serve at cellar temperature to allow the blend of flavors to truly express themselves.

Notes:
Pumpkin: I like to use whole pumpkins. If you can find the sweeter "pie" or "sugar" varieties, I recommend using one of those types. It is important to use a partial mash with this recipe; to get the starch in the pumpkin converted.

Malts: All-grain brewers can adapt this recipe to a standard "amber ale" grain bill, but be sure to include a little more malted wheat for better head retention. Extract brewers may have trouble using the pumpkin unless they do a partial mash as described above.

Spices: The biggest problem with this brew is the proper ratio of spice to beer. It is very easy to overdo, especially with strong-flavored spices such as ginger and clove. I have arrived at a dose of only 0.5 oz. (14 g) total, which will not seem like enough as you brew but will be noticeable in the mature beer.

My personal blend is "heavy" on nutmeg and cinnamon and very light on ginger and clove, just enough to indicate their presence. IÕve found that leaving the spices in the fermenting beer tends to become overwhelming, hence the use of a bag or some other device to steep the spices in the wort but then remove them.

The commercial "Pumpkin Pie Spice" mixtures available on the grocery store shelf seem to me a little too gingery/clovey, so I make my own blend. Also, I have better luck with larger pieces: crushed or shaved whole cinnamon stick, allspice berries and nutmegs, whole cloves, and small pieces of fresh ginger rather than any finely ground forms.

Pyment
Tropical Pyment
(5 gallons/19 L)

Ingredients:
6 lbs. (2.7 kg) orange blossom honey
96-oz. (2.8 L) can Chenin Blanc grape juice concentrate (or your choice of other wine-grape juice)
4 large pomegranates
10 kiwi fruit
Juice of 2 oranges
8 tsp acid blend
0.25 teaspoon sulfite
1.5 tsp tannin
2 tsp pectic enzyme
2.5 teaspoons potassium sorbate
7.5 to 9 ounces of sugar for final sweetening
Wine yeast of choice

Step by step
Dissolve honey in enough warm water to bring volume to just over six gallons (23 L). Add rest of ingredients except sulfite, pectic enzyme, fruit and yeast. Remove about 1 cup (237 mL) of must and heat it to 80 °F (27 °C), pitch yeast into cup of warm must. Add sulfite to the 6 gallons (23 L) of must and cover. After 12-24 hours add the cup of fermenting mead starter to the 6 gallons (23 L) of must and stir well.

Cover and fit airlock. Check must in 24 hours and stir, then add fruit and pectic enzyme to must. Ferment mead to dryness or near dryness and rack to secondary container. You may add a common fining agent if mead is dry at this racking, or allow the mead to clear naturally. Rack mead again in 3-4 weeks, and then again in 4-6 weeks (add a pinch of sulfite at each racking).

Allow mead to clear and age for 4-6 months. For final sweetening 2 to 2.5% residual sugar is suggested. Dissolve 2.5 teaspoons of potassium sorbate in a small bit of water, and stir into the mead. Add the sweetening sugar. If mead is at room temperatures, you can stir the sugar right into the mead. If mead is at cooler temperatures, remove 2-3 cups of the mead and heat it to 80 °F (27 °C) in a sanitized pan, and dissolve your sugar in this. Add to mead and stir. Wait several days before bottling.

Anoka Pumpkin Patch Ale
Anoka Pumpkin Patch Ale
(5 gallons, extract with grains)
OG = 1.058 FG = 1.020 SRM = 7 IBU = 19 ABV = 5.0%

This pumpkin ale commemorates the famous Halloween celebration that's held every year in Anoka, Minnesota.

Ingredients
6 lbs. (2.7 kg) Briess light malt extract
2 lbs. (0.91 kg) fresh pumpkin or 2 lbs. of canned pumpkin (no preservatives)
0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) crystal malt (10° L)
0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) CaraPils malt
1 lb. (0.45 kg) light brown sugar
5 AAU Mt. Hood hops (60 min.) (1.0 oz./28 g at 5% alpha acid)
0.5 tsp. cinnamon
0.5 tsp. nutmeg
Wyeast 1056 (American Ale), White Labs WLP001 (California Ale) or Safale US-05 yeast
0.75 cup corn sugar (for bottling)

Step by Step
If using fresh pumpkin, cut the pumpkin in half. Clean and bake for about one hour or until it gets mushy. Otherwise, empty contents of canned pumpkin into a grain bag. Steep the grains and pumpkin together in about 1.5 gallons of water at 155°F for one hour. Remove grains and pumpkin. Again, if using fresh pumpkin, place in strainer and sparge with about five quarts of water at approximately 170°F, collecting a total of about two gallons of wort. Add malt extract and brown sugar. Bring to a boil. Add Mt. Hood hop pellets and boil for one hour. Add spices in hop bag and boil just long enough to infuse the flavors into the wort, about two to three minutes. Combine wort with water to make five gallons. Pitch yeast when wort temperature is under 80°F or ideally under 75°F. Ferment in primary fermenter at 65–75°F for seven to 10 days, then rack to secondary for seven to 14 days. Prime and bottle. Bottle conditioning for at least two weeks is required but a better product may be achieved after a month of conditioning.

Rabbit’s Foot Meadery's Sweet Mead clone
Rabbit’s Foot Meadery Sweet Mead clone
(5 gallons/19L, honey)
OG = 1.110 FG = 1.030 ABV = 12%

The following recipe is for our award-winning sweet mead.

Ingredients
15 lbs. (6.8 kg) wildflower honey
5 tsp. yeast nutrient
5 tsp. DAP (diammonium phosphate)
5 tbsp. bentonite
2 pkg. Lalvin EC-1118 yeast

Step by Step
Use the finest wildflower honey that you have available. Blend your 15 lbs. (6.8 kg) of wildflower honey with about 2 gallons (7.6 L) of boiling water and stir well. Do not boil the mixture. Add the additional water (2–3 gallons/7.6–11 L) a little at a time until the specific gravity reaches 1.110. You should end up with around 5 gallons (19 L), but you may have a little more or less depending on the density of the honey. For this recipe, you should use two packets of Lalvin EC-1118 yeast. More yeast to start is better. Rehydrate the yeast in a cup of 104 °F (40 °C) water for 30 minutes, then mix it into the honey and water mixture. Pour the contents of the batch back and forth into an additional sanitized fermentation bucket to aerate.

Add 5 tsp. of yeast nutrient and 5 tsp. of DAP. Add 50% of your nutrients now and allow to begin fermenting. The next day you should see signs of fermentation. Add the remainder of your nutrients.

Ferment until the specific gravity reaches 1.030-1.035 and add 1 tbsp. bentonite per gallon mixed into a slurry. Allow this mixture to settle out and the following day stir it up again. Following this, the mead will clear rapidly but still continue to ferment. Watch the gravity for the next few days until it reaches 1.030 and then rack it off the lees (sediment). If you have the ability to filter the mead, go ahead and do it now. Ideally, you would bulk age this mead for a month or two before drinking, but it should be quite nice right away.

Bottle the mead still (without bottling sugar for carbonation) The final alcohol content will be around 12% ABV.

What screams summer more than a wit beer? Try a little twist this season with Adventures in Homebrewing’s Rapscallion Tangerine Ginger Wit. This recipe is a light wit with a magnified dry finish due to the light addition of ginger. If you like your wits with a little more octane, try a pound of honey in the secondary. Serve in a Pilsner glass with a slice of blood orange.

Ingredients
6 lbs. (2.7 kg) wheat liquid malt extract
0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) aromatic malt
0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) white wheat malt
8 AAU Northern Brewer hops (60 min.) (1 oz./28 g at 8% alpha acids)
1 oz. (28 g) ginger root (5 min.)
1 oz. (28 g) tangerine peel (5 min.)
Wyeast 3944 (Belgian Witbier), White Labs WLP400 (Belgian Wit Ale), or Lallemand Abbaye Ale yeast.
3⁄4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by step
Add crushed grains to a muslin bag and place in 2.5 gallons (9.5 L) of water in your brew pot. Slowly raise the temperature to 150–160 °F (66–71 °C). Steep your grains at this temperature for 20 minutes. Remove the bagged grains from the pot and allow the liquid to drain from the bag into the pot. Bring wort to a boil and then remove from heat. Stir in the malt extract until it has all dissolved, being sure not to scorch any on the bottom of the pot. Return kettle to the heat and boil 60 minutes, adding hops, ginger root, and tangerine peel as indicated.

Cool the wort to ~100 °F (38 °C) as quickly as possible. Transfer the wort into the primary fermenter and top off with cold water until a total of 5.13 gallons (19.4 L) is reached. Aerate the wort and pitch the yeast when the wort cools to 78 °F (26 °C). Ferment at your chosen yeast’s optimal temperature. Once the primary fermentation is complete, bottle or keg as normal.

The OG is prior to souring. The FG and ABV include the impact of the fruit addition. The SRM is for the base wort/beer: The raspberries will add a beautiful pink/red color that doesn’t fit the SRM scale.

Ingredients
4.7 lbs. (2.13 kg) German Pilsner malt
4.7 lbs. (2.13 kg) pale wheat malt
5 lbs. (2.3 kg) frozen raspberries
0.75 oz. (21 g) Indian coriander, freshly ground (15 min.)
0.5 oz. (14 g) sea salt (15 min.)
Distilled water
1⁄2 tsp. yeast nutrient (10 min.)
2 Goodbelly StraightShots or 4 Swanson Probiotic L. plantarum capsules
White Labs WLP001 (California Ale) or Wyeast 1056 (American Ale) or SafAle US-05 yeast
3⁄4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Mill the grains and dough-in targeting a mash of around 1.5 quarts of water per pound of grain (3.1 L/kg) and a temperature of 150 °F (66 °C). Add lactic acid as needed to target a mash pH of 5.2. Hold the mash at 150 °F (66 °C) for 60 minutes. Sparge or mash-out and lauter with enough water to yield a total volume of 5 gallons (19 L) of wort.

Heat wort to 180 °F (82 °C) in the brew kettle and hold for 8 minutes to pasteurize. Chill the wort to 95 °F (35 °C). Transfer the chilled wort to a sanitized, purged souring keg. Do not aerate. Add the Goodbelly shots or the inner contents of the Swanson capsules to the keg. Seal the keg and purge with CO2, leaving about 20 PSI of pressure in the headspace after purging.

Allow the L. plantarum to sour the wort for about 48 hours at 95 °F (35 °C), until the pH drops to about 3.5.

After souring, transfer the wort to a boil kettle and add the amount of distilled water expected to boil off over a 60-minute period. Boil for 60 minutes, adding the coriander, sea salt, and yeast nutrient according to the ingredient list.

Turn off the heat and chill the wort to 68 °F (20 °C) or slightly cooler. Transfer the cooled wort to a "clean beer" fermenter, aerate, and pitch the yeast targeting about 200 billion cells. Ferment at 68 °F (20 °C) until gravity is a few points above terminal.

Thaw and crush the raspberries. Rack beer into a secondary fermenter on top of the raspberries. Ferment for about a week at 68 °F (20 °C), until the sugars in the raspberries are fermented out.

If bottle conditioning, carbonate the beer to around 2.5 volumes of CO2. If kegging, carbonate as high as 3.5 volumes.

3⁄4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Fill the brew kettle with 4.95 gallons (18.7 L) water. Heat to about 160 °F (71 °C). Turn off heat, add the extract, and stir to dissolve. Heat wort to 180 °F (82 °C) in the brew kettle and hold for 8 minutes to pasteurize.

Chill the wort to 95 °F (35 °C) and follow the remainder of the instructions in the all-grain recipe.

Tips for success:
If souring in a kettle instead of a dedicated souring keg, flood the kettle headspace (if possible) with CO2 and cover as tightly as possible. Keep the kettle close to 95 °F (35 °C).

You can add lactic acid to bring the wort pH to about 4.5 or lower before pitching the L. plantarum. This will make the job easier for the bacteria and improve foam retention. If you don’t have a pH meter, about 8–9 mL 88% lactic acid per 5 gallons (19 L) of wort (starting at 5.2 pH) will be useful and should get you in the ballpark.

Using more L. plantarum than called for can also accelerate the souring process. Also, fresher L. plantarum will work faster than older L. plantarum.

Leaving 20 PSI of pressure in the souring keg’s headspace after purging helps ensure positive pressure to keep the keg sealed, as most of the headspace CO2 is slowly absorbed by the wort. If you do not have a spunding valve, check the keg’s pressure periodically and if the souring keg’s pressure actually increases (unlikely), bleed some of it off using the pressure relief valve.

The Saccharomyces fermentation will be somewhat slowed by the acidity of the wort. This is normal. The yeast is operating under less than ideal conditions (low pH), but will get the job done.

For a more tradition Gose, hop to 8 IBUs in the boil with any noble hop, skip the raspberries and the secondary, and package the beer when it reaches terminal gravity.

Raspberry Melomel
Raspberry Melomel
(1 gallon, 3.8 L)

Ingredients
3 pounds (1.63 kg) honey
2 pounds (0.91 kg) raspberries
1/2 cup sucrose (table sugar)
2 tsp. acid blend (like Vinacid R)
10 drops liquid pectic enzyme
1 tsp. yeast nutrient
1 packet Red Star Montrachet yeast

Step By Step
In a large, non-reactive kettle boil the honey and some water. The ratio should be one part honey to two parts water; use the empty honey container to measure the water. Boil for 10 to 20 minutes, skimming off any scum and foam.

Add the raspberries, gently crushed, to the hot honey and let cool until warm. If you did not boil the honey, treat the following step as your first step.

Add raspberries, honey, sugar and acid blend to your primary fermenter. I’d recommend a plastic fermenter with a lid and airlock. Mix thoroughly. Then add the pectic enzyme, yeast nutrient and enough cold, preboiled water to make one gallon, mixing well.

Disperse the yeast in one cup warm water. Let stand for 10 to 15 minutes. If the liquid is bubbly and frothy, add to the honey-berry mixture, stirring gently to disperse the yeast. If the yeast have not activated, it might mean your yeast is old or has lost its ability to rehydrate. In that case, buy a new packet from your local homebrew supplier.

Let stand in a warm place (70° to 78 °F/21 to 26 °C). Monitor the sugar level (specific gravity) to check for fermentation progression by using a hydrometer occasionally. Stir the must twice daily to keep the floating "cap" of fermenting fruit moist.

After the most vigorous fermentation period is over (about 5 to 10 days), strain the solid material out of the primary fermenter into another clean bucket. Siphon this liquid into a clean one-gallon jug and top up with cold, preboiled water if necessary. Top with a bung and fermentation lock.

Melomels need to be racked every two to three months, depending upon the amount of sediment in the bottom of the jug. The fermentation of this medium-sweet melomel may take a month to finish, and even when the yeast activity stops it may not be dry. Whatever turns out to be the case, you should rack three times before bottling. If necessary, top up with cold, preboiled water to prevent oxidation.

When racking, siphon the clear melomel into another clean one-gallon jug and top up with cold, preboiled water. Fit the jug with a clean bung and fermentation lock. After another week, check the titratable acidity (g/L) of your melomel. If it is much below 5 g/L or tastes flat, try adding your favorite acid blend in order to bring the TA up to around 7 g/L.

After the last racking and before bottling, if you have the equipment, you could filter the mead into a clean carboy. After the acid’s adjusted (and after you’ve filtered, if you did), potassium sorbate will prevent a re-fermentation in the bottle.

After waiting one month, if you wish to bottle your melomel, do so. Adding wine conditioner is an optional step that might improve the body and mouthfeel of the final product. If using, mix well into the wine before you bottle it. Bottle-age for 6 months before consumption.

Raspberry Porter
(5 gallons,/19 L, partial mash)
OG = 1.053 FG = 1.014
SRM = 30 IBU = 21 ABV = 5.1%

Ingredients
5 lbs. (2.3 kg) extra light dried malt extract
1.5 lbs. (0.68 kg) pale malt (2-row)
6 oz. (170 g) chocolate malt (350 °L)
5 oz. (142 g) roasted barley (500 °L)
3 oz. (85 g) black patent malt
3.75 lbs. (1.7 kg) raspberries (frozen)
7.5 AAU Northern Brewer hops (1.0 oz./28 g of 7.5% alpha acid)
1 tsp. Irish moss (15 min.)
Wyeast 1056 (American Ale) or White Labs WLP001 (California Ale) yeast
0.75 cup corn sugar (for priming)

Step by Step
Put pale malt and dark specialty grains — both crushed — in a large grain bag. Heat three quarts of water to 165 °F (74 °C) and submerge grain bag. Steep grains between 154 to 158 °F (68 to 70 °C) for 30 minutes. Rinse grains with three quarts of water at 168–170 °F (76-77 °C), then set bag and grains aside. Add water to steeping water to make at least three gallons (11.4 L), but preferably four gallons (15 L) and bring to a boil. Remove from heat and stir in extract.

Resume heating and boil wort for 1 hour. Add hops for final 45 minutes of the boil. Add Irish moss for final 15 minutes of boil. Cool wort and transfer to sanitized fermenter. Add cold water to make 5.25 gallons (20 L). Aerate wort and add yeast starter at 68 °F (20 °C). Ferment for one week at 68°F (20 °C). After the first week, add frozen raspberries to a sanitized fermentation bucket and crush with a potato masher.

Rack beer onto raspberries and let ferment for an additional week. Bottle with 3/4 cup of corn sugar. Let bottles condition at room temperature for two weeks, then refrigerate for one week. To serve, pour beer into a tall glass, such as a wheat beer glass. Examine the color by holding glass up to light, inhale the aroma and then drink.

Raspberry Robust Porter
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.064 (15.7 °P) / 1.066 (16.2 °P) with fruit
FG = 1.017 (4.4 °P)
IBU = 30 SRM = 37 ABV = 6.5%
Ingredients
10.4 lb. (4.7 kg) American two-row malt (2 °L)
1.5 lb. (0.68 kg) Durst Munich malt (8 °L)
14 oz. (397 g) crystal malt (40 °L)
11.0 oz. (312 g) chocolate malt (350 °L)
7.0 oz. (198 g) black patent malt (525 °L)
3.0 lb. (1.36 kg) Oregon Fruit Products raspberry puree
6.65 AAU Kent Goldings pellet hops (60 min.) (1.33 oz./38 g at 5% alpha acid)
White Labs WLP001 (California Ale), Wyeast 1056 (American Ale) or Fermentis Safale US-05 yeast

Step by Step
Mill the grains and dough-in targeting a mash of around 1.5 quarts of water to 1 pound of grain (a liquor-to-grist ratio of about 3:1 by weight) and a temperature of 154 °F (68 °C). Hold the mash at 154 °F (68 °C) until enzymatic conversion is complete. Infuse the mash with near boiling water while stirring or with a recirculating mash system raise the temperature to mash out at 168 °F (76 °C). Sparge slowly with 170 °F (77 °C) water, collecting wort until the pre-boil kettle volume is around 6.5 gallons (24.4 L) and the gravity is 1.050 (12.3 °P).

The total wort boil time is 90 minutes. Add the bittering hops with 60 minutes remaining in the boil. Add Irish moss or other kettle finings with 15 minutes left in the boil. Chill the wort rapidly to 67 °F (19 °C), let the break material settle, rack to the fermenter, pitch the yeast and aerate thoroughly.

Use 12 grams of properly rehydrated dry yeast, 2.5 liquid yeast packages, or make an appropriate starter. Ferment at 67 °F (19 °C). When initial fermentation begins to slow, add raspberry puree to a second fermenter and carefully rack the beer onto the fruit. Fermentation should pick up again as the yeast consumes the fructose in the fruit puree. Once fermentation finishes, carbonate to approximately 2 to 2.5 volumes.

Extract with Grains Option:
Replace the American two-row and Munich malt with 3.3 lb (1 kg) of a blended Munich liquid malt extract and 4.5 lb (2 kg) of a pale or light liquid malt extract. Mill or coarsely crack the specialty malts. Mix them well and place loosely in a grain bag. Steep the bag in 1 gallon (~4 liters) of 170 °F (77 °C) water for about 30 minutes. Lift the grain bag out of the steeping liquid and rinse with warm water. Let the bag drip into the kettle while you add the malt extract. Do not squeeze the bags. Add enough water to the steeping liquor and malt extract to make a pre-boil kettle volume around 6.5 gallons (24.4 L) and the gravity is 1.050 (12.3 °P). Follow the remaining instructions for the all-grain recipe.

(5 gallons/ 19 L extract with grain)
OG = 1.055 FG = 1.014
IBU = 32 SRM = 23 ABV = 5.5 %

Ingredients
3.3 lbs. (1.5 kg) Muntons unhopped light malt extract
2.25 lb. (1 kg) light dried malt extract
1.25 lb. (0.56 kg) crystal malt (60 ºL)
10 oz. (0.28 kg) Vienna malt
0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) chocolate malt
1/2 tsp. yeast nutrient (15 min.)
8.25 AAU English Target hop pellets (60 min.) (0.75 oz./21 g of 11.0% alpha acid)
1.25 AAU Willamette hop pellets (10 min.) (.25 oz./7g of 5% alpha acid)
White Labs WLP 002 (English Ale) or Wyeast 1098 (British Ale) yeast
0.75 cup (150 g) of corn sugar for priming (if bottling)

Step by Step
Steep the crushed grain in 3 gallons (11.4 L) of water at 155 ºF (6 ºC) for 30 minutes. Remove grains from the wort, add the liquid extract and bring to a boil. Add the first additions of English Target hops andboil for 60 minutes.

During the boil, use this time to thoroughly sanitize a fermenter. Add the yeast nutrient after 45 minutes of boiling. Add the last addition of Willamette hops and boil for final 10 minutes of the boil. Now add the wort to 2 gallons (7.6 L) of cold water in the sanitized fermenter and top off with cold water up to 5 gallons (19 L).

Cool the wort to 75 ºF (24 ºC). Pitch your yeast and aerate the wort heavily. Allow the beer to cool to 68 ºF (20 ºC). Hold at that temperature until fermentation is complete. Transfer to a carboy, avoiding any splashing to prevent aerating the beer. Let the beer condition for one week and then bottle or keg. Allow to carbonate for 2 weeks and enjoy your brown ale!

All-grain option:
This is a single step infusion mash. Replace the malt syrup and DME with 8.5 lbs. (3.83 kg) 2-row pale malt and 1 lb. (0.45 kg) Munich malt. The other grains remain the same. Mix the crushed grain with 4 gallons (15.2 L) of 170 °F (77 °C) water to stabilize at 154 ºF (68 ºC) for 60 minutes. Sparge slowly with 175 ºF (79 ºC) water.

Collect approximately 6 gallons (23 L) of wort runoff to boil for 60 minutes. Reduce the first addition (60 minute) of English Target hops to 6.6 AAU (0.6 oz./17 g) due to the higher utilization factor for a full wort boil. The remainder of this recipe is the same as the extract with grain recipe.

Make the date wine (see below), then bake the bappir (see below) one or two days later. Let bappir cool overnight. The next day, add crushed malt and crumbled bread to your kettle. Mash in to 131 °F (55 °C) with 3.0 gallons (11 L) of water. Immediately begin slowly heating the mash to 156 °F (69 °C), stirring constantly, then rest at 156 °F (69 °C) for 45 minutes. Heat mash to 170 °F (77 °C) and transfer it to your lauter tun. Stir in rice hulls. Let sit for 5 minutes, then recirculate briefly and run off wort to kettle. Collect 4.0 gallons (15 L) total. Boil for 15 minutes, then cool to 70 °F (21 °C).

Remove bag of date skins from fermenter. (If you can get a friend to hold the bag, you can use two cookie sheets to gently press the pulp and yield a bit more juice.) Combine fermenting date wine with your fresh wort, then stir in honey. Add water to make 5 gallons (19 L), aerate and let ferment at 70–80 °F (21–27 °C) until fermentation subsides. Keg or bottle.

Date Wine:
(1.0 gallon/3.8 L, fruit wine)
OG = 1.092

Ingredients
3.5 lbs. (1.6 kg) dates

Step by Step
Pit dates and place them in a large nylon grain bag. Put fruit bag in the bottom of a sanitized bucket fermenter and crush the fruit with a potato masher (or your feet). Add water to make 1 gallon (3.8 L). Let the wild yeast on the fruit begin to ferment the juice.

Bappir (Beer Bread):
Ingredients
3.0 lbs. (1.4 kg) Weyermann rauchmalz (smoked malt)
1.0 lb. (0.45 kg) unbleached (wheat) flour
1.25 lbs. (0.57 kg) honey

Step by Step
Grind barley malt into flour. Combine dry ingredients in a large mixing bowl. Fold in honey. Slowly add water and knead dough until it is roughly the consistency of cookie dough. Form dough into large, flat loaves about one inch (2.5 cm) thick. Bake at 350 °F (176 °C) on a pizza stone until outside browns. Remove from oven and let cool. Cut cooled bread into "logs" about 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) thick (think biscotti). Rebake at 350 °F (176 °C) until bread just hardens. Let cool overnight.

Real Root Beer (hard/alcoholic version)
(5 gallons/19 L, partial mash)
OG = 1.052 FG = 1.020
IBU = 25 SRM = 33 ABV = 4.3%

Ingredients
2 lbs. (0.91 kg) mild ale malt
1 lb. (0.45 kg) dark crystal malt (120 °L)
0.25 lb. (113 g) black malt
0.25 lb. (113 g) chocolate malt
3.5 lbs. (1.6 kg) dark dried malt extract
0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) dark unsulphured molasses
6 oz. (170 g) maltodextrin powder
7 AAU Cluster hop pellets (60 min.) (1 oz./28 g at 7% alpha acids)
0.5 oz. (14 g) sassafras bark (0 min.)
0.5 oz. (14 g) sarsaparilla bark (0 min.)
1 oz. (28 g) dried wintergreen leaves (0 min.)
0.5 oz. (14 g) shredded licorice root (0 min.)
pinch sweet gale (optional) (0 min.)
pinch star anise (optional) (0 min.)
pinch mace (optional) (0 min.)
pinch coriander (optional) (0 min.)
0.5 cup black cherry juice (optional) (0 min.)
0.5 cup spice tea (pinch wintergreen, sarsaparilla, licorice root) (at bottling)
Safale US-05 or Lallemand BRY-97 (West Coast Ale) or Mangrove Jack's M44 (US West Coast Ale)
7/8 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
In 5 qts. (4.7 L) water, mash the crystal, black, chocolate, and mild ale malts at 155 °F (68 °C) for 60 minutes. Wash the grains with 1.5 gals. (7.6 L) at 170 °F (77 °C). Add 1 gal. (4 L) of water to kettle and bring to a boil. Add dark dried malt extract, maltodextrin, and molasses. Stir well to avoid scorching. Add Cluster hops and boil 60 minutes. At kettle knockout, steep your spice combination (in a mesh bag) for 15 minutes. Chill the wort, then pour into fermenter and top up to 5.25 gals (20 L). Cool to 75 °F (23 °C) and pitch ale yeast. Ferment 7 to 10 days at about 68 °F (20 °C), rack to secondary, and condition at 60 °F (16 °C) for two weeks. Prime with corn sugar, add strained spice tea (1/2 cup boiling water over spices for at least a half hour), and bottle or keg. Age two to three weeks cool (55 °F/13 °C).

Soft/Non-alcoholic creamy version::
Instead of fermenting the wort, cool to 75 °F (23 °C) and substitute 5 to 7 g dry champagne yeast for the ale yeast, and bottle immediately. Store at 70 °F (21 °C) for two or three days, then refrigerate. Follow these instructions exactly, otherwise you risk exploding bottles. You may also use ale yeast, which is somewhat safer because it will not continue to ferment in cold temperatures. However, the bubbles will not have that fine champagne quality. A safer way to carbonate: Get a CO2 system and either put your root beer in 5-gal. (19 L) soda kegs (force carbonated) or get Carbonater-brand couplings and bottle in 2-liter PET bottles (force carbonated at 25 to 28 psi, chilled and shaken well).

Red Car Brewing's Two Rail Pale Ale
Two Rail Pale Ale clone
Red Car Brewing Co., CA
(5 gallons/ 19 L, extract with grains)
OG = 1.054 FG = 1.011
IBU = 36 SRM = 13 ABV = 5.6%

Ingredients
6.6 lbs. (3.0 kg) Coopers Light, unhopped, malt extract
0.5 lbs. (0.22 kg) light dried malt extract
9 oz. (0.25 kg) crystal malt (60 °L)
2 oz. (57 g) chocolate malt
6.5 AAU Nugget hops (60 min.) (0.5 oz./ 14 g of 13% alpha acid)
4 AAU Willamette hops (30 min.) (0.8 oz./ 23g of 5% alpha acid)
1.7 AAU Cascade hop pellets (5 min.) (0.3 oz./8.5g of 5.75% alpha acid)
1⁄2 tsp. yeast nutrient (15 min.)
White Labs WLP002 (English Ale) or Wyeast 1098 (English Ale) or Lallemand London ESB Ale yeast
0.75 cup (150 g) of corn sugar (for priming)

Step by Step
Steep the crushed grain in 2.5 gallons (9.5 L) of water at 149 ºF (65 ºC) for 30 minutes. Remove grains from the wort and rinse with 2.0 quarts (1.9 L) of hot water. Add the liquid and dried malt extracts and bring to a boil. While boiling, add the hops as per the hopping schedule. During the boil, use this time to thoroughly sanitize a fermenter. Add the yeast nutrient after 45 minutes of boiling. Now add the wort to 2.0 gallons (7.6 L) of cold water in the sanitized fermenter and top off with cold water up to 5 gallons (19 L).

Cool the wort to 75 ºF (24 ºC). Pitch your yeast and aerate the wort heavily. Allow the beer to cool to 68 ºF (20 ºC). Hold at that temperature until fermentation is complete. Transfer to a carboy, avoiding any splashing to prevent aerating the beer. Let the beer condition for one week and then bottle or keg. Allow to carbonate and condition for two additional weeks and enjoy your pale ale.

All-grain option: This is a single step infusion mash. Replace the malt syrup and dried extract with 10.5 lbs. (4.76 kg) of 2-row pale malt grain. The specialty grains remain the same. Mix the crushed grains with 4.5 gallons (17 L) of 167 °F (75 °C) water to stabilize at 149 ºF (65 ºC) for 60 minutes. Sparge slowly with 175 ºF (79 ºC) water. Collect approximately 6 gallons (23 L) of wort runoff to boil for 60 minutes.

Reduce the bittering hop (60 mins) and flavor hop (30 mins) amounts to 0.4 oz (11.3 g) and 0.75 oz (21.3 g) respectively to allow for the higher utilization factor of a full wort boil. The remainder of this recipe is the same as the extract with grain recipe.

Apple Pseudo-Lambic
Apple Pseudo-Lambic
(5 gallons/19 L, extract with grains)
OG = 1.049 FG = 1.005
IBU = 9 SRM = 4 ABV = 5.9%

Ingredients:
5 lbs. (2.27 kg) wheat dried malt extract
0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) crystal malt (20° L)
0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) cracked wheat malt
2.6 AAU Saaz hop pellets (45 min.) (0.75 oz./21 g at 3.5% alpha acids)
4-5 lbs. (1.8-2.3 kg) fresh sour green apples, chopped
Wyeast 3278 (Belgian Lambic Blend) or White Labs WLP655 (Sour Mix 1)
SafAle US-05 (optional)
3/4 cup corn sugar (for priming)

Step by Step:
In 2.5 gals. (9.5 L) of cold water, steep crystal and cracked wheat malt. Bring gradually up to 170 °F (77 °C) and remove the grains. As water comes to a boil, remove briefly from the heat and stir in dry malt extract. Stir until all the extract has dissolved, then return to heat. When the wort begins to boil, add hop pellets and boil 45 minutes. Remove from heat, cool quickly, and add enough chilled, sterile water to make up 5 gals. in your fermenter. When cooled to 75 °F (24 °C), pitch yeast. [If you want a cleaner style of beer, I recommend pitching a pack of a clean ale yeast such as SafAle US-05 or Lallemand Nottingham yeast at this point and the lambic blend after primary fermentation. For a funkier version, pitch the lambic blend now.]

Ferment relatively warm (70 to 75 °F/21 to 24 °C) until the first phase of fermentation is done (three to five days, usually), then rack into a secondary in which you have already placed the chopped apples. If you went the cleaner lambic route, pitch prepared Wyeast 3278, close up, and condition cool (50 to 55 °F/10 to 13 °C) for 10 to 15 days.

Prime with corn sugar, bottle (carefully avoiding apple debris as you siphon), and age four to six weeks to allow the flavors to blend well.

Tips For Success:
The cracked wheat malt is placed in the recipe for a specific reason, to provide food for the critters that can digest the wheat flour. This is something normal brewer's yeast cannot ferment. A traditional way to brew a Lambic ale was to perform a turbid mash which set aside portions of the mash that allowed some starch to get through the mashing process. The cracked wheat is used as a substitute for this recipe

This is only an approximation of a lambic style, well within the abilities of the average homebrewer. For a more authentic lambic, which is difficult but usually worth it, please refer to Jean-Xavier Guinard's Lambic, volume three of the Brewers Publications Classic Beer Style Series.

Fruit: Obviously, apple is not the only fruit possibility here. Whatever you've got, try it. In combinations, too. If you have several one-gallon jugs, split a batch into five and try five different fruits, one pound of each.

Hops: Belgian brewers of lambics generally use hops only for their preservative value (and they often use stale, faded hops at that!). No real bitterness or aroma is needed here, although a mild flavoring hop is not out of place.

Yeast: There are plenty of other lambic bacteria cultures on the market. Check with your supplier for his or her recommendation or look around the internet to see what is available.

OG = 1.046 FG = 1.011
IBU = 21 SRM = 21 ABV = 4.4%

Ingredients
6.6 lb. (3.0 kg) Briess Golden light liquid malt extract
8.0 oz. (0.23 kg) crystal malt (60 °L)
4.5 AAU Hallertau hops (60 min.) (1.0 oz./28 g of 4.5% alpha acids)
6 AAU Cascade hops (5 min.) (1.0 oz./28 g of 6% alpha acids)
4.0 oz. (113 g) cherry flavor extract (3 lbs./1.4 g of cherry fruit puree can be substituted for a fruitier finish)
Muntons Ale yeast
5.0 oz. (142 g) priming sugar

Step by Step
Pour two gallons (7.6 L) of clean water into a 4-gallon (15-L) or larger pot. Pour crushed grains into the cloth bag and tie the end into a knot to close it. Place the grain filled bag into the brew pot water and heat to approximately 160–170 °F (71–77 °C). Remove the grain bag and allow it to drain into the brew pot without squeezing and discard.

Heat the brew pot water to boiling. Remove kettle from heat. Add the malt extract syrup. Stir well and return to heat. Stir constantly until it returns to a boil. Add bittering hops. Do not use the kettle lid. Boil for 55 minutes, stirring occasionally, then add finishing hops. Boil for an additional five minutes (total boiling time is 60 minutes). You will add the flavor extract to taste just prior to bottling (add optional puree to the primary fermentation). Cool the wort rapidly to 70 °F (21 °C).

Pour the brewpot contents into a sanitized 6.5-gallon (25-L) food grade plastic fermenter. With the cooled wort in the plastic fermenter, add 70 °F (21 °C) water until the level reaches the 5-gallon (19-L) mark on the bucket. Sprinkle the contents of the yeast packet on top of the wort and stir well. Place the fermenter in a 68–72 °F (20–22 °C) environment.

(0.25 kg) of the crystal malt and 3 oz. (85 g) of the chocolate malt. Mix the crushed grain with 3.5 gallons (15.9 L) of 168 °F (76 °C) water to stabilize at 150 ºF (66 ºC) for 60 minutes.

Sparge slowly with 175 ºF (79 ºC) water. Collect approximately 6 gallons (23 L) of wort runoff to boil for 60 minutes. Reduce the 60-minute hop addition to 1.25 oz. (35 g) to allow for the higher utilization factor of a full wort boil. The remainder of this recipe’s procedures are the same as the extract with grain recipe.

Red Queen Ale
Red Queen Ale
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.044 FG = 1.008
IBU = 24 SRM = 10 ABV = 4.6%

In Lewis Carroll's "Through the Looking-Glass," Alice encounters the Red Queen, who needs to keep running as fast as she can just to stay in place. Like the Red Queen, brewers will be doing some scrambling just to hold their ground in 2008. due to the hop shortage In my Red Queen Ale, I tried to come up with a recipe that made the most of some ingredients that should be plentiful, and of high quality, this year. I chose Santiam and Sterling hops because I liked their spicy character. This year, the US crop of 6-row barley was excellent, whereas 2-row barley crops around the world were variable. This beer is dry and the Nottingham yeast leaves a refreshing crispness.

Ingredients
4.5 lbs. (2.0 kg) 6-row pale malt
2.25 lbs. (1.0 kg) 2-row pale malt
8.0 oz. (0.22 kg) crystal malt (90 °L)
2.25 lbs. (1.0 kg) flaked maize
2.3 AAU Sterling hops (60 min.) (0.46 oz./13 g of 5% alpha acids)
2.3 AAU Santiam hops (60 min.) (0.38 oz./11 g of 6% alpha acids)
0.33 oz. Santiam hops (15 min.)
0.33 oz. Sterling hops (7.5 min.)
0.33 oz. Santiam hops (0 min.)
1 tsp Irish moss (15 min.)
1⁄4 tsp. yeast nutrients
Danstar Nottingham Ale yeast
1 cup corn sugar (for priming)

Step by Step
Add crushed grains and flaked maize to kettle and stir in 14.3 qts. (13.5 L) of mash liquor at 142 °F (61 °C). Mash should settle into 131 °F (55 °C). Immediately begin heating mash to ramp temperature up to 150 °F (66 °C). Stir constantly and aim to raise the temperature at a rate of 2 °F
(~1 °C) per minute. Hold for 45 minutes at 150 °F (66 °C) then heat mash — again stirring constantly — to a mash out temperature of 168 °F (76 °C). Scoop mash over to lauter tun and let sit for 5 minutes. Recirculate wort for 20 minutes (or until wort is clear) then begin running off wort. Keep sparge water heated such that grain bed temperature remains close to, but not over, 168 °F (76 °C). Collect about 5 gallons (19 L) of wort, Add 1.5 gallons (5.7 L) of water to wort and boil for 90 minutes. Add hops at times indicated in the ingredient list. Add Irish moss and yeast nutrients with 15 minutes left in boil. Cool wort to around 65 °F (18 °C) and transfer to fermenter. Aerate thoroughly and pitch yeast. Ferment at 65 °F (18 °C) until fermentation is complete (about 4–6 days). Let beer sit on yeast for a day or two, at 68–70 °F (20–21 °C), then rack directly to keg or bottling bucket.

0.33 oz. Santiam hops (0 min.)
1 tsp Irish moss (15 min.)
1⁄4 tsp. yeast nutrients
Danstar Nottingham Ale yeast
1 cup corn sugar (for priming)

Step by Step
Place crushed grains in a large steeping bag. In a large kitchen pot, heat 3.0 qts. (2.8 L) of water to 161 °F (72 °C). Submerge grain bag and let steep, at
150 °F (66 °C), for 45 minutes. While grains are steeping, heat 2.0 gallons (7.6 L) of water to a boil in your brewpot. In a small third pot, heat 1.5 quarts (1.4 L) of water to 170 °F (77 °C). Once grains are done steeping, lift out grain bag and place it in a colander suspended over your brewpot. Slowly pour the "grain tea" through the grain bag (to strain out the "floaties"), then pour the 170 °F (77 °C) water through the bag (to rinse the grains). Add dried malt extract and bring the wort to a boil, add first dose of hops and boil for 60 minutes. Add hops at times indicated in ingredient list. With 15 minutes left in the boil, stir in liquid malt extract, sugar, Irish moss and yeast nutrients. After boil, cool wort — in sink or with a wort chiller — then transfer to fermenter. (Do not pour hot wort into cold water for chilling.) Add cool water to top volume up to 5.0 gallons (19 L) and make temperature 65 °F (18 °C). Aerate thoroughly and pitch yeast. Ferment at 65 °F (18 °C) until fermentation is complete (about 4–6 days). Let beer sit on yeast for a day or two, at 68–70 °F (20–21 °C), then rack directly to keg or bottling bucket. (No secondary fermentation is required).

Redstone Meadery Vanilla Bean - Cinnamon Stick Mead Clone
Redstone Meadery's Vanilla Bean / Cinnamon Stick Mead
(5 gallon/19 L, honey and spices)
OG = 1.102 FG = 1.012
ABV = 12%

Ingredients
8 lbs. (3.6 kg) alfalfa honey
4 lbs (1.8 kg) wildflower honey
1 tbsp. yeast nutrient or 1 tbsp. extra light malt extract
3-4 whole vanilla beans
3–4 cinnamon sticks
Red Star Montrachet yeast

Step by Step
Bring 4 gallons (15 L) of water up to 180 °F (82 °C) in your kettle and then add 12 pounds (5.4 kg) of honey.

Cover for 20 to 30 minutes at around 150 to 160 °F (66–71 °C). Now is a good time to start your yeast. For mead, I like to use dry yeast. Take a few packets of Montrachet yeast. Mix with a tablespoon of extra light malt extract. Stir vigorously so as to introduce oxygen.

Primary fermentation most likely will take three to four months. Try to keep the fermentation temperature between 70 and 78 °F (21–26 °C) if possible. After primary, transfer to a 5-gallon (19 L) carboy that already has the vanilla beans and cinnamon sticks in it. Just toss the cinnamon sticks in whole. Cut the vanilla beans into thirds before adding. The vanilla beans in particular need the alcohol in the mead to help extract the flavor. Let it sit for three months or so. Transfer off the spices. Keep racking until you are pleased with the clarity of the mead. Bottle still (without bottling sugar).

Red, White and Brew Pilsner
(7.5 gallons/28 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.044 FG = 1.005
IBU = 12 SRM = 4 ABV = 5%

The recipe is brewed like a 5-gallon (19-L) batch, but after the addition of the kräusen beer and dilution water, you end up with 7.5 gallons (28 L) of beer. Your base beer (and kräusen beer) will have a gravity just over 14 °Plato (1.056) and have 16 IBUs.

Ingredients
5 lb. 14 oz. (2.7 kg) 2-row pale malt
3 lb. 14 oz. (1.8 kg) 6-row pale malt
4 lb. 2 oz. (1.9 kg) corn grits
1/4 tsp. calcium chloride (90 mins)
1 tsp. Irish moss (15 mins)
4.5 AAU Magnum hops (60 min.) (0.28 oz./8.0 g of 16% alpha acids)
0.5 AAU Saaz hops (30 mins in kräusen beer) (1/8 oz./3.5 g of 3.5 % alpha acids)
0.5 AAU Hallertau hops (30 mins in kräusen beer) (1/8 oz./3.5 g of 3.5 % alpha acids)
Wyeast 2007 (Pilsen Lager) or White Labs WLP 840 (North American Lager) yeast (3.5 qt./~3.5 L yeast starter)

Step by Step
Reserve a handful of 6-row malt. Mash in remaining barley malts by combining crushed malts with 4.5 gallons (17 L) of water at 133 °F (56 °C) in your kettle and begin mashing at 122 °F (50 °C). Combine corn grits and handful of 6-row malt with 1.5 gallons (5.7 L) of water in a large kitchen pot and begin heating cereal mash to 158 °F (70 °C). Rest cereal mash at 158 °F (70 °C) for 5 minutes, then bring to a boil. Boil for 30 minutes. (The cereal mash will need to be stirred almost constantly while being heated and boiled.)

After boiling the cereal mash for about 5 minutes, begin heating the main mash to 140 °F (60 °C) at a rate of about 2 °F (~1 °C) per minute. Hold main mash at 140 °F (60 °C), once that temperature is reached. Stir main mash while heating to prevent scorching. When cereal mash is done boiling, combine with main mash (at 140 °F/60 °C) and adjust temperature — if needed — to 153 °F (67 °C). Keep mash at 153 °F (67 °C) for 20 minutes, then begin performing an iodine test every 5 minutes.

When iodine test is negative (no color change to blue or purple), begin heating mash to 168 °F (76 °C). Transfer mash to lauter tun, let mash settle for 5 minutes, then recirculate wort for 20 minutes (or until substantially clear). Sparge with water hot enough to keep grain bed at 170 °F (77 °C ) and collect about 5 gallons (19 L) of wort, add 2.5 gallons (9.5 L) of water and bring to a rolling boil.

Once wort comes to a boil, stir in 1/4 tsp of calcium chloride and then remove 1 gallon (3.8 L) of wort and place it in a covered pot to cool. This will be your kräusen wort you will use later. Once wort cools, siphon to a 1.0-gallon (3.8 L) jug and refrigerate until needed.

Boil the remaining 6.5 gallons (25 L) of wort down to 5.0 gallons (19 L) over 90 minutes, adding single hop addition at 60 minutes left in boil. Add Irish moss with 15 minutes left in boil. Cool wort down to 48 °F (8.8 °C) and transfer wort to fermenter, leaving behind as much trub as you reasonably can. Aerate wort with a 60-second shot of oxygen and pitch all but about two tablespoons of yeast sediment from yeast starter. Refrigerate remaining yeast sediment in an air-tight container (like a White Labs yeast tube).

Ferment beer at 52 °F (11 °C). When fermentation slows greatly, prepare kräusen beer. To do this, take the 1.0 gallon (3.8 L) of wort you reserved, add the kräusen hops and boil for 30 minutes, shooting for 0.75 gallons (2.8 L) of post-boil wort. Cool kräusen wort to 52 °F (11 °C), siphon to sanitized 1.0-gallon (3.8-L) jug, aerate and pitch with remaining yeast. Let kräusen beer begin fermenting and come to high kräusen. Add kräusen beer to main batch of beer and let fermentation finish at 52 °F (11 °C).

After the fermentation is finished, separate beer from yeast and cool to 40 °F (4.4 °C). Allow to cold condition (lager) for 5–6 weeks. When you are ready to keg the beer, boil 2 gallons (7.6 L) of water down to 1.75 gallons (6.6 L) and cool rapidly. Add two-thirds of the dilution water — a little over 4.5 quarts, or 4.4 L — to a 5-gallon (19-L) Corny keg and the remaining third of the water to a second Corny keg. (Use a 3.0-gallon (11-L) keg, if you have one, for the second keg.) Transfer beer to first keg until it is full, then transfer remaining beer to second keg. Seal kegs, purge their headspaces and force carbonate to 2.6 volumes of CO2.

(Option: You can choose not to dilute the beer going to the second keg and have about 1.9 gallons (7.3 L) of strong beer or "malt liquor.")

There is a yearly Chicago Homebrew Club Competition sponsored by Bell's Brewing called Hoptacular and this took second place in 2013, but still a C.H.A.O.S. club favorite and re-brewed several times. We have done lightly rested Bourbon Barrel versions as well.

Ingredients
9.5 lbs. (4.3 kg) Best Malz Red X® malt (13 °L)
13 oz. (0.37 kg) aromatic malt (20 °L)
6.5 oz. (185 g) Briess chocolate malt (350 °L)
10.5 AAU Saphir hop (60 min.) (3 oz./85 g at 3.5% alpha acid)
3.5 AAU Saphir hops (5 min.) (1 oz./28 g at 3.5% alpha acids)
1/2 Whirlfloc® tablet (10 min.)
1/2 tsp. yeast nutrient (15 min.)
Wyeast 2308 (Munich Lager) or White Labs WLP838 (Southern German Lager) yeast
3/4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Make a yeast starter 1-3 days in advance. This is a single step infusion mash. Mix all of the crushed grains with 15 quarts (14.2 L) of 168 °F (76 °C) water to stabilize at 148 ºF (64 ºC). Mash for 60 minutes and slowly sparge with 170 ºF (77 ºC) water.

Collect approximately 6.5 gallons (24.6 L) of wort runoff. The pre-boil gravity should read 1.037 SG. Boil for 60 minutes. While boiling, add the hops and Whirlfloc® as per the schedule.

After the boil, cool the wort to 50 ºF (10 ºC) and transfer to your fermenter. Pitch the yeast and aerate the wort heavily. Ferment at 55 ºF (13 ºC). Gently transfer to a secondary vessel, avoiding any splashing to prevent aerating the beer. Allow the beer to lager at 45 ºF (7 ºC) for an additional 3-5 weeks. Prime and bottle condition or keg and force carbonate to 2.4 volumes CO2.

Step by Step
Mill the grains and dough-in targeting a mash thickness that will enable your system to achieve the necessary pre-boil volume and gravity. Hold the mash at 154 °F (68 °C) until enzymatic conversion is complete. Infuse the mash with near boiling water while stirring or with a recirculating mash system raise the temperature to mash out at 168°F (76°C). Sparge slowly with 170 °F (77 °C) water, collecting wort until the pre-boil kettle volume is around 5.9 gallons (22.3 L) and the gravity is 1.053 (13.2 °P).

The total wort boil time is 60 minutes. Add the first hop addition once the wort starts boiling. Add Irish moss or other kettle finings and the second hop addition with 15 minutes left in the boil. Add the last hop addition at flame out. Chill the wort to 67 °F (19 °C) and aerate thoroughly. The proper pitch rate is 2 packages of liquid yeast or 1 package of liquid yeast in a 2.4-liter starter.

Ferment at 67 °F (19 °C) until the yeast drops clear. At this temperature and with healthy yeast, fermentation should be complete in about one week. Allow the lees to settle and the brew to mature without pressure for another two days after fermentation appears finished. Rack to a keg and force carbonate or rack to a bottling bucket, add priming sugar, and bottle. Target a carbonation level of 2.5 volumes.

Step by Step
Back when I started brewing I used an ultra-light extract made by Alexander’s (California Concentrate Company), but any fresh, high quality light color extract will work well. If you cannot get fresh liquid malt extract, it is better to use an appropriate amount of dry malt extract (DME) instead.

Mill or coarsely crack the specialty malt and place loosely in a grain bag. Avoid packing the grains too tightly in the bag, using more bags if needed. Steep the bag in about 1.5 gallon (~6 liters) of water at 165 °F (74 °C). The idea is that your temperature, once you add the grain, is in the malt conversion range and will convert some of the starch from the Munich malt. After about 30 to 60 minutes, lift the grain bag out of the steeping liquid and rinse with warm water. Allow the bags to drip into the kettle for a few minutes while you add the malt extract. Do not squeeze the bags. Add enough water to the steeping liquor and malt extract to make a pre-boil volume of 5.9 gallons (22.3 L) and the gravity is 1.053 (13.2 °P). Stir thoroughly to help dissolve the extract and bring to a boil.

The total wort boil time is 60 minutes. Add the first hop addition once the wort starts boiling. Add Irish moss or other kettle finings and the second hop addition with 15 minutes left in the boil. Add the last hop addition at flame out. Chill the wort to 67°F (19 °C) and aerate thoroughly. The proper pitch rate is 2 packages of liquid yeast or 1 package of liquid yeast in a 2.4-liter starter.

Ferment at 67 °F (19 °C) until the yeast drops clear. At this temperature and with healthy yeast, fermentation should be complete in about one week. Allow the lees to settle and the brew to mature without pressure for another two days after fermentation appears finished. Rack to a keg and force carbonate or rack to a bottling bucket, add priming sugar, and bottle. Target a carbonation level of 2.5 volumes.

(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.063 FG = 1.015
IBU = 27 SRM = 14 ABV = 6.3%

Ingredients
13.5 lbs. (6.1 kg) Best Malz Best Munich malt
0.25 lb. (113 g) melanoidin malt2 oz. (57 g) Weyermann Carafa® Special II malt
7.5 AAU Magnum pellet hops (60 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 15% alpha acids)
White Labs WLP833 (German Bock) or Wyeast 2206 (Bavarian Lager) or SafLager S-189 yeast
3⁄4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
This is a single infusion mash. Heat 20.8 qts. (19.7 L) of water, add 1 tsp. of calcium chloride. Mash grains for 60 minutes at 155 °F (68 °C). Sparge with enough water to collect 6.5 gallons (25 L) of wort in the kettle. Bring wort to a boil and boil for 60 minutes, add hops according to the recipe above. Add a kettle coagulant of your choice if you so desire.

After the boil is complete, give the wort a long stir to create a whirlpool and let settle for 10 minutes, then begin to chill. Bring down to yeast-pitching temperature, aerate the wort, and pitch the yeast. Ferment between 48–56 °F (9–14 °C). Ferment for 2 weeks at this temperature then raise temperature to low 70s °F (21–22 °C) and hold for 2 days. Transfer to a secondary and lager for 1–4 weeks at 33–35 °F (0–2 °C). Bottle or force carbonate per normal.

Extract brewers: Swap out the Munich malt with 6.8 lbs. (3.1 kg) of Munich dried malt extract. Soak the crushed melanoidin and Carafa® in a small grain bag as the water heats up to a boil. Off heat, stir in the extract just prior to hitting a boil and stir until fully dissolved. Follow the remaining instructions from the all-grain recipe.

This upstate New York Oktoberfest is a traditional Marzen style beer. It features biscuit, caramel, and toffee notes.

Ingredients
5 lbs. (2.3 kg) Pilsner malt
2.5 lbs. (1.1 kg) light Munich malt (9 °L)
1.75 lbs. (0.8 kg) dark Munich malt (20 °L)
1.25 lbs. (0.57 kg) Caramunich® I malt
0.75 lb. (0.34 kg) biscuit malt
7 AAU Perle hops (60 min.) (1 oz./28 g at 7% alpha acids)
1⁄2 tsp. Irish moss
White Labs WLP830 (German Lager) or Wyeast 2124 (Bohemian Lager) yeast
3⁄4 cup (150 g) dextrose (if priming)

Step by Step
Mill the grains and mix with 3.5 gallons (13.3 L) of 164 °F (73 °C) strike water to reach a mash temperature of 152 °F (67 °C). Hold this temperature for 60 minutes. Vorlauf until your runnings are clear. Sparge the grains with 3.8 gallons (14.4 L) of water at 170 °F (77 °C) and top up as necessary to obtain 6 gallons (23 L) of wort. Boil for 60 minutes, adding hops according to the ingredient list and Irish moss if desired. After the boil, chill the wort 55 °F (13 °C). Aerate the wort with pure oxygen or filtered air and pitch yeast. Ferment at 55 °F (13 °C) until fermentation is complete (about 1.014 specific gravity); you may want to increase temperature by a few degrees at the latter stages of fermentation to aid in diacetyl cleanup. Once the beer completes fermentation, bottle or keg and carbonate to approximately 2.5 volumes. You may want to cold-crash the beer prior to packaging to 35 °F (2 °C) for 48 hours to improve clarity. Store carbonated beer at near-freezing temperatures for at least four weeks before drinking.

Partial mash option:
Reduce the light Munich malt in the all-grain recipe to 2 lbs. (0.91 kg) and replace the dark Munich and Pilsner malts with 3 lbs. (1.4 kg) Pilsner liquid malt extract and 1.9 lbs. (0.86 kg) Munich liquid malt extract. Place crushed grains in one or more grain bags. Bring 6 qts. (5.7 L) of water to approximately 164 °F (73 °C) and mix grains into the water. Temperature should stabilize around 152 °F (67 °C). Hold for 60 minutes at this temperature. Remove the grain bags, place them in a colander and wash with 6 qts. (5.7 L) hot water then let drain fully. Add liquid extract while stirring, and stir until completely dissolved. Top off to 6 gallons (23 L) then bring the wort to a boil. Follow the remaining portion of the all-grain recipe.

"For our first release of Bits and Bobs in 2018 — our seasonal rotating IPA — we used Strata®, Citra®, and Azacca® as the primary hops. The idea with this specific beer release is that every spring we have a new recipe using the malts and hops we had grown to love over the prior year. It's the perfect excuse to be continually trying new hops, working with hop farms, and working on new hop blends. For the first release, we had a nice clean malt profile to let the hops shine through and take center stage." — Adam Robbings Brewmaster, Reuben’s Brews

Ingredients
11.5 lbs. (5.2 kg) pale malt
1.7 lbs. (0.77 kg) Vienna malt
0.6 lb. (0.27 kg) Carapils® malt

Step by step
Crush the malt and add to 4.3 gallons (16.3 L) strike water to achieve a stable mash temperature at 152 °F (67 °C). Hold at this temperature until enzymatic conversion is complete. Sparge slowly with 168 °F (76 °C) water, collecting wort until the pre-boil kettle volume is 6.5 gallons (24.6 L).

Boil the wort for 60 minutes, adding the hops as indicated. After the boil is finished, turn off the heat and add the 0-minute hop-stand additions. Stir the wort to create a whirlpool, then let settle for 10 minutes before chilling the wort down to yeast-pitching temperature. Now transfer to the fermenter, aerate the wort, and pitch the yeast. Ferment at 66–68 °F (19–20 °C).

As the kräusen begins to fall, typically day four or five, add the dry hops to the fermenter and let the beer sit on the hops for four days. Bottle with priming sugar or keg and force carbonate to 2.4 volumes CO2.

Revolution Brewing in Chicago, Illinois decided to brew up a supposed "Zero IBU" IPA on their brewpub system. Using a whooping 5.5 lbs. (2.5 kg) of hops per barrel, it was a hop bomb, but should not technically have any "IBUs" based on isomerized alpha acids. What they found out was that according to lab analysis, there were still 58 IBUs in solution of the finished beer, derived from other compounds.

Ingredients
12.9 lbs. (5.85 kg) 2-row pale malt
1.25 lbs. (567 g) red wheat malt
0.9 lb. (408 g) light Munich malt (6 °L)
2.5 oz. (71 g) Amarillo® hops (hopstand)
2.5 oz. (71 g) Centennial hops (hopstand)
2.5 oz. (71 g) Amarillo® hops (1st round - dry hop)
2.5 oz. (71 g) Centennial hops (1st round - dry hop)
5 oz. (142 g) Mosaic® hops (2nd round - dry hop)
Wyeast 1028 (London Ale) or White Labs WLP013 (London Ale) or Lallemand Nottingham yeast
3⁄4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step

This recipe is designed to achieve 5.5 gallons (21 L) wort in the fermenter on brew day. This will help offset the loss of volume to the heavy hopping rate of this beer. Mill the grains and mix with 5 gallons (19 L) of soft water at 163 °F (73 °C) to reach a mash temperature of 150 °F (66 °C). Hold this temperature for 60 minutes. Vorlauf until your runnings are clear. Sparge with enough water to obtain 7 gallons (25 L) of wort. You may want to add a pinch of hops or an additive like Fermcap to help with foam control.

After the boil, turn off heat and chill wort to 165 °F (74 °C) then begin a whirlpool of the wort and add the hopstand hops. Let settle for 30 minutes, then chill the wort to 66 °F (19 °C). The aim is to have 5.5 gallons (21 L) of wort in your fermenter. Aerate and pitch yeast. Ferment at 68 °F (20 °C) for 7 days. Add the first round of dry hops and wait for three days. Carefully rack the beer off the first round of hops, hopefully in a closed transfer situation into a CO2-purged receiving vessel. Bag the second round of hops and add to the fermenter. Wait 2-3 days then remove. Carbonate to approximately 2.5 volumes. You can cold-crash the beer prior to packaging to 35 °F (2 °C) for 48 hours to improve clarity.

Bittering Hops:

I asked Revolution Brewing’s Brewer John Palos about his thoughts on the traditional bittering charge of hops with these hop-forward beers and whether they are becoming obsolete. He replied, "They’re definitely not a thing of the past. In fact, I feel that with growing development of (non pellet) hop products, many of which are boil-only, we will see growing interest in boil additions. I do see increasingly a simplification of hop bills, which I think is a positive. Some of the best beers I’ve had are made with stunningly simple recipes. The days of the IPAs with 6 different malts (including 10% crystal) are in the past, and I think 3+ hop additions are also disappearing. However, that bittering charge is still invaluable in many hoppy beers. I feel like it imparts a more stable, tangible, chewy bitterness that will last longer in packaged beer.

Ingredients
3.0 lbs. (1.4 kg) Vienna malt
8.0 oz. (0.23 kg) CaraMunich® Type II malt (45 °L)
5.0 oz. (0.14 kg) aromatic malt
3.0 oz. (85 g) special B malt
1.25 lbs. (0.57 kg) wheat dried malt extract
3.3 lbs. (1.5 kg) light liquid malt extract
4 AAU Mt. Hood hops (60 min.) (1.o oz./28 g of 5%alpha acids)

Step by Step
Heat 5.5 qts. (5.2 L) of water to 165 °F (74 °C) and pour into a 2-gallon (7.6-L) beverage cooler. Place crushed grains in a nylon steeping bag (or disposable paint strainer) and slowly submerge grains in hot water. Use a large brewing spoon to stir grains and water thoroughly. Mash, starting at 154 °F (68 °C), for 45 minutes. (The temperature will drop — perhaps as low as 149 °F (65 °C) — over this time period. This is fine.) Note the liquid level in the cooler. Towards the end of the mash period, heat 0.5 gallon (1.9 L) of water to a boil in your brewpot. In addition, in a large soup pot, heat
5.5 qts. (5.2 L) of water to 180 °F (82 °C).

When the mash is finished, recirculate 3.0 qts. (2.8 L) of wort, then run off all of the wort. Add wort to the boiling water in your brewpot. Add 180 °F (82 °C) water to cooler until liquid is at the previous level. Stir grains, let them sit for 5 minutes, then recirculate and run off the second wort.

Bring the wort — about 3.0 gallons (11 L) total — to a boil. Upon boiling, turn off the heat and stir in the wheat dried malt extract. Resume heating and return the wort to a boil. Add Mt. Hood hops and boil for 60 minutes.

With 15 minutes remaining in the boil, stir in liquid malt extract. (Stir well to avoid scorching.) After boil, cool brewpot in sink (or with wort chiller) until side of brewpot is cool to the touch. Transfer wort to bucket fermenter and add cool water to make 5 gallons (19 L). Aerate wort and pitch dried yeast. Let ferment at 70 °F (21 °C).

When primary fermentation slows, open bucket and pitch Lactobacillus and Pediococcus cultures. Let beer condition, in the primary bucket, for 3–4 months at 70–80 °F (21–27 °C).

After this period, add Brettanomyces culture and oak cubes, then rack beer to a glass carboy. (Soak oak cubes in beer for 2 weeks prior to adding them. If you happen to have some wine that has turned to vinegar, add a few drops to the soaking beer.) Age for another 6–9 months at 60–70 °F (16–21 °C), then keg and carbonate the beer.

2 lbs. (0.91 kg) German Munich I malt
4 oz. (113 g) Carafoam® malt
4.1 AAU Magnum hops (first wort hop) (0.33 oz./9 g at 12.4% alpha acids)
27 AAU Citra® hops (15 min.) (2.25 oz./64 g at 12% alpha acids)
2.25 oz. (64 g) Citra® hops (0 min.)
2 oz. (57 g) Citra® hops (dry hop)
5 g (1 tsp.) gelatin fining (secondary)
Wyeast 1469 (West Yorkshire) or White Labs WLP037 (Yorkshire Square Ale) or Lallemand Windsor Ale yeast
3⁄4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step

This recipe uses reverse osmosis (RO) water. Prepare 33 qts. (31 L) of water with 5 g of calcium chloride and 5 g of calcium sulfate (brew in a bag; if using a standard mash, put the water salts in the mash).

This recipe uses a step mash. Mash in the malts at 125 °F (52 °C) and hold this temperature for 10 minutes. Raise mash temperature to 145 °F (63 °C) and hold for 30 minutes. Raise mash temperature to 162 °F (72 °C) and hold for 30 minutes. Raise to 172 °F (78 °C) and hold for 10 minutes. Remove grain from mash (brew in a bag) or sparge with 168 °F (76 °C) water until 6.5 gallons (25 L) of wort is collected. Add the first wort hops (FWH) and bring wort up to a boil.

Boil the wort for 60 minutes, adding the hops at times indicated in the recipe. When the boil is complete, chill to 61 °F (16 °C). Pitch yeast into oxygenated wort. Allow fermentation to passively warm to 68 °F (10 °C) until fermentation is almost complete. Transfer to secondary with the dry hops already in the container. After fermentation has finished, cold crash to 32 °F (0 °C), then add 5 g of gelatin mixed with water. Keg condition for 7–14 days at 68 to 72 °F (20 to 22 °C). Prime and bottle condition, or keg and force carbonate.

Mill the grains and dough-in targeting a mash of around 1.5 quarts of water to 1 pound of grain (a liquor-to-grist ratio of about 3:1 by weight) and a temperature of 154 °F (68 °C). Hold the mash at 154 °F (68 °C) until enzymatic conversion is complete. Infuse the mash with near boiling water while stirring or with a recirculating mash system raise the temperature to mash out at 168 °F (76 °C). Sparge slowly with 170 °F (77 °C) water, collecting wort until the pre-boil kettle volume is around 6.5 gallons (24.6 L) and the gravity is 1.038 (9.4 °P).

The total wort boil time is 90 minutes. Add the bittering hops with 60 minutes left in the boil. Add Irish moss or other kettle finings with 15 minutes left in the boil. Chill rapidly to 65 °F (18 °C), let the break material settle, rack to the fermenter, pitch the yeast and aerate thoroughly.

Use 10 grams of properly rehydrated dry yeast, 2 liquid yeast packages, or make an appropriate starter. Ferment at 65 °F (18 °C). When initial fermentation slows, add apricot puree to a second fermenter and carefully rack the beer onto the fruit. Fermentation should pick up again as the yeast consumes the fructose in the fruit puree. Once fermentation finishes, carbonate to approximately 2.5 to 3 volumes.

Extract with Grains Option:
Replace the American two-row and wheat malt with 6.6 lb. (3.0 kg) of liquid wheat extract. Mill or coarsely crack the specialty malts. Mix them well and place loosely in a grain bag. Steep the bag in 1⁄2 gallon (~2 liters) of 170 °F (77 °C) water for about 30 minutes. Lift the grain bag out of the steeping liquid and rinse with warm water. Let the bag drip into the kettle while you add the extract. Do not squeeze the bags. Add enough water to the steeping liquor and malt extract to make a pre-boil kettle volume around 6.5 gallons (24.4 L) and the gravity is 1.038 (9.4 °P). Follow the remaining instructions for the all-grain recipe.

13.7 oz. (388 g) Briess Midnight Wheat malt
11.4 oz. (323 g) crystal malt (45 °L)
4.6 oz. (130 g) flaked oats
14 AAU Summit™ hops (60 min.) (0.78 oz./22 g at 14.2% alpha acids)
8.5 AAU Simcoe® hops (30 min.) (0.68 oz./19 g at 12.3% alpha acids)
14 AAU Summit™ hops (15 min.) (0.25 oz./7 g at 14.2% alpha acids)
0.78 oz. (22 g) Simcoe® hops (0 min.)
1.28 oz. (36 g) Simcoe® hops (dry hop)
White Labs WLP001 (California Ale) or Wyeast 1056 (American Ale) or Safale US-05 yeast
3⁄4 cup (150 g) dextrose (if priming)

Step by Step
This is a single step infusion mash. Mix the crushed grains with 4 gallons (15.1 L) of water at 162 °F (72 °C), stabilizing at 151 °F (66 °C) for 60 minutes. Raise the temperature of the mash to 168 °F (76 °C) and begin to lauter. Collect 6.5 gallons (24.6 L) of wort to begin your 60-minute boil, adding hops at times indicated. After the boil is complete, rapidly chill your wort to 68 °F (20 °C) for fermenting, aerate the wort well, then pitch the yeast. Dry hop after primary fermentation is complete. Wait 3–5 days then transfer the beer to a bottling bucket for priming and bottling, or transfer to a keg. Carbonate to approximately 2 volumes.

Extract with grains option:
Substitute the 2-row pale malt and flaked oats in the all-grain recipe with 5.75 lbs. (2.6 kg) extra light dried malt extract. Steep crushed grains in 3 gallons (11.3 L) of 150–160 °F (66–71 °C) water for 20 minutes, stirring the grain just prior to removing. Remove the grain from the hot water with a strainer, then wash the grains with 1 gallon (4 L) hot water. Bring wort to a boil and add dried malt extract. Follow the remaining portion of the all-grain recipe.

(5 gallons/19 L, partial mash)
OG = 1.060 FG = 1.012
IBU = 38 SRM = 8 ABV = 6.3%

Riveter Rye was created by Maryland Homebrew’s Owner Chris Anderson. She loves a good pale ale and IPA (among other styles). This beer has a little of both worlds. A little stronger than your typical pale ale and not as hoppy as some IPAs, this is an easy-drinking brew that’s great for the summer. The malt and hops are balanced and full of flavor with some crisp and complex flavors coming from the rye malt. Rye also tends to make the beer finish out a little drier — perfect for the hot days. The classic hops Riveter Rye uses will please all palates.

Riveter Rye Pale Ale is named for Rosie the Riveter and has been brewed several times for the Baltimore Beer Babes, a club co-founded by Chris. This beer can be found on Untappd.

Ingredients
8 lbs. (3.6 kg) Briess Pilsen light liquid malt extract
0.75 lb. (0.34 kg) Caramunich malt (60 °L)
1.5 lbs. (0.68 kg) rye malt
6.75 AAU Magnum hops (first wort hop) (0.5 oz./14 g at 13.5% alpha acids)
2 AAU Perle hops (30 min.) (0.25 oz./7 g at 8% alpha acids)
3.75 AAU Cascade hops (15 min.) (0.75 oz./21 g at 5% alpha acids)
3.75 AAU Cascade hops (7 min.) (0.75 oz./21 g at 5% alpha acids)
1 oz. (28 g) Cascade hops (dry hop)
1⁄2 teaspoon Irish moss (15 min.)
White Labs WLP001 (California Ale) or Wyeast 1056 (American Ale) or Safale US-05 yeast
3⁄4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by step
Steep grains in bag in 2.5 gallons (9.5 L) of water at 155 °F (68 °C) for 30 minutes. Remove grains and allow to drip back into kettle. Bring wort up to a boil and then remove kettle from the burner. Add the malt extract while stirring and first wort hops, be careful not to scorch the extract to the bottom of the kettle. Return kettle to burner and boil for 60 minutes, adding hops and Irish moss as indicated.

When the boil is complete, chill wort to get below 75–80 °F (24–28 °C). Transfer to fermenter and add water to make 5.25 gallons (20 L). Aerate and pitch yeast when wort temperature is between 70–75 °F (21–24 °C). If using one-step fermentation, allow the wort to sit in the fermenter at 65–70 °F (18–21 °C) for about 7 days, then use a sanitized hydrometer to ensure that it has reached final gravity. If using two-step fermentation, rack to a secondary fermenter (glass carboy) after five days and allow it to sit for another week, along with dry hops, before bottling. Dry hops should be added in the last week of fermentation during the clearing stage.

Step by Step
Place the crushed grains in a muslin bag and steep in the brewing water as it heats up. Remove the grain bag when the temperature reaches 168 °F (75 °C). Add the liquid and dried malt extracts and bring to a boil. Boil the wort for 60 minutes adding the hops at the times indicated in the ingredients list.

After the boil, turn off the heat and chill the wort to about 69 °F (21 °C), transfer the wort to the fermenter, aerate, and pitch the yeast. Allow the fermentation temperature to free-rise up to 78 °F (26 °C), ferment for 10 days and add the peach and apricot purée. Ferment for an additional 7 days, rack to a secondary fermenter for additional clearing if desired, and then bottle or keg the beer and carbonate.

Tips for Success:
Roadhouse Brewing Co. utilizes White Labs WLP566 (Saison II) yeast in this beer because they love the fruitiness and subtle tartness it creates in their beer. It also produces a velvety characteristic, which gives it a unique mouthfeel. They are able to coax this profile out of the yeast by giving it a longer primary ferment and allowing the temperature to free-rise up to 78 °F (25 °C). It is important that this yeast be allowed to do its work and reach the proper terminal gravity as an under attenuated saison will not have the proper flavor profile.

Because of the long fermentation period required, and the sometimes fickle nature of saison yeast, it’s not a bad idea to pitch the yeast as a yeast starter to ensure a good, healthy population of cells. Try using a 0.5 gallon (~2 L) starter for a 5-gallon (19-L) batch. Aerate the wort well, and even consider using a pure oxygen setup in the fermenter to be cautious.

Regarding the "additional cellaring" as referenced in the recipes, BYO author Horst Dornbusch recommends, laying a saison down for three months of bottle-conditioning and maturation at a room temperature of 73 °F (23 °C). He adds, "However, serve the brew at a cool cellar temperature of roughly 50–55 °F (10–13 °C)."

Step by Step
This recipe is designed to achieve 5.5 gallons (21 L) wort in the fermenter on brew day. This will help offset the loss of volume to the heavy hopping rate of this beer. Build your water profile to achieve a 300:150 PPM sulfate:chloride profile. Mill the grains and mix with 5 gallons (19 L) of 167 °F (71 °C) strike water to reach a mash temperature of 155 °F (68 °C), targeting a mash pH of 5.2. Hold this temperature for 60 minutes. Vorlauf until your runnings are clear. Sparge with enough water to obtain 7 gallons (25 L) of wort and add the first wort hops while the sparge is ongoing. Boil for 60 minutes, adding hops according to the ingredients list. After the boil, turn off heat and begin a whirlpool of the hot wort. Let stand for 20 minutes, then chill the wort to 65 °F (18 °C). There should be 5.5 gallons (21 L) of wort in your kettle. Aerate with pure oxygen or filtered air and pitch yeast.

Ferment at 67 °F (19 °C) for 7 days. Add the dry hops and raise to 72 °F (22 °C) for three more days. Once the beer reaches terminal gravity, bottle or keg and carbonate to approximately 2.5 volumes. You can cold-crash the beer prior to packaging to 35 °F (2 °C) for 48 hours to improve clarity.

Partial mash option:
Substitute the 2-row pale malt in the all-grain recipe with 9 lbs. (4.1 kg) extra light liquid malt extract. Bring 1 gallon (4 L) of water to approximately 155 °F (68 °C) and hold there. Place the milled grains in grain bags and steep for 45 minutes. Remove the grain bags, and place in a colander. Wash the grains with 1 gallon (4 L) hot water. Add liquid extract while stirring, and stir until dissolved, then top off to 7 gallons (26.5 L). Boil for 60 minutes. Follow the remaining portion of the all-grain recipe.

This is an American-style barleywine first brewed by Rock Art Brewery (Morrisville, Vermont) as its 10th anniversary beer and soon made into a regular offering. The malts contribute a caramel note and hide the taste of the alcohol.

Ingredients

17 lbs. (6.8 kg) 2-row pale malt
8 oz. (227 g) crystal malt (120 °L)
5 oz. (142 g) chocolate malt
3 oz. (85 g) black malt
1 lb. (0.45 g) flaked barley
1 lb. (0.45 kg) rice hulls
1/2 tsp. yeast nutrients (10 min.)
7 AAU Magnum hops (60 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 14% alpha acids)
7.5 AAU Columbus hops (45 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 15% alpha acids)
15.8 AAU Cascade hops (15 min.) (2.75 oz./78 gat 5.75% alpha acids)
3 oz. (85 g) Challenger hops (3 min.)
2.5 oz. (71 g) Liberty hops (3 min.)
0.75 oz. (21 g) Cascade hops (3 min.)
Wyeast 1272 (American Ale II) or White Labs WLP051 (California Ale V) or Mangrove Jack’s M36 (Liberty Bell Ale) yeast
2/3 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
This is a single infusion mash, targeting about 1.25 qts./lb. (2.6 L/kg) water to grain mash ratio. Keeping mash pH between 5.2–5.6, mash at 154 °F (68 °C) for 60 minutes. Sparge with just enough water (~14 qts./13.2 L) to keep your wort concentrated. This should yield roughly 6.6 gallons (25 L) of 1.071 SG wort in your kettle. Boil roughly 90 minutes, with the goal to have 5.25 gallons (20 L) in your kettle at the end of the boil. Add hops at times indicated. After the boil is complete, cool, aerate, and pitch double the usual amount of yeast cells. Ferment at 68 °F (20 °C). Carbonate to 2.4 volumes CO2. Enjoy fresh if you like a bigger hop character or age for less hop profile and more malt, make sure to save a few bottles and age 12 months or more.

7 AAU Magnum hops (60 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 14% alpha acids)
7.5 AAU Columbus hops (45 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 15% alpha acids)
15.8 AAU Cascade hops (15 min.) (2.75 oz./78 gat 5.75% alpha acids)
3 oz. (85 g) Challenger hops (3 min.)
2.5 oz. (71 g) Liberty hops (3 min.)
0.75 oz. (21 g) Cascade hops (3 min.)
Wyeast 1272 (American Ale II) or White Labs WLP051 (California Ale V) or Mangrove Jack’s M36 (Liberty Bell Ale) yeast
2/3 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Place crushed grains in a muslin bag. Since these grains do not need to be mashed, raising to a precise temperature is not all that important. Heating it to about 168 °F (76 °C) will extract the sugars without pulling additional tannins and get you closer to your boil temperature quicker. Steep the grains for 10–15 minutes. Drain well and remove grain bag. Top off the kettle to 6 gallons (25 L) and raise to a boil. As soon as reaching a boil, remove kettle from heat and stir in the liquid malt extract. Boil for 60 minutes. Add hop additions as indicated. Chill to 66–68 °F (19–20 °C), aerate, and pitch yeast. Ferment at 66–68 °F (19–20°C). Carbonate to 2.4 volumes.

Rockford Brewing Co.’s Rockford Country Ale clone
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.058  FG = 1.007
IBU = 28  SRM = 7  ABV = 6.8%

This unfiltered French farmhouse-style ale features a copper color and the yeast lends estery notes of pear and apricot.

Ingredients
9.5 lbs. (4.3 kg) 2-row pale malt
9 oz. (0.25 kg) Munich malt
6 oz. (0.17 kg) white wheat malt
4 oz. (0.11 kg) Caravienne malt (20 °L)
4 oz. (0.11 kg) Victory® malt
3 oz. (85 g) Carapils® malt
9.2 oz. (0.26 kg) beet sugar (10 min.)
5.33 AAU Brewers Gold hop pellets (60 min.) (0.75 oz./21 g at 7.1% alpha acids)
2 AAU Hallertau hop pellets (30 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 4% alpha acids)
1 AAU Hallertau hop pellets (10 min.) (0.25 oz./7 g at 4% alpha acids)
1⁄2 tsp. Irish moss (30 min.)
1⁄2 tsp. yeast nutrient (15 min.)
White Labs WLP566 (Belgian Saison II) or Wyeast 3711 (French Saison) or Lallemand Belle Saison yeast
3⁄4 cup (133 g) of dextrose (if priming)

Step by Step
This is a single step infusion mash. Mix all of the crushed grains with 4.9 gallons (18.5 L) of 168 °F (76 °C) water to stabilize at 148 °F (64 °C). This is a medium-thin mash using 1.4 quarts (1.3 L) of strike water per pound of grain. This is designed to help achieve maximum fermentability. Mash for 60 minutes then slowly sparge with 175 °F (79 ºC) water.

Collect approximately 6.2 gallons (23.5 L) of wort runoff to boil for 60 minutes. While boiling, add the hops, Irish moss and yeast nutrient and beet sugar as per the schedule.

Cool the wort to 75 °F (24 °C) and transfer to your fermenter. Pitch the yeast and aerate the wort heavily. Allow the beer to cool to 66 °F (19 °C). Hold at that temperature until fermentation is complete. This may take 10–14 days. Gently transfer to a carboy, avoiding any splashing to prevent aerating the beer. Allow the beer to condition for an additional week. Prime and bottle condition or keg and force carbonate to 2.7 volumes CO2. Allow the beer to age for two more weeks to fully develop the flavors.

Partial Mash Option:
Scale the 2-row pale malt down to 1 lb. (0.45 oz.), and add 3.3 lbs. (1.5 kg) Briess light, unhopped malt extract and 2 lbs. (0.9 kg) light, dried malt extract. Steep the milled grain in 2.5 gallons (9.5 L) of water at 148 °F (64 °C) for 30 minutes. Remove grains from the wort and rinse with 2 quarts (2 L) of hot water. Add the malt extracts and boil for 60 minutes. While boiling, add the hops, Irish moss, yeast nutrient and beet sugar as per the schedule. When the boil is complete add the wort to 2 gallons (7.6 L) of cold water in the sanitized fermenter and top up to 5 gallons (19 L). Cool the wort to 75 °F (24 °C). Pitch your yeast and aerate the wort heavily. Follow the remainder of the all-grain recipe.

1 cinnamon stick
1/8 tsp. (about 1/2 g) ground cloves
2 tsp. (10 g) fresh grated orange zest
2 large oranges, juiced
8 Celestial Seasonings Red Zinger tea bags
1 tsp. (5 g) pectic enzyme
1 tsp. (5 g) acid blend
1-1/2 cups (360 mL) orange juice
1 tsp. (5 grams) yeast nutrient
1 pkg. Montrachet yeast (5 to 7 g)
1/4 tsp. (1 g) grape tannin

Step by Step

Cool and transfer to a two-gallon plastic container. Add the acid, the pectic enzyme and water to make a gallon. Add the campden tablet and let the mixture sit, well-covered, for 24 hours.

Make a yeast starter culture by combining the yeast and yeast nutrient with the tepid orange juice. Cover, shake vigorously and let stand until bubbly (1 to 3 hours), then add to the must.

Add the tannin. Allow to ferment. Rack after the most vigorous fermentation into a one gallon, airlocked fermenter. Rack into another airlocked fermenter in 3 months and again in 6 months. Rack again just before bottling, about a year after fermentation started. Bottle and cork and store for 6 months in a cool cellar.

Rogue Ales Shakespeare Stout clone
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.061 (15 °P) FG = 1.015 (3.8 °P)
IBU = 76 SRM = 48 ABV = 6.1%

Rogue's Shakespeare Stout is a classic example of the style. Rogue describes it as, "Ebony in color with a rich creamy head, earthy flavor and a mellow, chocolate finish."

Ingredients
9.12 lb. (4.14 kg) Great Western domestic pale malt (2 °L) (or similar)
1.45 lb. (660 g) Briess chocolate malt (350 °L) (or similar)
1.45 lb. (660 g) Great Western crystal malt (150 °L) (or similar)
1.34 lb. (610 g) Great Western flaked oats (2 °L) (or similar)
3.17 oz. (90 g) Briess black barley (500 °L) (or similar)
14.4 AAU Cascade pellet hops (60 min.) (2.25 oz./64 g of 6.4% alpha acids)
7.2 AAU Cascade pellet hops (15 min.) (1.13 oz./32 g of 6.4% alpha acids)
Wyeast 1764 (Rogue Pacman) yeast

Step by step
Mill the grains and dough-in. Hold the mash at 148 °F (64 °C) until enzymatic conversion is complete. Infuse the mash with near boiling water while stirring or with a recirculating mash system raise the temperature to mash out at 168 °F (76 °C). Sparge with 170 °F (77 °C) water, collecting wort until the pre-boil kettle volume is around 6.5 gallons (25 L) and the gravity is 1.047 (11.7 °P).

The total wort boil time is 90 minutes. Add the hops according to the ingredients list. Chill the wort to 60 °F (16 °C) and aerate thoroughly. The proper pitch rate is two packages of liquid yeast or one package of liquid yeast in a 2-liter starter.

Pacman ferments well at cold temperatures, but you can let it warm a little as fermentation progresses to ensure complete attenuation. Pitch at 60 °F (16 °C) and ferment until the yeast drops clear. Allow the lees to settle and the brew to mature without pressure for another two days after fermentation appears finished. Rack to a keg or bottle. Target a carbonation level of 2.5 volumes.

9.75 AAU Citra® hops (0 min.) (0.75 oz./21 g at 13% alpha acids)
7.2 AAU Amarillo® hops (hopstand) (0.8 oz./22 g at 9% alpha acids)
13.75 AAU Mosaic® hops (hopstand) (1.25 oz./35 g at 11% alpha acids)
18.2 AAU Citra® hops (hopstand) (1.4 oz./ 40 g at 13% alpha acids)
SafAle US-05 or Wyeast 1056 (American Ale) or White Labs WLP001 (California Ale) yeast
¾ cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Mill the grains, then mix with 3.75 gallons (14.2 L) of 169 °F (76 °C) strike water to achieve a single infusion rest temperature of 154 °F (68 °C). Hold at this temperature for 40 minutes. Mashout to 170 °F (77 °C) if desired.

Vorlauf until your runnings are clear before directing them to your boil kettle. Batch or fly sparge the mash with enough water to obtain 6.5 gallons (25 L) of wort. Boil for 90 minutes, adding hops at the times left in the boil indicated above. At 20 minutes left in boil, add the dextrose first and then at 10 minutes left, you should add a kettle fining agent such as Irish moss or Whirlfloc.

After the boil, add the flameout hops indicated and whirlpool for 20 minutes. Chill to 180 °F (82 °C), then add the hopstand hops and whirlpool another 20 minutes before rapidly chilling the wort to 64 °F (18 °C). Pitch yeast. Maintain fermentation temperature of 68 °F (20 °C) for this beer.

Once primary fermentation is complete, and the beer has settled, bottle or keg the beer and carbonate to approximately 2.5 volumes. A fermenter fining agent would be recommended to get the beer bright if the yeast is taking its time falling. Biofine, PVPP, or gelatin would be recommended here.

Follow the all-grain instructions for the packaging steps.

Tips for Success:
For a West Coast American IPA you should be shooting for water that contains more sulfates than chlorides in roughly a 1.5:1 ratio. I’ve found that increasing this ratio past 2:1 can result in harsher hop bitterness that contains a flinty edge. Root Down uses a quality municipal water source that’s fairly neutral; all that’s required for them is a slow filtration through a carbon filter to remove chloramines and then the addition of gypsum to their brewing liquor at a rate of 1 kg per 15-BBL batch (~2.2 grams/5 gallons). As this is a hop-forward beer, try to use the freshest hops possible. Significant degradation will hold this beer back from being the bright hop palate that it should be.

Rosemary IPA
I have an alter ego, a secret identity, in short a day job. I’m a high-school French teacher. Pretty mundane, sometimes, but that’s one of the reasons I make my own beer. It’s also one of the reasons I am able to make my own beer — time. A teacher’s schedule is wonderful.

I have had time to read some wonderful French literature, too. One book I enjoyed was Marcel Proust’s A La Recherche du Temps Perdu (Remembrance of Things Past).

What does this have to do with homebrewing? Not much. Except that one of the few things that many people know about Proust’s multi-volume opus is the scene where he explains how a taste or an odor can trigger memories of events, people, and scenes. He’s eating a madeleine (a bland French cookie), and it launches him into narrating his coming of age, his life in society, his loves, and his losses.

The same thing happens to me with beer. Certain beers are associated in my mind with certain periods of my life, with people, with places. Other tastes and aromas, outside of beer, work as well, of course, but they don’t fit as neatly into a column about homebrewing. Except this one: rosemary.

My wife and I have tried several times to grow rosemary. We buy a healthy young plant and plop it in the ground. It grows all summer, triples in size, but then dies back to nothing and never comes back the next spring. Every year we say that we’ll mulch it differently and take better care of it, but every year we have to buy a new one. We’ve also tried to keep it inside, but our house is either too humid or too dry. We’re not sure which. The thing is, the smell (and taste) of rosemary is one of those amazing memory joggers for me. The stuff grows wild in Mediterranean climates. In Provence, in the south of France, it grows taller than people. Every time I smell rosemary or eat something cooked with it, I am transported to a hillside overlooking the Riviera.

I wondered if it would work as an adjunct in brewing. It’s not too far removed from spruce and pine aromas (which are sometimes used in beer). So I bought another rosemary plant, grew it all summer, and then cut it and dried it and brewed a rich amber ale to celebrate the harvest. I used my dried, homegrown rosemary as a flavoring hop and then dry hopped with it in the secondary to boost the aroma. And the rest is (literary) history.

IBU = 60 SRM = 8 ABV = 7.7%

Ingredients
13 lbs. 9 oz. (6.15 kg) US 2-row pale malt
11 oz. (0.31 kg) Vienna malt
5 oz. (0.14 kg) crystal malt (30 °L)
14 AAU Magnum hops (60 min.) (1 oz./28 g at 14% alpha acids)
3.8 AAU Centennial hops (15 min.) (0.38 oz./11 g at 10% alpha acids)
3.75 AAU Cascade hops (5 min.) (0.75 oz./21 g at 5% alpha acids)
0.75 oz. (21 g) Cascade hops (dry hop)
0.5 oz. (14 g) Amarillo® hops (dry hop)
1 tsp. Irish moss (15 min.)
1⁄2 tsp. calcium chloride (optional)
Wyeast 1056 (American Ale), White Labs WLP001 (California Ale), or Safale US-05 yeast (3 qt./~3 L yeast starter)
3⁄4 cups corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Prepare 12 gallons (45 L) of brewing liquor with bicarbonate below 50 ppm and calcium around 75 ppm. (Adding 3.5 tsp. of gypsum to 12 gallons/45 L of soft water will get you there.) Add a Campden tablet the night before you brew to get rid of chlorine compounds. Mash grains at 152 °F (67 °C) in 18 qts. (17 L) of water. Rest for 60 minutes, then mash out to 168 °F (76 °C). Recirculate wort for 20 minutes, then collect around 7 gallons (26 L) of wort in your kettle. Keep your sparge water hot enough that the grain bed temperature remains at 168 °F (76 °C). Boil wort vigorously for 90 minutes, adding hops at times indicated. (As an option, add 1⁄2 tsp. calcium chloride at the beginning of the boil.) Knock any hops that cling to the side of your kettle back into the boiling wort. Cool wort and transfer to fermenter. Aerate thoroughly and pitch sediment from yeast starter. Ferment at 68 °F (20 °C) until primary fermentation ends. (This should take about a week.) Rack to secondary fermenter. If you are going to bottle your beer, let it sit for three to four days, add the dry hops and let the beer sit for another three to four days, then bottle it. If you are going to keg your beer, let the beer sit in secondary until it clears substantially (7–10 days), then keg and dry hop.

IBU = 71 SRM = 52 ABV = 10.3%

Round Guys owner Scott Rudich takes a distinctly European approach to this beer, and the Pilsner and Munich malts that form the bulk of the grist lay down a great bready base for the rich brown malt and raisiny crystal to follow.

Ingredients
13.5 lbs. (6.1 kg) Pilsner malt
3 lbs. (1.4 kg) Munich malt
1 lb. (0.45 kg) pale chocolate malt
1 lb. (0.45 kg) brown malt
1 lb. (0.45 kg) roasted barley (500 °L)
0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) crystal malt (120 °L)
12.75 AAU Apollo hops (60 min.) (0.75 oz./21 g at 17% alpha acid)
8.4 AAU Bravo hops (30 min.) (0.6 oz./17 g at 14% alpha acid)
0.6 oz. (17 g) Columbus hops (0 min.)
Safale US-05 or White Labs WLP001 (California Ale) or Wyeast 1056 (American Ale) yeast
2/3 cup (133 g) dextrose (if priming)

Step by Step
Mill the grains, then mix with 6.25 gallons (23.7 L) of 163 °F (73 °C) strike water to reach a mash temperature of 150 °F (66 °C). Hold this temperature for 60 minutes. Vorlauf until your runnings are clear, and being sparge. Sparge the grains with with enough water to obtain 6.5 gallons (24.6 L) of wort. Boil for 60 minutes, adding hops according to the ingredient list and Irish moss if desired.

After the boil, chill the wort to slightly below fermentation temperature, about 63 °F (17 °C). Aerate the wort with pure oxygen or filtered air and pitch yeast.

Ferment at 64 °F (17 °C), raising by one degree Fahrenheit per day to reach 70 °F (21 °C), then hold there until the completion of primary fermentation. Once the beer completes fermentation, reduce temperature to 32 °F (0 °C), then bottle or keg the beer and carbonate to approximately 2.25 volumes.

Extract with Grains Option:
Substitute the Pilsner malt with 8 lbs. (3.6 kg) Pilsen liquid malt extract, and the Munich malt with 3.3 lbs. (1.5 kg) Munich liquid malt extract. Bring 5.4 gallons (20.4 L) of water to approximately 162 °F (72 °C) and hold there. Steep grains for 15 minutes, then remove bag and allow to drain into the wort. Add liquid extract while stirring, and stir until completely dissolved. Boil for 60 minutes, adding hops according to the ingredient list and Irish moss if desired. Now follow the remainder of the all-grain recipe.

2 tsp. Burton water salts (or 2 tsp. gypsum)
1 tsp. Irish moss
9 AAU Bullion hops (bittering) (1.0 oz./28 g of 9% alpha acids)
7 AAU Northern Brewer hops (flavor) (1.0 oz./28 g of 7% alpha acids)
2.5 AAU East Kent Golding hops (aroma) (0.5 oz./14 g of 5% alpha acids)
2.5 AAU East Kent Golding hops (dry hop) (0.5 oz./14 g of 5% alpha acids)
White Labs WLP007 (Dry English Ale), Wyeast 1335 British Ale II), Nottingham or Safale S-04 yeast
2/3 cup light brown sugar (for priming)

Step by step
Heat a gallon of water to 165 °F (74 °C) and throw in grains tied up in muslin bag. Cover kettle and maintain temperature (150–160 °F/66–71 °C) for 20 minutes. Drain grain bag and rinse with hot water until you've collected a total of at least two gallons (7.6 L) of grain "tea." Bring to a boil and add the malt extract, water salts, and bittering (Bullion) hops. Maintain boil for 45 minutes and add the flavoring hops (Northern Brewer) and Irish moss. Boil another 10 minutes, then turn off heat and add the 1/2 oz. (14 g) of Kent Golding hops for finishing. Cool immediately, pour into your sanitized fermenter and pitch your yeast. Ferment below 70 °F (21 °C), if possible. Pulverize the remaining half ounce of hops and add to the bottom of the secondary fermenter immediately before siphoning the wort over from the primary. This will add a wonderful hop bouquet to the final product. Prime with 2/3 cup light brown sugar dissolved in a cup of boiling water. Allow to carbonate at room temperature for at least two or three weeks before sampling. This one's hoppy enough to benefit from some additional aging.

Russian River Brewing Co. Temptation clone
Russian River Brewing Co. Temptation clone
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.062 FG = 1.012 (going into the barrel)
IBU = 28 SRM = 4 ABV = 6.8%

Both the ABV and final gravity of Temptation are based on the beer aging in the barrel prior to the souring process. Owner and brewer Vinnie Cilurzo says, "None of our barrel beers are easy to replicate on a homebrew level, as we are matching specific recipes with specific types of wine barrels. For example, Temptation is aged in Chardonnay barrels exclusively. One suggestion for a homebrewer is to add a little bit of Chardonnay into the beer to get the wine character since they cannot get it from the wood like we do."

Ingredients
11.5 lb. (5.2 kg) 2-row pale malt
10 oz. (0.27 kg) acidulated malt
14 oz. (0.41 kg) dextrin malt
6 AAU Warrior hops (90 mins.) (0.4 oz./11 g of 15.0% alpha acids)
1.8 AAU Styrian Goldings hops (30 mins.) (0.4 oz./11 g of 4.5% alpha acids)
1.4 AAU Styrian Goldings hops (0 mins.) (0.3 oz./8.5 g of 4.5% alpha acids)
White Labs WLP530 (Abbey Ale) or Wyeast 1214 (Belgian Abbey) yeast
Wyeast 5112 (Brettanomyces bruxellensis) or White Labs WLP650 (Brettanomyces bruxellensis) yeast
Wyeast 5335 (Lactobacillus), White Labs WLP677 (Lactobacillus), or Wyeast 5733 (Pediococcus) bacteria
1 cup (200 g) dextrose (for priming)
Oak barrel, staves, beans or chips
Chardonnay (optional)

Step by Step
Mash the grains at 158°F (70°C). Boil for 90 minutes, adding the hops at the times indicated. Pitch the ale or abbey yeast and begin fermentation at 68°F (20°C) and let it free rise to 76°F (24°C). After primary fermentation, drop as much of the yeast out as possible and move the beer to a wine barrel or secondary fermenter (with oak alternative) where Brettanomyces is added. After 8 to 12 weeks of aging with the Brett, add bacteria to beer and top the barrel/fermenter with a neutral base beer or Chardonnay. From here, the beer will sit for another 6 to 9 months. After the barrel aging is complete, bottle condition the beer using a wine yeast (such as Scott Labs RP15) and an appropriate quantity of priming sugar to meet your desired CO2 level (around 3.2 volumes of CO2). High-pressure-rated bottles are strongly suggested.

Extract with grains option:
Substitute 6.6 pounds (3 kg) light liquid malt extract and 1.75 pounds (0.8 kg) light dried malt extract for the 2-row pale malt. Omit the acidulated malt and dextrin malt and add 0.25 ounces (8 mL) 88 percent lactic acid. Add 5 gallons (19 L) water, extract, and lactic acid to the kettle, being sure to add the liquid malt extract off heat to avoid scorching the clumped extract. Follow the remaining portion of the all-grain recipe.

Poor Man's Barrel Option:
Don’t have the budget (or room) for a barrel? Try this "poor man’s" method of emulating some of the aspects of barrel aging. Conduct your primary fermentation in a bucket or ferment the beer with ale yeast, then rack it to a bucket — adding any "bugs" that may be called for. Buckets are more permeable to oxygen than barrels are, so let the beer condition in the bucket for only about 3 months, then rack it to a carboy for the remaining conditioning time. Two weeks before racking, take 3.0 oz. (85 g) of oak cubes (French oak, medium toast) and soak them in wine. Use Chardonnay for the Temptation clone, Pinot Noir for La Roja, Cabernet Sauvignon for Darth Porter and Burgundy or Meritage for Grand Cru and La Folie. Change wine every 3 days to lessen the intensity of the new oak. Add cubes when beer is racked to carboy.

(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.065 FG = 1.016
IBU = 3 SRM = 7 ABV = 6.7%

This recipe from Arizona Wilderness Brewing Co. (Gilbert, Arizona) was a collaboration with Chris Bianco of Pizzeria Bianco and brewed to taste like tres leches cake with the additions of lactose, cinnamon, vanilla, and brown sugar.

Ingredients
7.5 lbs. (3.4 kg) Maris Otter pale malt
1.3 lbs. (0.59 kg) malted oats
1.2 lbs. (0.54 kg) flaked oats
1 lb. (0.45 kg) white Sonora Wheat
4 oz. (113 g) Caraamber® malt (27 °L)
1 lb. (0.45 kg) light brown sugar (90 min.)
1 lb. (0.45 kg) lactose sugar (90 min.)
0.8 AAU East Kent Golding hops (60 min.) (0.2 oz./6 g at 4% alpha acids)
2.5 vanilla beans
0.4 oz. (11 g) ground cinnamon
White Labs WLP002 (English Ale), Wyeast 1968 (London ESB Ale),or Lallemand London ESB Aleyeast
2⁄3 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Seek a mash temperature of 156 °F (69 °C) and hold that for 60 minutes. Raise to 168 °F (76 °C) for mashout. Hold 10 minutes. Sparge with about 5 gallons (19 L) of water to collect roughly 7 gallons (26.5 L) of wort. Mix in both sugar types and boil for 90 minutes total. Add hops at 60 minutes left in the boil. Cool, pitch yeast, aerate, and ferment with a favorite English ale yeast at 70 °F (21 °C). When fermentation is complete, add vanilla beans and cinnamon. Says Head Brewer Chase Saraiva, "We provided a rough guideline for amounts, but this should really be done to your taste. Typically these will be added post-primary based on the profile of the beer. Approximately 2.5 vanilla beans, (Madagascar or Tahitian), sliced and seeded, and 0.4 oz. (11 g) of cinnamon are a good target."

White Labs WLP 051 (American Ale V) or Wyeast 1272 (American Ale II) yeast
0.75 cup (150g) of corn sugar for priming (if bottling)

Step by Step
Steep the crushed grain in 2 gallons (7.6 L) of water at 152 ºF (67 ºC) for 30 minutes. Remove grains from the wort and rinse with 2 quarts (1.8 L) of hot water. Add the liquid and dried malt extracts and boil for 60 minutes. Add the hops, Irish moss and yeast nutrient to the boil as per the schedule. Add the wort to 2 gallons (7.6 L) of cold water in a sanitized fermenter and top off with cold water up to 5 gallons (19 L).

Cool the wort to 75 ºF (24 ºC). Pitch your yeast and aerate the wort heavily. Allow the beer to cool to 68 ºF (20 ºC). Hold at that temperature until fermentation is complete. Transfer to a carboy, avoiding any splashing to prevent aerating the beer. Add the dry hops and allow the beer to condition for 1 week and then bottle or keg. Allow the beer to carbonate and age for three weeks and enjoy your Fender Bender Amber ale clone.

All-grain option:
This is a single step infusion mash using 8 lbs. (3.62 kg) 2-row pale malt to replace the liquid and dried malt extracts. Mix all of the crushed grains with 6 gallons (23 L) of 173 °F (78 °C) water to stabilize at 152 ºF (67 ºC) for 60 minutes. Sparge slowly with 175 ºF (79 ºC) water. Collect approximately 6 gallons (23 L) of wort runoff to boil for 60 minutes. Reduce the 60-minute Magnum hop addition to 0.4 oz. (11 g) (5.5 AAU) and the 30- and 15-minute Centennial additions to 0.25 oz. (7 g) (2.56 AAU) to allow for the higher utilization factor of a full wort boil. The remainder of this recipe and procedures are the same as the extract with grains recipe.

(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.056 FG = 1.008
IBU = 31 SRM = 5 ABV = 6.3%

Ingredients
9 lb. 11 oz. (4.4 kg) US 6-row malt1 lb. 11 oz (765 g) flaked rye
9 oz. (0.26 kg) Turbinado sugar
7.3 AAU Nugget hops (60 min.) (0.56 oz./16 g of 13% alpha acids)
2.2 AAU Amarillo® hops (15 min.)(0.25 oz./7 g of 8.9% alpha acids)

Wyeast 3726 (Farmhouse Ale) yeast (1-qt./1-L yeast starter)
1 cup corn sugar (for priming)

Step by Step
Two or three days before brew day, make the yeast starter, aerating the wort thoroughly (preferably with oxygen) before pitching the yeast. On brew day, mash in the malt and rye at 149 °F (65 °C) in 15 qts. (14 L) of water. Hold at this temperature for 60 minutes. Raise the mash temperature to 170 °F (77 °C), hold for 5 minutes then recirculate. Run off the wort and sparge with water hot enough to keep the grain bed around 170 °F (77 °C). Collect 6.5 gallons (25 L) of wort. (Check that final runnings do not drop below SG 1.010.) Boil the wort for 90 minutes, adding hops at times indicated in the ingredients list. Add the sugar at the end of the boil, stirring to dissolve.

Chill the wort, transfer it to a fermenter and pitch the yeast. Ferment at 85 °F (29 °C). Bottle condition.

Variation: Substitute flaked wheat for rye; substitute Styrian Goldings for Amarillo® and Centennial.

Ingredients
1 lb. (0.45 kg) liquid rye malt extract
2.25 lbs. (1 kg) light dried malt extract
3.3 lbs. (1.5 kg) light liquid malt extract
9 oz. (0.26 kg) Turbinado sugar

1 cup corn sugar (for priming)

Step by Step
Add the dried malt extract and sugar to enough water to make at least 3 gallons (11 L) of wort. Boil wort for 90 minutes, adding hops at times indicated. Keep some boiling water handy and do not let the boil volume dip below 3 gallons (11 L). Add the liquid malt extract in the final 15 minutes of the boil. Chill the wort, transfer to fermenter and top up to 5 gallons (19 L). Aerate the wort and pitch the yeast. Ferment at 85 °F (29 °C). Bottle condition.

Variation: You may use liquid wheat malt extract in place of rye.

Tips for Success:
To hit the standard CO2 level for a typical Belgian beer (about 8 grams per liter), this recipe recommends one cup of sugar, which is a bit more than the typical 3⁄4 cup suggested by most homebrew experts in many recipes. Traditional Belgian yeast requires higher temperatures to condition efficiently, and most Belgian breweries have "warm rooms" for bottle conditioning that hold the temperature constant throughout the conditioning period. You can do this at home by bottle conditioning in a spot that is consistently around 78 °F (25 °C), which is above room temperature. Read more at https://byo.com/story1207.

(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.058 FG = 1.011
IBU = 22 SRM = 16 ABV = 6.2%

Ingredients
10 lbs. (4.5 kg) Golden Promise pale ale malt
1 lb. (454 g) Carafoam® malt
0.75 lb. (340 g) Crisp crystal 77 malt (77 °L)
2.5 oz. (71 g) roasted barley (500 °L)
6 AAU Fuggle hops (60 min.) (1.25 oz./35 g at 4.8% alpha acids)
1 tsp. Irish moss (10 min.)
White Labs WLP007 (Dry English Ale), Wyeast 1098 (British Ale), or LalBrew Nottingham yeast
¾ cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Starting with a medium-thick mash of 1.33 qts./lb. (2.8 L/kg) achieve a mash temperature of 154 °F (68 °C) and hold at this temperature for 60 minutes. Begin lautering by raising mash temperature to 168 °F (76 °C) for mash out. Recirculate for about ten minutes until clear. Sparge using water at 170 °F (77 °C) acidified to a pH near 5.2. Collect 6.5 gallons (24.6 L) in the kettle. Boil for 90 minutes, adding the Fuggle hops with 60 minutes to go, and the Irish moss with 10 minutes remaining. Upon completion of the boil, whirlpool and let rest for 20 minutes.

Chill quickly to 65 °F (18 °C) and collect the wort in the fermenter. Pitch the yeast and aerate well if using a liquid yeast strain. Ferment at 65 °F (18 °C) for about two weeks or until reaching final gravity. Cold crash to 32 °F (0 °C) in a closed container (you don’t want air being sucked back into the vessel). Allow the beer to reach final temperature, then rest an additional two to five days for clarifying. Carbonate to around 2.5 v/v or bottle condition. Serve in a nonic glass between 45 °F (7 °C) and 50 °F (10 °C) for optimum experience.

IBU = 22 SRM = 16 ABV = 6.2%

Ingredients
6.8 lbs. (3.1 kg) Muntons Maris Otter liquid malt extract
1 lb. (454 g) Carafoam® malt
0.75 lb. (340 g) Crisp crystal 77 malt (77 °L)
2.5 oz. (71 g) roasted barley (500 °L)
6 AAU Fuggle hops (60 min.) (1.25 oz./35 g at 4.8% alpha acids)
1 tsp. Irish moss (10 min.)
White Labs WLP007 (Dry English Ale), Wyeast 1098 (British Ale), or LalBrew Nottingham yeast
¾ cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Using a muslin bag for easy removal of the grain, steep your grains for ten minutes in three gallons (11.4 L) of water between 145–160 °F (63–71 °C). Temperature does not have to be specific since the purpose is simply to steep the grains. Upon completion of the steeping, remove the bag, draining the liquid without squeezing the bag. Raise temperature to near boiling and slowly stir in half of the extract. Return to the heat source and raise to boil. Boil for 60 minutes, adding hops at the beginning, Irish moss at 10 minutes remaining, and the rest of the extract with 5 minutes remaining.

Meanwhile, boil and chill about 2.5 gallons (9.46 L) of water so you can top up your wort later. Chill wort quickly to 65 °F (18 °C). Add pre-boiled and chilled water to top up to 5 gallons (19 L). Ferment at 65 °F (18 °C) for about two weeks or until reaching final gravity. Cold crash to 32 °F (0 °C) in a closed container (you don’t want air being sucked into the vessel). Allow beer to reach final temperature, then rest an additional two to five days for clarifying. Carbonate to around 2.5 v/v or bottle condition. Serve in a nonic glass between 45 °F (7 °C) and 50 °F (10 °C) for optimum experience.

Tips For Success:
To ensure a smooth fermentation, best results will come from making a starter if using a liquid strain. The starter will provide an ample amount of yeast and, along with proper aeration, can help reduce the chances of fusel alcohol production. Patience, especially during the cold-conditioning phase, is also very important to produce the clean character desired in an authentic Scottish export ale.

There is no extract substitute for Golden Promise malt. Since Golden Promise is a heritage malt similar to Maris Otter malt (although Scottish vs. British heritage), we used the closest extract we could find, which is Muntons Maris Otter. This will get you "in the ballpark" but the all-grain version will get closer to the original as there are discrepancies between these two base grains.

FG 1.025 (for both Mighty Sahti and Nosedrops)
ABV = 9.1% (Mighty Sahti) and 3.8% (Nosedrops)

Ingredients
18.5 lbs. (8.5 kg) English pale ale malt (3 °L)
2.2 lbs. (1 kg) Munich malt (10 °L)
3 oz. (80 g) juniper berries
2.25 oz (65 g) Any noble hops with about 4% alpha acids
Juniper twigs (or cedar or fir)
Wyeast 1084 Irish Ale Yeast (or a similar yeast with a fruity and smooth character).

Step by Step
Mash in at 120 °F (approximately 50 °C). Add juniper berries and the hops to the mash. Raise the mash temperature slowly over 90 minutes to the boiling point. Boil the mash for 10 minutes. Place a few juniper twigs on top of the false bottom of the lauter tun to cover it with a single layer. Ladle the mash into the lauter tun. Start sparging. Sparge the first 5 gallons into one container for Mighty Sahti. Sparge the second 5 gallons into a separate container for nosedrops.

At the end of the sparge, raise the temperature of both worts to 180 °F (approximately 80 °C) and hold it there for about 20 minutes to sterilize them. But do not boil them! Let cool to about 70 °F (approximately 20 °C) and add yeast. After 3 days of fermentation, siphon the Nosedrops into jugs or bottles and store in a cool place at 35 °F (approximately 2 °C) to cause the fermentation to stop and to ensure that the Nosedrops taste slightly sweet. Ferment the Men’s Sahti for a total of about 7 days. Siphon Men’s Sahti into jugs or bottles and store in cool place (best at around 40 °F, approximately 5 °C). Serve either sahti cold. Pour gently to avoid rousing the yeast sediment.

Strain the hot liquor and separate into two equal portions. Add 9.5 lbs of extract into the first container and 4.75 lbs into the second. Top off both containers with cold water and stir. Let both cool to about 70 °F (approximately 20 °C) and add yeast. After 3 days of fermentation, siphon the Nosedrops into jugs or bottles and store in a cool place at 35 °F (approximately 2 °C) to cause the fermentation to stop and to ensure that the Nosedrops taste slightly sweet. Ferment the Men’s Sahti for a total of about 7 days. Siphon Men’s Sahti into jugs or bottles and store in cool place (best at around 40 °F, approximately 5 °C). Serve either sahti cold. Pour gently to avoid rousing the yeast sediment.

Saint Arnold Brewing Co.'s Elissa IPA
Elissa IPA clone
Saint Arnold Brewing Co., Texas
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.061 FG = 1.010
IBU = 60 SRM = 9 ABV = 6.6%

"A traditional India Pale Ale, the Elissa IPA is very hoppy with a properly balanced malty body. Elissa has huge hop additions in the kettle that give it a wonderful bitterness and is then dry-hopped in the fermenter to create the pleasant floral, hoppy nose. Our reverse osmosis water makes the bitter very soft with no harsh notes to it. The maltiness is derived from British Maris Otter malt. Its rich flavor stands up to the hops that would otherwise dominate this beer. The Elissa is an authentic version of an India Pale Ale (IPA) style."

Ingredients
12 lbs. (5.4 kg) Maris Otter 2-row pale malt
0.71 lbs. (0.32 kg) Crisp crystal malt (45 °L)
13.5 AAU Cascade hops (60 min.) (2.7 oz./34 g of 5% alpha acids)
6 AAU Cascade hops (15 min.) (1.2 oz./34 g of 5% alpha acids)
6 AAU Cascade hops (4 min.) (1.2 oz./34 g of 5% alpha acids)
0.8 oz. (23 g) Cascade whole hops (dry hop)
1 tsp. Irish moss (15 mins)
Wyeast 1028 (London Ale) or White Labs WLP013 (London Ale) or Lallemand Nottingham Ale yeast
0.75 cups corn sugar (for priming)

Step by Step
Brock Wagner says, "Use water with very low CaCO3. Gypsum is your friend." Mash at 156–158 °F (69–70 °C). Boil 90 minutes. Ferment at 72 °F (22 °C).

Extract with grains option: Replace pale malt with 8 lbs. (3.6 kg) Maris Otter liquid malt extract Steep crushed malts in 5 gallons (19 L) water as it heats up. Remove grains when the temperature hits 160 °F (69–71 °C). Stir in liquid malt extract, stirring until completely dissolved. Boil 60 minutes, adding hops as indicated in the ingredients list.

(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.048 FG = 1.008
IBU = 30 SRM = 3 ABV = 5.2%

Saint Arnold Summer Pils is a Munich-style Helles with a delicate, sweet malt taste complemented by an abundant hop aroma and flavor.

Ingredients
9.5 lbs. (4.3 kg) German Pilsner malt
3 oz. (85 g) German Munich malt
7 AAU Hallertauer hops (first wort hop) (1.75 oz./50 g at 4% alpha acids)
3.5 AAU Saaz hops (0 min.) (1 oz./28 g at 3.5% alpha acids)
1.3 AAU Hallertauer hops (0 min.) (0.33 oz./9 g of 4.0% alpha acid)
1 tsp. Irish moss (15 min.)
White Labs WLP830 (German Lager) or Wyeast 2206 (Bavarian Lager) yeast
3/4 cup (150 g) dextrose (if priming)

Step by Step
Mash the grains together at 152 °F (67 °C) for 60 minutes. A slightly thinner than normal mash will produce a higher degree of fermentability. Collect approximately 7 gallons (26.5 L) wort, adding the first wort hop addition to the kettle as you collect the wort. Boil 90 minutes, to result in about 5 gallons (19 L) and add the remaining hops at flameout and let them steep for 10 minutes before cooling. Cool the wort to 75 °F (24 °C), aerate the beer heavily, and pitch your yeast. Allow the beer to cool over the next few hours to 68 °F (20 °C), and hold at this temperature until the beer has begun fermenting, normally about 24 hours. Then cool the beer to 48 °F (9 °C) and hold there for the remainder of the fermentation, probably about 2 more weeks. Bottle or keg when the beer has dropped to its final gravity and fermentation is complete.

Extract only option:
Replace Pilsner and Munich malts with 6.6 lbs. (3 kg) Pilsen liquid malt extract. Add water to make 3 gallons (11 L), and begin to heat. When temperature gets up to about 180 °F (82 °C), remove from heat and stir in the liquid malt extract and bittering hops. When all the extract is dissolved, return to heat and bring to a boil. Follow the remaining portion of the all-grain recipe, topping off to 5 gallons (19 L) after cooling.

Step by Step
Mill the grains, then mix with 4.7 gallons (17.7 L) of 167 °F (75 °C) strike water to achieve a single infusion rest temperature of 152 °F (67 °C). Hold the mash at this temperature for 60 minutes. Adjust mash pH to 5.2 to 5.4 using phosphoric or lactic acid if your pH is too high. Mashout to 170 °F (77 °C) if desired.

Vorlauf until your runnings are clear before directing them to your boil kettle. Batch- or fly-sparge the mash to obtain 6.5 gallons (25 L) of wort. Boil the wort for 60 minutes. At 10 minutes left in the boil, add the Vic Secret hops along with Whirlfloc or Irish moss.

After the boil, cool the wort to approximately 190 °F (88 °C), and add the hopstand hops. Whirlpool for 15 minutes before further chilling the wort to 76 °F (24 °C). Pitch yeast. Allow the fermentation to free rise even up to 94 °F (34 °C) by the end of primary for this beer.

Once primary fermentation is complete, you have a decision to make centered around the barrel-aging character of this beer. See ‘Tips for Success’ for more information. Eventually, carbonate the aged beer to approximately 2.3–2.4 volumes.

Tips for Success:
These tips are in chronological order regarding your batch of brew. First off, unless you have a low amount of residual alkalinity in your brewing liquor, you’ll probably have to adjust your mash pH downward. For this beer, I’d recommend using phosphoric acid or lactic acid to achieve a mash pH between 5.2 and 5.4. Next, as mentioned in the recipes, you’ll have to decide how you want to achieve the barrel-aged character in the beer. If you happen to have a clean Sauvignon Blanc barrel laying around your place or access to one, now is the time to use it. For the 99.99% of us that don’t (hint: Sauvignon Blanc is almost never barrel-aged so good luck trying to find one if you go trying to track one down), you can mimic the effect by soaking a few medium-toasted French oak cubes in your favorite bottle of Sauvignon Blanc for several days before adding to the beer. Be careful though as a Sauvignon Blanc would be aged in a fairly neutral barrel, so don’t go overboard with the duration of the beer on the cubes.

3.36 AAU Hallertau hops (0.84 oz./24 g at 4% alpha acids) (0 min.)
White Labs WLP565 (Saison Ale) or Wyeast 3724 (Belgian Saison) yeast
1 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Belgian Pilsner malt would be the natural choice for the base malt, but you can substitute any high quality malt of a similar flavor and color from a different supplier. I use the cheapest grocery store table sugar I can find. You can spend money on Belgian candi sugar, but I do not feel that the cost is worth it.

Mill the grains and dough-in targeting a mash of around 1.5 quarts of water to 1 pound of grain (a liquor-to-grist ratio of about 3:1 by weight) and a temperature of 149 °F (65 °C). Hold the mash at 149 °F (65 °C) until enzymatic conversion is complete. With the low mash temperature, you may need to lengthen the rest time to 90 minutes or more to get full conversion. Infuse the mash with near boiling water while stirring or with a recirculating mash system raise the temperature to mash out at 168 °F (76 °C). Sparge slowly with 170 °F (77 °C) water, collecting wort until the pre-boil kettle volume is around 6.5 gallons (24.4 L) and the gravity is 1.047 (11.6 °P).

The total wort boil time is 90 minutes, which helps reduce the S-Methyl Methionine (SMM) present in the lightly kilned Pilsner malt and results in less Dimethyl Sulfide (DMS) in the finished beer. Add the bittering hops with 60 minutes left in the boil. Add the sugar and Irish moss or other kettle finings with 15 minutes left in the boil. Add the last hop addition just before turning off the burner. Chill the wort rapidly to 68 °F (20 °C), let the break material settle, rack to the fermenter, pitch the yeast and aerate thoroughly.

You will need two packages of liquid yeast or for better results you can make a 2-L starter from one package. Pitch yeast at 68 °F (20 °C), aerate or oxygenate, and let the temperature rise slowly to 82 °F (28 °C) over the course of one week. Ferment until the yeast drops clear. With healthy yeast, fermentation should be complete in a week, but do not rush it. It is important for the beer to attenuate fully. When finished, carbonate the beer to approximately 3 volumes and serve at 45 to 50 °F (7 to 10 °C).

If you have trouble getting enough attenuation, you can hold off on adding the sugar to the boil. Instead, after the fermentation looks like it has started to slow, mix the sugar with just enough boiling water to make a syrup, then add that to the fermentation. This should encourage the yeast to consume the longer sugars before you add a substantial amount of simple sugar.

Step by Step
Mill or coarsely crack the specialty malt and place loosely in a grain bag. Avoid packing the grains too tightly in the bag, using more bags if needed. Steep the bag in about 3⁄4 gallon (~3 liters) of water at roughly 155 °F (68 °C) for about 30 minutes. Lift the grain bag out of the steeping liquid and rinse with warm water. Allow the bags to drip into the kettle for a few minutes while you add the malt extract. Do not squeeze the bags. Add enough water to the steeping liquor and malt extract to make a pre-boil volume of 5.9 gallons (22.3 liters) and a gravity of 1.051 (12.6 °P). Stir thoroughly to help dissolve the extract and bring to a boil.

Once the wort is boiling, add the bittering hops. The total wort boil time is 60 minutes after adding the bittering hops. Add the sugar and Irish moss or other kettle finings with 15 minutes left in the boil. Add the last hop addition just before turning off the burner. Chill the wort rapidly to 68 °F (20 °C), let the break material settle, rack to the fermenter, pitch the yeast and aerate thoroughly.

Follow the remaining fermentation and packaging instructions for the all-grain version.

Step by Step
Bière de saison is a simple farmers’ brew, so let’s keep the mash process simple, too. Because modern homebrewers probably start out with much better grains than were available to the farmer-brewers of yonder, a simple infusion mash with two saccharification steps is probably sufficient. Mash in at about 144 °F (62 °C) for a 30-minute hydration and beta-amylase rest. Then raise the temperature to around 154 °F (68 °C) for a 30-minute alpha-amylase rest. Sparge with about 180 °F (82 °C) water until the grain bed reaches the mash-out temperature of 168 °F (76 °C).

Maintain that grain bed temperature and keep on sparging until the kettle wort is about 1.058 (14.5 °P), that is, the wort is roughly 10% thinner than at the target OG at the end of the boil. Boil for about an hour. Add the bittering hops at the standard 15 minutes into the boil. If evaporation losses are greater than 10%, liquor the brew down in the kettle with some cold water. But note that precision is not crucial when brewing a bière de saison.

Add the flavor/aroma hops after shut-down and create a gentle whirlpool in the kettle. Let the brew spin for about 30 minutes. Then siphon the wort off the trub. Heat-exchange to a pitching temperature of roughly 72 °F (22 °C) if you pitch the WLP565. Heat-exchange to roughly 80 °F (27 °C) if you pitch the Wyeast 3724. Aerate the brew thoroughly. Let primary fermentation run its full course. Fermentation may slow down once the brew approaches terminal gravity. Be patient. It may take up to three weeks before the brew comes to rest completely. Rack, prime and bottle all in one process. Of course, you can also rack the brew into a keg. In either case, allow for about three months of conditioning and maturation time at or above room temperature, preferably at 73 °F (23 °C).

Ingredients
6.6 lbs. (3.0 kg) Coopers light, unhopped malt extract
23 oz. (0.64 kg) Munich malt
23 oz. (0.64 kg) aromatic malt
23 oz. (0.64 kg) special B malt
21 oz. (0.6 kg) biscuit malt
14 oz. (0.4 kg) dark Belgian candy sugar
9 oz. (0.25 kg) Carapils® dextrin malt
4.25 AAU Northern Brewer hop pellets (60 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g of 8.5% alpha acid)
1.2 AAU Hallertauer hop pellets (60 min.) (0.3 oz./8.5 g of 4.0% alpha acid)
1 AAU Hallertauer hop pellets (30 min.) (0.25 oz./7 g of 4.0% alpha acid)
1.2 AAU U.S. Goldings hop pellets (10 min.) (.25 oz./7 g of 4.75 alpha acid)
0.5 tsp. yeast nutrient (15 min.)
White Labs WLP 530 (Belgian Abbey) or Wyeast 1762 (Belgian Abbey II) yeast
0.75 cup (150g) of corn sugar for priming (if bottling)

Step by Step
Steep the crushed grain in 3 gallons (11.4 L) of water at 156 ºF (69 ºC) for 30 minutes. Remove grains from the wort, add the liquid extract and bring to a boil. While boiling, add the hops as per the hopping schedule. During the boil, use this time to thoroughly sanitize a fermenter. Add the yeast nutrient after 45 minutes of boiling. Now add the wort to 2 gallons (7.6 L) of cold water in the sanitized fermenter and top off with cold water up to 5 gallons (19 L).

Cool the wort to 75 ºF (24 ºC). Pitch your yeast and aerate the wort heavily. Allow the beer to cool to 68 ºF (20 ºC). Hold at that temperature until fermentation is complete. Transfer to a carboy, avoiding any splashing to prevent aerating the beer. Let the beer condition for 1 week and then bottle or keg. Allow to carbonate and condition for 4 additional weeks and enjoy your Belgian Dubbel!

All-grain option
This is a single step infusion mash. Replace the malt syrup with 10 lbs. (4.5 kg) Pilsener malt grain. The other grains remain the same. Mix the crushed grain with 4 gallons (15.2 L) of 172 °F (77 °C) water to stabilize at 156 ºF (69 ºC) for 60 minutes. Sparge slowly with 175 ºF (79 ºC) water. Collect approximately 6 gallons (23 L) of wort runoff to boil for 60 minutes. The remainder of this recipe is the same as the extract-with-grain recipe.

White Labs WLP001 (California Ale), Wyeast 1056 (American Ale), Fermentis Safale US-05 or Lallemand BRY-97 yeast
3⁄4 cups (150 g) dextrose (if priming)

Step by Step
This is a single infusion mash. Mix the crushed grains with 5 gallons (19 L) of 167 °F (75 °C) strike water to stabilize the mash at 155 °F (68 °C). Hold at this temperature for 45 minutes. Vorlauf for 15 minutes then begin sparge. Run off into kettle to achieve volume and pre-boil gravity around 1.051 SG. Boil for 60 minutes, adding hops and yeast nutrients according to the ingredients list. Once you turn off the heat, give the wort a stir for about a minute to create a whirlpool and let that spin and settle out for about 15 minutes before beginning to chill the wort. Cool the wort down to slightly below fermentation temperature, about 65 °F (18 °C). Aerate the wort with filtered air or pure O2 and pitch yeast. Ferment at 68 °F (20 °C) for 1 week or until signs of fermentation have died down. Rack to a secondary vessel and cool beer to 60 °F (16 °C). Condition for an additional 1–2 weeks. Bottle or keg and carbonate to 2.2 volumes of CO2.

Partial mash option:
Replace the Munich malt and reduce the 2-row pale malt in the all-grain recipe to 1.5 lbs. (0.68 kg) and add 3.3 lbs. (1.5 kg) light liquid malt extract and 3.3 lbs. (1.5 kg) Munich liquid malt extract. Place crushed grains in a muslin bag and steep in 1.5 gallons (5.7 L) water at 155 °F (68 °C) for 45 minutes. Remove the grain bag and slowly wash the grains with 1 gallon (3.8 L) of hot water. Transfer wort to brew kettle and top off to 6 gallons (23 L). Just before the water reaches boil, remove from heat and stir in the malt extract until dissolved. Your pre-boil gravity should be around 1.051 SG. Boil for 60 minutes. Follow the remaining portion of the all-grain recipe.

(5 gallon/19 L partial mash)
OG = 1.069 FG = 1.016
IBUs = 27 SRM = 16 ABV = 6.9%

Ingredients
3 lbs. (1.4 kg) wheat dried malt extract
3.3 lbs. (1.5 kg) Munich liquid malt extract
1.5 lbs. (0.68 kg) crystal malt (60° L)
1 lb. (0,45 kg) wheat malt
1.5 lbs. (0.68 kg) Munich malt (20° L)
1 oz. (28 g) Curacáo orange peel (15 min.)
0.5 oz. (14 g) freshly grated ginger root (15 min.)
0.5 tsp. ground cinnamon (15 min.)
6.3 AAU East Kent Goldings hops (60 min.) (1.33 oz./38 g at 4.75% alpha acid)
4.5 AAU Tettnanger hops (2 min.) (1 oz./28 g of 4.5% alpha acid)
4.7 AAU Hallertau Hersbrucker hops (2 min.) (1 oz./28 g of 4.7% alpha acid)
1 tsp. Irish moss (15 min.)
White Labs WLP830 (German Lager) or Wyeast 2206 (Bavarian Lager) yeast
3/4 cup corn sugar to prime

Step by Step
Steep the grains in 5 quarts of water at 150 ºF (66 °C) for 30 minutes. Strain out the grains, add the malt extracts and top up to 5 gallons (19 L). Bring to a boil. When the wort begins boiling, add East Kent Golding hops and boil for 60 minutes. Add spices and Irish moss for the last 15 minutes of the boil.

Add Tettnanger and Hallertau hops for the last 2 minutes of the boil. Remove from heat and cool wort in ice bath or with wort chiller. Transfer to fermentation vessel (glass carboy). Add enough cold water to the wort to bring the volume up to 5 gallons (19 L). Pitch yeast and ferment at 55 ºF (13 °C) for 3 to 4 weeks. Prime, then bottle or keg. You should lager this beer for about 4 weeks prior to serving.

All-Grain Option:
Replace the malt extracts with 5.25 pounds (2.4 kg) of pale malt. Increase the Munich malt to 4 pounds (1.8 kg) and the wheat malt to 4 pounds (1.8 kg). I would suggest a two-step mash schedule for this beer. This involves doing a 30-minute protein rest at 122 ºF (50 °C), followed by 60 minutes at 155º F (68 °C). Use 18 qts. (17 L) mash water.

Step by Step
Mix the crushed grains with 4.5 gallons (17 L) of 165 °F (74 °C) strike water to stabilize the mash at 153 °F (67 °C). Hold at this temperature for 45 minutes. Vorlauf for 15 minutes then begin sparge. Run off into kettle to collect enough wort for a pre-boil gravity of 1.042 (about 6 gallons/19 L). Boil for 60 minutes. Add hops and yeast nutrients according the ingredients list. Turn off the heat, stir the wort for a minute to create a whirlpool and let settle for 15 minutes. Cool the wort to around 53–55 °F (12–13 °C), aerate, and pitch yeast. Ferment at 57 °F (14 °C) for 2 weeks or until signs of fermentation slow down. Rack to a secondary and lager for 3 weeks at 40 °F (5 °C). Add the dry hops for the final week of the lagering phase. If signs of diacetyl are apparent during racking, a diacetyl rest is recommended. Give the beer 2 days at 70 °F (21 °C) to allow the yeast to process any diacetyl before racking over to the secondary vessel. After the lager period is complete, bottle or keg and carbonate to 2.4 volumes of CO2.

Extract option:
Substitute both of the malts in the all-grain recipe with 3.3 lbs. (1.5 kg) light liquid malt extract, 3.3 lbs. (1.5 kg) Munich liquid malt extract, and 0.7 lb. (0.32 kg) extra light dried malt extract. Heat 6 gallons (23 L) soft water in your brew kettle. If you have hard water (> 150 ppm calcium carbonate), you can soften by boiling the water for half an hour and decanting off the precipitated chalk or by cutting your tap water with distilled or reverse osmosis (RO) water. Just before the water reaches boil, remove from heat and stir in the malt extract until all extract is dissolved. Boil for 60 minutes. Follow the remaining portion of the all-grain recipe.

Step by Step

Place crushed specialty grains in a muslin bag and steep in 1 gallon (3.8 L) water at 150–160 °F (66–71 °C) for 20 minutes. Remove the grain bag and slowly wash the grains with 2 qts. (1.9 L) hot water. Transfer wort to brew kettle and top off to make 6.5 gallons (25 L) in your brew kettle. Just before the water reaches boil, remove from heat and stir in the malt extract until all extract is dissolved. Your pre-boil gravity should be around 1.058 SG. Boil for 90 minutes, adding hops and yeast nutrients according to the ingredients list. Turn off the heat, give the wort a stir for a minute to create a whirlpool and let that settle for about 15 minutes. Cool the wort down to about 53–55 °F (12–13 °C). Follow the remainder of the all-grain recipe.

Ashton Lewis is the Master Brewer at Springfield Brewing Company in Springfield, Missouri and the technical editor of BYO. His latest feature article was "The Dark Secrets of Stout," in the January-February 2005 issue. Ashton says, "We settled on Weyermann malt about 5 years ago. This malt gives a more consistent cloudiness, which I feel is important for the style. Our wheat is dry, crisp and refreshing — and has a certain 'snap' from the malted and raw wheats used, as well as a spicy hop nose from the Liberty hops. The foam has a rich, creamy and rocky appearance. Our wheat beer has been our number one seller since we opened in December 1997 and won a gold in the American-style wheat beer category at the Great American Beer Festival (GABF) in 2003 and a bronze in the same category in 2004."

Ingredients
3.7 lbs. (1.7 kg) Weyermann pale wheat malt
0.69 lbs. (0.31 kg) raw (unmalted) wheat
4.8 lbs. (2.2 kg) pale 2-row malt (Cargill Ida-Pils)
3.20 AAU Perle hops (70 mins) (0.40 oz./11 g of 8% alpha acids)
2.20 AAU Liberty hops (30 mins) (0.40 oz./11 g of 5.5% alpha)
0.56 oz. (16 g) Liberty hops (0 mins)
White Labs WLP001 (California Ale) or Wyeast 1056 (American Ale) yeast
1 cup corn sugar (for bottling)

Step by Step
Use a mash water volume of 2.9 gallons (10.9 L) and mash in at 122 °F (50 °C), rest for 20 minutes, heat to 140 °F (60 °C), rest for 30 minutes, heat to 154 °F (68 °C), rest for 30 minutes and heat to 169 °F (76 °C) for mash-off. Transfer the mash to the lauter tun and do a 20-minute vorlauf before sending wort to the kettle. When the top of the grain bed is covered by ~1 inch (~2.5 cm) of wort, begin sparging with 169 °F (76 °C) sparge water. Measure wort gravity towards the end of collection and do not collect wort weaker than 2 °Plato (SG 1.008). Boil wort for 90 minutes. Cool the wort to 64 °F (18 °C) and aerate. Ferment at 64 °F (18 °C). Fermentation is typically down to ~2.8 °Plato (~SG 1.011) in 3 days. Hold temperature at 64 °F (18 °C) for 4 days or until the gravity is no greater than 2.2 °Plato (SG 1.009). Cool beer to 50 °F (10 °C) and hold for 6 days or until the gravity is no greater than 1.9 °Plato (1.008) and then chill to 32 °F (0 °C). Bottle with corn sugar or keg and carbonate to a level of 2.8 volumes of carbon dioxide.

Ingredients

6.6 lbs. (3.0 kg) Briess Light unhopped liquid malt extract
1 lb. (0.45 kg) Briess Munich malt (10 ºL)
1 lb. (0.45 kg) Briess wheat malt
4 oz. (0.11 kg) Briess roasted barley malt
4 oz. (0.11 kg) Briess chocolate malt
10 oz. (0.28 kg) Briess flaked oats
1 tsp. Irish moss (10 min.)
7.1 AAU Goldings hops (60 min.) (1.5 oz./42 g of 4.75% alpha acid)
4.75 AAU Goldings hops (5 min.) (1 oz./28 g of 4.75% alpha acid)
Wyeast 1968 (London ESB Ale) or White Labs WLP002 (English Ale) of Lallemand London ESB Ale yeast
O.75 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step

Steep the crushed malts in 1.5 gallons (5.8 L) of water at 150 ºF (66 ºC) for 30 minutes. Remove grains from wort and add water to make 3 gallons (11 L). Add the malt syrup to your wort and bring to a boil. Add the Goldings bittering hops and Irish moss then boil for 60 minutes. Add the Goldings finishing hops for the last 5 minutes of the boil.
Add the wort to 2 gallons (7.6 L) of cool water in a sanitary fermenter, and top off with cool water to 5.5 gallons (21 L). Cool the wort to 75 ºF (24 ºC) — do not aerate (you want a high ending gravity for this beer!). Pitch your yeast and allow the beer to cool over the next few hours to 68 ºF (20 ºC), and hold at this temperature until the beer has finished fermenting. Then bottle or keg your beer and enjoy!

All-grain option:

This is a single-step infusion mash. Replace the malt syrup with 9.0 lbs. (4.0 kg) of Briess pale 2-row malt, and mix with the rest of your grains in the extract version. Mash the grains together at 150 ºF (66 ºC) for 60 minutes.

Collect approximately 7 gallons (26 L) of wort to boil for 120 minutes, so you have a 5.0-gallon (19-L) yield. The remainder of the recipe is the same as the extract. Enjoy your chocolate oatmeal stout!

Ingredients
6.6 lbs. (3 kg) light sorghum syrup (3 °L)
1.0 lb. (0.45 kg) dark Belgian candi sugar (275 °L)
2 AAU Hallertau Hersbrucker leaf hops (60 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g of 4% alpha acids)
2 AAU Hallertau Hersbrucker leaf hops (40 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g of 4% alpha acids)

2 AAU Hallertau Hersbrucker leaf hops (10 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g of 4% alpha acids)
0.5 oz. (14 g) Juniper Berries, crushed (15 min.)
1 pkg Danstar Belle Saison dry yeast
Priming sugar (if bottling)

Step by Step
Add 6.0 gallons (23 L) of spring water to the brew kettle. For smaller kettles, add 3–4 gallons (11–15 L) initially and top off after boiling with the remainder. Bring the water to 150 °F (66 °C) and begin stirring in the sorghum syrup. Continue stirring until all of the syrup is in solution. Make sure none is collecting at the bottom, as it can scorch just like malt extract. Stir in the Belgian candi sugar and keep working the crystals until they are dissolved. Or if you bought the syrup version, just dump it in and stir briefly. When the wort comes to a boil, add 0.5 oz. (14 g) of Hallertau Hersbrucker leaf hops. Add additional 0.5 oz. (14 g) increments of hops with 40 minutes, 20 minutes, and 10 minutes remaining in the boil. With 15 minutes remaining in the boil, add the crushed juniper berries to the kettle. After 60 minutes of boiling, remove from heat and chill to approximately 70-75 °F (21-24 °C). Transfer the cooled wort to a fermentation vessel and aerate. If the collected wort is less than 5 gallons (19 L), top off with bottled spring water. Pitch the dry yeast directly into the fermenter. Ferment for approximately 7-10 days in the range of 70-76 °F (21-24 °C)

This is the culmination of what we learned during our first year of brewing hazy IPAs. It utilizes two of our favorite "cheater" hops for dry hopping for an intense aroma of passion fruit, gooseberry, and all sorts of citrus.

Ingredients
8.5 lbs. (3.9 kg) Rahr Standard 2-row malt
4 lbs. (1.8 kg) Weyermann Pilsner malt
1.5 lbs. (0.68 kg) Crisp naked malted oats
1.5 lbs. (0.68 kg) Rahr white wheat malt
0.75 lb. (0.34 kg) BestMalz chit malt
1 oz. (28 g) Comet hops (mash)
3 oz. (85 g) Simcoe® hops (0 min.)
2.5 oz. (71 g) GalaxyTM hops (0 min.)
5.5 oz. (156 g) Nelson Sauvin® hops (dry hop)
5.5 oz. (156 g) GalaxyTM hops (dry hop)
RVA 132 (Manchester Ale), Wyeast 1318 (London Ale III), Imperial Yeast A38 (Juice), or LalBrew New England yeast
2⁄3 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by step
Mash at 156 °F (69 °C) with the mash hops added at the outset. Adjust brewing water by adding calcium chloride to achieve 150 ppm chloride and gypsum to achieve 150 ppm sulfate. If needed, add phosphoric acid to achieve a mash pH of 5.2. Collect wort and boil for 60 minutes, adding hops as noted. When the boil is complete add the whirlpool hops without cooling the wort, and allow to sit for 45 minutes before force chilling to 66 °F (19 °C). Transfer the chilled wort to an oversized fermenter. Aerate the wort well as this yeast is sensitive to under-oxygenating, then pitch the yeast. Ferment at 68 °F (20 °C).

Once the gravity stabilizes, chill to 55 °F (13 °C). Transfer to a purged keg with dry hops placed in screens. Dry hop for three days at 55 °F (13 °C), agitating once or twice daily for 30 seconds. Transfer off the hops to a serving keg. Pressurize to reach 2.4 volumes of CO2.

Partial mash option: Replace 2-row, Pilsner, and wheat malts with 4 lbs. (1.8 kg) extra light dried malt extract, 2 lbs. (0.91 kg) Pilsen dried malt extract, and 1.6 lbs. (0.73 kg) wheat dried malt extract. In a muslin bag, heat the crushed oats, chit malt, and mash hops in 4 qts. (4 L) of water to 164 °F (73 °C). Mash at around 156 °F (69 °C) for 45–60 minutes. When the mash is done, remove the grains and wash with 1 gallon (4 L) of hot water. Bring volume up to 6 gallons (23 L) and stir in the malt extract. Follow the remainder of the all-grain recipe.

Sapwood Cellars’ one and only kettle sour was a sour IPA showing off Wai-iti and Waimea hops from New Zealand. The result was fruitier than some of our fruited sours, with big lime and stone fruit aromatics. The post-souring whirlpool serves both to kill the Lactobacillus and impart "kettle character" from the hops.

Ingredients
6.75 lbs. (3 kg) Rahr Standard 2-row malt
3 lbs. (1.4 kg) Rahr Pilsner malt
0.875 lb. (0.4 kg) Crisp oat malt
0.875 lb. (0.4 kg) BestMalz spelt malt
6 oz. (170 g) Waimea hops (hop stand)
6 oz. (170 g) Wai-iti hops (dry hop)
3 oz. (85 g) Waimea hops (dry hop)
~10–15 mL 88% lactic acid
Omega Lactobacillus blend
Omega Yeast OYL-200 (Tropical IPA) or White Labs WLP644 (Saccharomyces "Bruxellensis" trois) yeast
Yeast nutrient per manufacturer’s directions

Step by step
Mash at 157 °F (69 °C), adding calcium chloride to achieve 150 ppm chloride. If needed to achieve a mash pH of 5.2, add phosphoric acid. Collect wort and boil for 60 minutes. At the end of the boil, add lactic acid to achieve a pH of 4.4. Chill wort to 95 °F (35 °C). Pitch an active starter of Lactobacillus. Don’t worry about maintaining this temperature. Allow to sour to a pH of 3.3 (or as desired), approximately 12–24 hours. Heat to 175 °F (79 °C) and add whirlpool hops and nutrient. Allow to sit for 40 minutes before force chilling to 66 °F (19 °C). Transfer to a fermenter, aerate, and pitch yeast. Ferment at 68 °F (20 °C).

Once the gravity stabilizes, chill to 55 °F (13 °C). Transfer to a purged keg with dry hops placed in screens. Dry hop for three days at 55 °F (13 °C),
agitating once or twice daily for 30 seconds. Transfer off the hops to a serving keg. Pressurize to reach 2.5 volume of CO2.

Partial mash option: Replace 2-row and Pilsner malts with 3.5 lbs. (1.6 kg) extra light dried malt extract and 1.6 lbs. (0.73 kg) Pilsen dried malt extract. In a muslin bag, heat the crushed oats and spelt in 3 qts. (3 L) of water to 164 °F (73 °C). Mash at around 157 °F (69 °C) for 45–60 minutes. Remove the grains and wash with 1 gallon (4 L) of hot water. Bring volume up to 6 gallons (23 L) and stir in the malt extract. Follow the remainder of the all-grain recipe.

Wyeast 1272 (American Ale II) or White Labs WLP051 (California V) or Lallemand Nottingham yeast
3⁄4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by step
Mash at 154 °F (68 °C) with the mash hops added at the outset. Adjust brewing water by adding calcium chloride to achieve 50 ppm chloride and gypsum to achieve 200 ppm sulfate. If needed, add phosphoric acid to achieve a mash pH of 5.2. Collect wort and boil for 60 minutes, adding hops as noted. When the boil is complete add the whirlpool hops without cooling the wort, and allow to sit for 45 minutes before force chilling to 66 °F (19 °C). Transfer the chilled wort to an oversized fermenter. Aerate the wort and pitch the yeast. Ferment at 68 °F (20 °C).

Once the gravity stabilizes, chill to 40 °F (4 °C). Transfer to a purged keg with dry hops placed in screens. Dry hop for three days at 50 °F (10 °C), agitating once or twice daily for 30 seconds. Transfer off the hops to a serving keg. Pressurize to reach 2.5 volumes of CO2.

Partial mash option: Replace 11.5 lbs. (5.2 kg) of the 2-row malt with 6 lbs. (2.7 kg) of extra light dried malt extract.

This hoppy wheat beer was designed to introduce hop-averse beer drinkers to the new ways hops are being used. A low-temperature whirlpool reduces alpha acid isomerization, allowing more hop flavor without big bitterness. Dry hops added to the fermenter before knockout add additional fruitiness without a raw-green aroma. A small addition of hefeweizen yeast adds subtle banana notes underpinning the apricot and peach aromas for Amarillo®.

Treat water to achieve 150 ppm chloride and 75 ppm sulfate. Combine milled grains, salts, and 9 bbls (11 hL) of hot water to achieve a mash temperature of 156 °F (69 °C). Add phosphoric acid as needed to reach a mash pH of 5.4. Sparge with 6 bbl (7 hL) of 178 °F (81 °C) water dosed with 50 mL of 75% phosphoric acid. Boil the 11 bbls of wort adding Whirlfloc as noted.

At the end of the boil add 1 bbl of cold water to cool the wort to 195 °F (91 °C) before adding the whirlpool hop addition. The lower temperature reduces isomerization. Whirlpool for 75 minutes.

Place the dry hops into the fermenter. Chill wort to 64 °F (18 °C), transfer to fermenter, and aerate. Pitch 5 sachets of WB-06 along with one-and-a-half 500 g packages of S-04. No rehydration necessary. Hold fermentation at 64 °F (18 °C) for three days, then allow to warm to 66 °F (19 °C) until fermentation is complete. Crash cool to 32 °F (0 °C) for three days to drop out the yeast and hops. Prime and bottle or keg targeting 2.6 volumes of CO2.

Ingredients
7 lbs. (3.2 kg) Rahr standard 2-row malt
2 lbs. (0.91 kg) Rahr white wheat malt
1 lb. (0.45 kg) Briess Caramel Vienne malt (20 °L)
1 Whirlfloc tablet (15 min.)
1.2 oz. (33 g) Amarillo® hops (0 min.)
1.7 oz. (47 g) Amarillo® hops (dry hop)
7 g calcium chloride
3.5 g calcium sulfate
5 mL (1 tsp.) 75% phosphoric acid
1 sachet (11 g) SafAle S-04 yeast
1 g SafAle WB-06 yeast
¾ cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Treat water to achieve 150 ppm chloride and 75 ppm sulfate. Combine milled grains, salts, and 5 gallons (19 L) of hot water to achieve a mash temperature of 156 °F (69 °C). Add phosphoric acid as needed to reach a mash pH of 5.4. Sparge with 3 gallons (11 L) of 178 °F (81 °C) water dosed with 1 mL (~1/4 tsp.) of 75% phosphoric acid. Boil the wort, adding Whirlfloc as noted.

At the end of the 60-minute boil, add 2 qts. (1.9 L) of cold water to cool the wort to 195 °F (91 °C) before adding the whirlpool hop addition. The lower temperature reduces hop isomerization. This is probably unnecessary at home where the smaller volume and shorter timescale will limit the amount of bitterness contributed. Whirlpool for 75 minutes.
Place the dry hops into the fermenter. Chill wort to 64 °F (18 °C), transfer to fermenter, and aerate. Pitch yeast, using only a pinch of the WB-06. No rehydration is necessary. Hold fermentation at 64 °F (18 °C) for three days, then allow to warm to 66 °F (19 °C) until fermentation is complete. Crash cool to 32 °F (0 °C) for three days to drop out the yeast and hops. Prime and bottle or keg targeting 2.6 volumes of CO2.

(5 gallons/19 L, extract with grains)
OG = 1.048 FG = 1.009
IBU = 20 SRM = 3.1 ABV = 5.1%

Ingredients
3.3 lbs. (1.5 kg) Muntons, extra light, unhopped, malt extract
10 oz. (0.28 kg) light, dried malt extract
1 lb. (0.45 kg) pale malt
1.75 lb. (0.79 kg) flaked corn
8.0 oz. (0.22 kg) flaked barley
8.0 oz. (0.22 kg) Carapils® dextrin malt
5.5 AAU Willamette hop pellets (60 min.) (1 oz./28 g at 5.5% alpha acids)
1.37 AAU Willamette hop pellets (15 min.) (0.25 oz./7 g at 5.5% alpha acids)
1/2 tsp. Irish moss (30 min.)
1/2 tsp. yeast nutrient (15 min.)
White Labs WLP 001 (American Ale) or Wyeast 1056 (American Ale) yeast
0.75 cup (150 g) of corn sugar for priming (if bottling)

Step by Step
Steep the crushed grain and flaked corn in 2 gallons (7.6 L) of water at 152 ºF (67 ºC) for 30 minutes. Remove grains from the wort and rinse with 2 quarts (1.8 L) of hot water. Add the liquid and dry malt extracts and boil for 60 minutes. While boiling, add the hops, Irish moss and yeast nutrient as per the schedule. Once the boil is complete, add the wort to 2 gallons (7.6 L) of cold water in the sanitized fermenter and top off with cold water up to 5 gallons (19 L).

Cool the wort to 75 ºF (24 ºC). Pitch your yeast and aerate the wort heavily. Allow the beer to cool to 68 ºF (20 ºC). Hold at that temperature until fermentation is complete. Transfer to a carboy, avoiding any splashing to prevent aerating the beer. Allow the beer to condition for one week and then bottle or keg. Allow the beer to carbonate and age two weeks.

All-grain option:
This is a single step infusion mash using 4 lbs. (1.81 kg) Pilsner malt and an additional 2.25 lbs. (1.02 kg) 2-row pale malt to replace the liquid and dried malt extracts. Mix the crushed grains with 6 gallons (22.7 L) of 173 °F (78 °C) water to stabilize at 152 ºF (67 ºC) for 60 minutes. Sparge with 175 ºF (79 ºC) water. Collect approximately 6 gallons (22.7 L) of wort runoff to boil for 60 minutes. Reduce the 60-minute Willamette hop addition to 0.8 oz. (23 g) (4.4 AAU) to allow for the higher utilization factor of a full wort boil. Follow the remainder of the extract with grains recipe.

Sauerkraut
Sauerkraut
Ingredients
1 medium cabbage (about 21⁄2 lbs./1.1 kg)
1.5–2 tsp. salt per lb. (0.45 kg) of cabbage

Step by step
As with any ferment, the better the ingredients, the better the end result will be. Sauerkraut, however, is a little more forgiving than some others. Sauerkraut (and other similar cabbage ferments), are one of the most common fermented foods on the planet for a variety of reasons. Cabbage is cheap, ubiquitous, and hardy. Sauerkraut is versatile and can be adapted to utilize a variety of ingredients that you may have on hand and wish to use up. It’s also more forgiving, since even winter cabbage from the grocery store can still be transformed into a respectable sauerkraut. Just about any variety of cabbage can make for a good kraut — red cabbage kraut is especially tasty. Small amounts of other veggies, like carrots or jalapeños, make for a nice twist, as do spices like caraway or rosemary.

While kraut is more forgiving once fermentation is underway, the preparation stage demands a bit more grunt work than other ferments. Like other veggie ferments, sauerkraut needs an anaerobic environment. But kraut is generally made without adding brine, as cabbage itself already contains plenty of water. During the preparation stage you’ll have to get rough with it. A good kraut requires aggression, and you’ll need to really work to pack it all into the jar. The harder you pack, the more liquid will be released, and you’ll have to compel the cabbage to release enough of its water to form a brine that covers the top of the veggies.

First, remove the outer leaves of your cabbage as well as any that are damaged. Cut the cabbage into quarters and remove the solid core. Rinse the cabbage well with cold water, allowing the water to flow between the cabbage leaves. This will remove any dirt and bugs that may be along for the ride, but will not affect the microbes that you’ll need for fermentation. Set one broad, thicker outer leaf to the side. Shred the remaining cabbage with a knife or food processor. The chopped bits have to be fine enough that the whole jar of kraut can be packed down relatively densely, but before you transfer to a jar, place the cabbage in a large bowl. Sprinkle the calculated amount of salt over the cabbage, then toss well. Allow the cabbage and salt mixture to rest about 15–30 minutes so the salt can be absorbed.

After about half an hour, the cabbage should have released a good bit of its moisture. After this, pack the cabbage into a clean glass quart jar. Pour any liquid left in the bowl into the jar — although this likely won’t be enough to cover the cabbage just yet. Keep packing the cabbage down until enough juice has been released to submerge the vegetables almost all the way. You should be able to get close, though some may struggle to get all the way to complete submersion. If needed, top off with a 2% solution of salt water (1 teaspoon salt per cup of water). If using a weight system to keep the veggies under the brine, take the reserved cabbage leaf and cut or fold it so that it covers the rest of the cabbage at the top of the jar. This extra leaf can be held under a weight to create an additional buffer between the veggies and any attacking mold.

A Stroll by the Wandle
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.039 FG = 1.010
IBU = 28 SRM = 11 ABV = 3.8%

This is inspired by the wonderful time I had visiting Sambrook's Brewery in London to meet with the London Amateur Brewers club. While all of the beers at Sambrook's are masterfully brewed, I really enjoyed their Wandle ale, which they named after a river near the brewery. I based this recipe on information Head Brewer Sean Knight shared with me about Wandle. Any errors are all mine.

Ingredients
7.5 lbs. (3.4 kg) English pale malt
6.4 oz. (180 g) English crystal malt (150 °L)
5.4 AAU Boadicea hops (60 min.) (0.6 oz./18 g at 9% alpha acids)
0.5 oz. (14 g) Fuggle hops (0 min.)
0.5 oz. (14 g) Goldings hops (0 min.)
White Labs WLP002 English Ale or Wyeast 1968 (London ESB Ale) yeast

Step by Step
I use Crisp Malting's British Pale Ale malt (made from Maris Otter) as my base grain, but other malts of a similar nature should work well. Remember, the bulk of the flavor comes from the base grain, so try to get British pale ale malt. The crystal malt should also be of British origin as it makes a substantial difference. I have had great success with Simpsons and Bairds, but feel free to substitute any high quality malt of a similar flavor and color from a different supplier. My hops are in pellet form and come from the UK via Hop Union or Hopsteiner.

Mill the grains and dough-in targeting a mash of around 1.5 quarts of water to 1 pound of grain (a liquor-to-grist ratio of about 3:1 by weight) and a temperature of 150 °F (66 °C). Hold the mash at 150 °F (66 °C) until enzymatic conversion is complete. Infuse the mash with near boiling water while stirring or with a recirculating mash system raise the temperature to mash out at 168 °F (76°C). Sparge slowly with 170 °F (77 °C) water, collecting wort until the pre-boil kettle volume is around 5.9 gallons (22.3 L) and the gravity is 1.033.

Once the wort is boiling, add the bittering hops. The total wort boil time is 1 hour after adding the bittering hops. During that time add the Irish moss or other kettle finings with 15 minutes left in the boil and the last hop addition at flame out. Chill the wort to 68 °F (20 °C) and aerate thoroughly. If you have a nice, fresh package of liquid yeast, you can pitch it direct, although making a 1-liter starter is always a good idea.

If you are adventurous, you might consider open fermentation, as they do at Sambrook's Brewery. Ferment in a bucket with the lid set loosely on top until krauesen forms, which can help protect the beer from contamination. Ferment around 68 °F (20 °C) until the yeast drops clear. With healthy yeast, fermentation should be complete in a week or less. Allow the lees to settle and the brew to mature without pressure for another two days after fermentation appears finished. Rack to a keg and force carbonate or rack to a bottling bucket, add priming sugar, and bottle. Target a carbonation level of 1 to 2 volumes depending on your packaging. If you cask condition the beer, allow it to condition in the cask for several days and serve via a beer engine or by gravity feed at 50–55 °F (10–13 °C).

IBU = 28 SRM = 15 ABV = 14%

Once the world’s strongest beer, Samichlaus is a doppelbock that continues to develop the longer it is aged.

Ingredients
21 lbs. (9.5 kg) Pilsner malt (2 °L)
2 lbs. (0.91 kg) Vienna malt (3 °L)
1.5 lbs. (0.68 kg) Carabohemian malt (65 °L)
2 lbs. (0.91 kg) cane sugar (60 min.)
12.8 AAU Northern Brewer hops (60 min.)
(1.5 oz./43 g at 8.5% alpha acids)
2.3 AAU Tettnang hops (15 min.)
(0.5 oz./14 g at 4.5% alpha acids)
0.5 oz. Hallertau Mittelfruh hops (2 min.)
1 tsp. Irish moss (15 min.)
White Labs WLP885 (Zurich Lager) yeast
(7 qt./~7 L yeast starter)
1/2 cup (100 g) dextrose (if priming)

Step by Step
Mash the grains with 8.3 gallons (31 L) of water at 113 °F (45 °C). Step mash with rests at 104 °F (40 °C), 122 °F (50 °C), 140 °F (60 °C) and 158 °F (70 °C). Collect 13 gallons (49 L) of wort. Boil to reduce to 5 gallons (19 L), at least 5 hours, adding hops as indicated. Cool wort, aerate well and pitch yeast sediment from starter. Ferment for 30–45 days at 52 °F (11 °C). Rack to secondary, add fresh yeast and let temperature rise to 60 °F (16 °C), then lager for about 180 days at 38 °F (3.3 °C). Bottle or keg, shooting for 2.20 volumes CO2.

Extract with grains option:
Substitute the Pilsner malt and Vienna malt in the all-grain recipe with 10 lbs. (4.5 kg) extra light dried malt extract and 3.3 lbs. (1.5 kg) Munich liquid malt extract. Steep grains at 148 °F (64 °C) for 30 minutes in 5 gallons (19 L) of water. Boil wort for 60 minutes, stirring in malt extracts at the beginning of the boil off heat. Follow the remaining portion of the all-grain recipe.

Tips For Success:
The best approach to making a beer of this strength while using a lager yeast is to brew a smaller lager beer and re-use the yeast collected from that batch for pitching into this wort. If you do not have time to brew a full batch, then even a small batch beer would work well. If you end up making a 7 qt. (7 L) yeast starter, be sure to refrigerate the yeast once it has grown up so you can decant the beer off the yeast cake prior to pitching.

(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.056 FG = 1.014
IBU = 15 SRM = 8 ABV = 5.6%

Ingredients
7.4 lbs. (3.4 kg) Weyermann pale wheat malt (2 °L)
1.85 lbs. (0.84 kg) Weyermann Pilsner malt (1.8 °L)
1.85 lbs. (0.84 kg) Weyermann Vienna malt (3.3 °L)
0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) Caramunich® Type III malt (56 °L)
3.1 AAU Hallertau Mittelfrüh hops (30 min.) (0.74 oz./21 g at 4.2% alpha acids)
4.2 AAU Hallertau Mittelfrüh hops (10 min.) (1 oz./28 g at 4.2% alpha acids)
2 packages of White Labs WLP380 (Hefeweizen IV Ale) or Wyeast 3068 (Weihenstephan Weizen) yeast (one for primary fermentation, one for inoculating Speise)
2 qts. (2 L) sterile wort (for bottle conditioning)

Step by Step
Dough in at 99 °F (37 °C) with about 2 gallons (~7.5 L) of water. This amounts to a 2:1 liquor to grist ratio. Allow for a 30-minute rest to thoroughly hydrate the grist, then bring the grain bed gradually to the mash-out temperature of 145 °F (63 °C) using a hot-water infusion and direct heat. While ramping up, employ a 20-minute protein and beta-glucan rest at 122 °F (50°C). Give the grain bed a 60-minute rest at 145 °F (63 °C) to allow for thorough starch conversion, then recirculate the first runnings until they are clear and sparge while maintaining a stable grain bed temperature. Boil 60 minutes adding hops as indicated. After flameout, carefully stir the hot wort for one minute in to create a whirlpool. About 30 minutes into the whirlpool, draw about 2 quarts (2 L) of hot, sterile wort from the top of the kettle (where there is less trub than below) into a sealable container. Let that wort cool; then store it in the refrigerator during the brew’s primary fermentation. You will need this wort later as a priming agent, called Speise, during bottle conditioning. Continue whirlpooling for another 30 minutes, by which time, plenty of protein-rich trub should have accumulated in the center-bottom of the brew kettle. Siphon the clarified wort carefully off the debris and heat exchange it into a clean carboy (or bucket for open fermentation) with the pitched yeast. Aerate the wort and ferment it at a temperature of 68 °F (20 °C) for about four days. The brew should now be at the terminal gravity of FG 1.012 and ready for bottle conditioning. On bottling or kegging day, take the Speise out of the refrigerator and let it warm up to room temperature. Because at home you are dealing with just a single batch, you must inoculate your saved "unpitched" wort before using it as a Speise. Thus, pitch the second package of yeast into your Speise, close the container and shake it vigorously to aerate it. Then pour the Speise into a clean carboy or a keg and rack the fully fermented brew into it for a thorough mix. Transfer the inoculated beer into bottles or keep it in the closed keg. Once mixed with Speise, let the beer condition for about one week at a cozy room temperature of 70 °F (21 °C). This will produce the hefeweizen’s spritzy carbonation. Also at this temperature, the flavor of the hefeweizen becomes soft and mellow with mild banana tones starting to emerge next to clove and phenol notes. Then cool-condition the brew for another two weeks at about 45 °F (7 °C), which is also a good serving temperature.

Extract only option: Substitute all of the grains in the all-grain recipe with 8.2 lbs. (3.7 kg) Weyermann Bavarian Hefeweizen liquid malt extract. Bring 5.5 gallons of water to a boil and stir in extract. Boil for 60 minutes. Follow the remaining portion of the all-grain recipe.

This beer is basically a wheat doppelbock, made to compete with the true doppelbocks. It features notes of raisins, plums, bananas, cloves, and a touch of chocolate. A decoction mash and extended boil are really needed to bring out the dark malt and caramel flavors.

Ingredients
9 lbs. (4.1 kg) wheat malt
4.75 lbs. (2.15 kg) Pilsner malt
1.5 lbs. (0.68 kg) Caramunich® malt
0.33 lb. (0.15 kg) Carafa® Special I malt
3 AAU Hallertau Hersbrucker hops (60 min.) (0.75 oz./21 g at 4% alpha acids)
Wyeast 3068 (Weihenstephan Weizen) or White Labs WLP300 (Hefeweizen Ale) yeast
1 1/4 cups (250 g) dextrose (if priming)

Step by Step
Employ a triple decoction mash. Mash in cold with 2–2.5 qts./lb. (4.2–5.2 L/kg) water. Bring up to 95 °F (35 °C) with direct heat. Pull a third of the mash, boil for 30 minutes. Add back to main mash to bring temperature up to 131 °F (55 °C). Repeat the decoction. Add back to main mash, which should be at 146 °F (63 °C). Repeat decoction, boil for 45 minutes to an hour. Add back to main mash to raise temperature to 166 °F (74 °C). Let stand a few minutes then move on to lautering and sparge. Wort boil time is 60 minutes, adding hops at the beginning of the boil. Cool, aerate, and pitch yeast. Ferment at 60 °F (16 °C). Condition in secondary for three to four weeks at 42 °F (6 °C) and then bottle or keg as normal.

Extract with grains option: Replace the Pilsner and wheat malts with 9.5 lbs. (4.3 kg) liquid wheat malt extract. Place crushed grains in a nylon steeping bag and steep grains in 3 gallons (11 L) of water as it heats up to at 170 °F (76 °C). While steeping, begin heating 2 gallons (7.6 L) of water to a boil in your brewpot. After steep, place bag in colander over brewpot. Pour "grain tea" through bag, then rinse bag with 1.5 qts. (~1.5 L) of 170 °F water. Bring brewpot to a boil, then remove from heat and stir in the liquid malt extract. Stir until all the extract has dissolved and return to a boil. Add hops and boil wort for 60 minutes. Cool wort and top off to 5 gallons (19 L). Follow the remaining portion of the all-grain recipe

Tips For Success: Be sure to try to ferment this on the cooler side of the suggested fermentation temperature range. The hefe strain is know to throw some fusel alcohols during more vigorous fermentations, so keeping the fermentation vigor in check through proper temperature control is a good way to keep these unwanted by-products out of your beer.

An experimental batch with several new hops in my freezer. It proved to be a pungent/grassy mix with a healthy citrus and tropical fruit kick to the nose.

Ingredients
9.5 lbs. (4.3 kg) 2-row pale malt
2 lbs. (0.91 kg) white wheat malt
6 oz. (170 g) flaked oats
6 oz. (170 kg) Weyermann Caramunich® I (34 °L)

2 oz. (57 g) Galaxy hop pellets (2nd stage dry hop)
1 oz. (28 g) Equinox™ hop pellets (2nd stage dry hop)
White Labs WLP005 (California Ale IV) or Wyeast 1272 (American Ale II) yeast
1 tsp. gypsum
2/3 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
This is a single infusion mash. Heat 4.6 gallons (17.4 L) strike water to 170 °F (77 °C) to stabilize the mash temperature at 154 °F (68 °C). Rest at this temperature for 45 minutes then begin lautering Collect 5.75 gallons (22 L) of wort and add gypsum. Boil for 60 minutes adding the hops at the termination of boil. Do not chill, but rather give the wort a stir to create a whirlpool for a minute. Let the hot wort settle for a total of 30 minutes with the lid on the pot to keep those essential oils contained.

After the 30 minute whirlpool phase, chill the wort to 68 °F (20 °C), then pitch an appropriate yeast starter (~1 qt./1 L) and aerate the wort thoroughly. Ferment at 68 °F (20 °C). Let primary fermentation proceed for several days until you notice airlock activity to be greatly diminished. Rack off the beer into a receiving vessel with the 1st stage dry hops at the bottom of the receiving vessel. This yeast strain is fairly flocculent, but the goal after 3-4 days on the 1st stage hops is to get the yeast to drop out. Your options are to chill the beer to about 55 °F (13 °C) or possibly add a fining agent of your choice. If you do chill the beer, be careful of suck back (when air is sucked back into the fermenter). You can either put a stopper on the carboy/bucket or do this in a corny keg. You can either rack off into a CO2 flushed receiving vessel or you can just simply add the 2nd stage dry hops once the beer has cleared. Wait another 3-4 days. Transfer to keg and force carbonate or bottle with priming sugar. Carbonate the beer to 2.4 volumes CO2.

Stadtmumme (second runnings)
OG = 1.043 (before a 75-minute boil) FG = 1.005
IBU = 40 SRM = 7 ABV = 4.8%

Ingredients
14.44 lbs. (6.55 kg) German Pilsner malt
0.79 lb. (0.36 kg) Weyermann Caramunich® I malt
0.79 lb. (0.36 kg) melanoidin malt
Segelschiffmumme: 16.4 AAU Saaz hops (60 min.) (4.1 oz./116 g at 4% alpha acids)
Stadtmumme: 9.4 AAU Saaz hops (60 min.) (2.34 oz./66 g at 4% alpha acids)
Any strong attenuating ale yeast (such as SafAle US-05)
3⁄4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step for both Segelschiffmumme and Stadtmumme
Set the mill gap for this heavy grain bed to approximately 1.5 mm. Mash-in for both beers at 126 °F (52 °C) at a liquor-to-grist ratio 2.6:1 by weight (1.25 qts./lb.). Rest 10 minutes. Raise temperature to 144 °F (62 °C) and rest 25 minutes. Raise temperature to 154 °F (68 °C) and rest 25 minutes. Raise temperature to 162 °F (72 °C) and rest 20 minutes. Raise temperature to 172 °F (78 °C) for the mash-out. Recirculate until clear, then sparge. Continue lautering until kettle gravity is about 1.088 then discontinue runoff to that kettle. Boil the wort for the segelschiffmumme, to achieve 30% evaporation, or when SG is about 1.128. This portion of the wort develops a reddish, sour-cherry-like sheen. Taste this high-gravity wort: It has a surprisingly pleasant, melanoidin-derived taste of bread crust, malt candy, and toffee. Pour this wort into a coolship for overnight cooling, sedimentation, and aeration.

For the second-runnings stadtmumme, continue lautering and sparging the same mash into a separate kettle, until the OG is about 1.043. Boil this wort for 75 minutes; and finish the brew in the usual fashion through heat-exchanging and fermenting it.

Extract with grains versions: The use of extracts can easily be swapped out for the segelschiffmumme recipe but creating the stadtmumme is hard to achieve with an extract-based recipe. For the segelschiffmumme, simply replace the Pilsner malt with 6.25 lbs. (2.8 kg) Pilsen dried malt extract while maintaining the same pre-boil and post-boil volumes as well as hopping rates. Steep the grains in the water as it heats up to 170 °F (77 °C). Remove grains and stir in the dried malt extract while off heat. When all the extract is dissolved bring wort to a boil, adding hops according to the all-grain recipe. The rest of the all-grain instructions can be followed.

Sensory Evaluation of both schiff- and stadtmumme Test Brews: The schiffmumme is truly a "big" beer. It is chestnut brown, slightly turbid, with a creamy, fine, and long-lasting head of foam. The bouquet is powerful with notes of strawberry, gooseberry, and dried fruit. On the palate, the mouthfeel is velvety with the alcohol providing warming underpinnings for delicate notes of caramel and creamy sweets, both of which linger. The long-lasting, malty finish has mildly estery hints of mint and pear. Overall, this beer is rich and absolutely delicious.

The color of the stadtmumme is much lighter, but in most sensory aspects it resembles its mighty cousin, but in a restrained fashion. The bouquet and the upfront taste are reminiscent of sweet, creamy caramel and apple pie. These notes give way to a brief but distinct sensation of hop bitterness, which fades relatively quickly. This ale is surprisingly substantial and complex on the palate considering that it is a mere second-runnings brew.

Transfer to a carboy, avoiding any splashing to prevent aerating the beer. Allow the beer to condition for one week and then bottle or keg. Allow the beer to carbonate and age for two weeks.

All-grain option
This is a single step infusion mash using 8 lbs. (3.6 kg) of 2-row pale malt to replace the malt extracts. Mix the crushed grains with 3.75 gallons (14 L) of 172 °F (78 °C) water to stabilize at 156 ºF (69 ºC) for 60 minutes. Sparge slowly with 175 ºF (79 ºC) water. Collect approximately 6 gallons (23 L) of wort runoff to boil for 60 minutes.

Reduce the 60-minute hop addition to 1 oz. (28 g) Challenger hop pellets to allow for the higher utilization factor of a full wort boil.

The remainder of this recipe and procedures are the same as the extract with grain recipe.

(5 gallons/19 L, extract with grains)
OG = 1.047 FG = 1.008
IBU = 30 SRM = 3.5 ABV = 5.1%

Saison is a style that many homebrewers jump to in the summer months due to the yeast’s tolerance of a warmer fermentation. Brewers yet to arrange temperature-control for their fermenters can still brew a saison and have it come out reasonably well. Many commercial examples of the style weigh in at around 7%+ ABV, which can make for heavy going in the heat of summer. Already a dry, thirst-quenching style, this saison is brewed to a much more sessionable ABV so you can drink a couple on a hot summer day without wiping yourself out.

Ingredients
6 lbs. (2.7 kg) Pilsner liquid malt extract
1 lb. (450 g) wheat malt
2.8 oz. (80 g) Caravienne malt
0.6 lb. (270 g) dextrose sugar
4.5 AAU Hallertau hops (60 min.) (0.88 oz./25 g at 4.5% alpha acids)
5.5 AAU Styrian Golding hops (30 min.) (0.88 oz./25 g at 5.5% alpha acids)
4 AAU Styrian Goldings (5 min.) (0.73 oz./20 g at 5.5% alpha acids)
Wyeast 3724 (Belgian Saison) or White Labs WLP565 (Saison Ale) or Safale BE-134 yeast
7⁄8 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by step

Start with 5 gallons (19 L) brewing water in your pot. Steep the crushed grains in a muslin bag as the water heats up to 170 °F (77 °C). Remove the grain bag, allowing the liquid to drip back into the pot. Remove from heat and stir in all the malt extract and dextrose. Turn heat back on once all the extract is dissolved and bring wort to a boil. Boil for 60 minutes, adding hops as indicated.

At the end of the boil, cool wort and ferment at around 77 °F (25 °C). If you do not have temperature control, any fermentation temperature between the yeast’s recommended 70–95 °F (21–35 °C) should work. When fermentation is complete, bottle or keg as usual.

Session Stout
Session Stout
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.044 FG = 1.010
IBU = 22 SRM = 31 ABV = 4.5%

An Americanized version of a dry Irish stout utilizing a simple malt bill with five specialty grains to create a full-bodied, quaffable session stout. Chocolate and roasted barley lead the charge for dark malts with a tad bit of black malt to balance the roast profile. C-120 adds notes of caramel to the body. Mashing at 156 °F (69 °C) will help the beer from drying completely out. The flaked barley builds the body up full and helps foam retention when pouring. The hops are subtle and balanced with a bright bittering addition of Warrior and finishing with the woody and spice-driven Willamette. Everything is meant to be harmonious and level to create a wonderfully easy-drinking stout!

Ingredients
7.5 lbs. (3.4 kg) 2-row pale malt (78.4%)
12 oz. (340 g) flaked barley (7.8%)
7 oz. (200 g) chocolate malt (4.6%)
7 oz. (200 g) roasted barley (4.6%)
3 oz. (85 g) black malt (2%)
4 oz. (113 g) crystal malt (120 °L) (2.6%)
5 AAU Warrior hops (60 min.) (0.33 oz./9 g at 15% alpha acids)
3.8 AAU Willamette hops (0 min.) (0.75 oz./21 g at 5% alpha acids)
1⁄2 tsp. yeast nutrient (10 min.)
1⁄2 Whirlfloc tablet (10 min.)
Wyeast 1056 (American Ale), Omega Yeast OYL-004 (West Coast Ale 1), or LalBrew BRY-97 (American West Coast Ale) yeast
2⁄3 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by step
If starting with soft or reverse osmosis water, add 4 g calcium carbonate per 5 gallons (19 L) of strike water.

Mash in, targeting to stabilize mash temperature at 156 °F (69 °C). Hold at this temperature for 45 minutes, then begin the lauter process. Sparge with enough water to collect 6.5 gallons (25 L) of wort in the kettle. Boil for 75 minutes, adding hops, nutrients, and kettle finings per the ingredients list. After the boil is complete, turn off heat, add the final hop addition, and then give the wort a long stir to create a whirlpool and let settle for 5 minutes.

Chill wort to 68 °F (20 °C), aerate well if using a liquid yeast strain, then pitch the yeast. Ferment at this temperature for two weeks. Transfer to a serving keg or bottle and prime with sugar targeting 2.3 volumes CO2.

Extract with grains option: Swap out the 2-row pale malt and flaked barley for 4.24 lbs. (2 kg) extra light dried malt extract and 4 oz. (113 g) dextrin malt. Steep crushed grains in 3 gallons (11.5 L) water as it heats up to 170 °F (77 °C). Remove grains, allowing liquid to drip back into the kettle. Add half the dried malt extract off heat. Once fully dissolved, bring wort to a boil for 60 minutes. Add hops, nutrients, and kettle finings per the ingredients list. After the boil is complete, turn off heat, add the final hop addition and the remaining extract, then give the wort a long stir to create a whirlpool and let settle for 5 minutes. Follow the remainder of the all-grain recipe, topping the fermenter up to 5 gallons (19 L) prior to pitching yeast.

Seven Bridges Organic IPA
Seven Bridges Organic IPA
(5 gallons/19 L, partial mash)
OG = 1.059–1.064 FG = 1.018–1.020
IBU = 11–26 SRM = 13 ABV = 5.3–5.7%

Ingredients
6 lbs. (2.7 kg) organic pale liquid malt extract
2.5 lbs. (1.1 kg) Briess organic pale 2-row malt
3/4 lbs. (0.34 kg) Briess organic Munich malt
1/2 lbs. (0.23 kg) Weyermann Carahell® malt
1/2 lbs. (0.23 kg) Briess organic caramel malt (60 °L)
1/2 teaspoon Irish moss
12.75 AAU New Zealand Pacific Gem hops (bittering) (0.75 oz./21 g of 17% alpha acids)
6 AAU organic English Kent Goldings leaf hops (flavor) (1.0 oz./28 g of 6% alpha acids)
8 AAU organic New Zealand Hallertaur hops (aroma) (1.0 oz./28 g of 8% alpha acids)
1 oz. (28 g) organic German Hallertauer Mittlefrueh hops (dry hop) (optional)
Wyeast 1968 (London ESB) or White Labs WLP023 (Burton Ale) yeast
8 oz. (0.23 g) (1 1/4 cups) organic dried malt extract (for bottling)

Step by step
Heat 1.75–2 gallons (6.6–7.6 L) of water to 160–165 °F (71–74 °C), then turn the heat off. Add the grain bag with grains in it and stir well. The temperature should drop to 150 °F (66 °C). Adjust the temperature if necessary by adding heat, hot water, or cold water. Allow the grains to soak for 40–60 minutes at 150 °F (66 °C). (Optional: Do a starch test to see if the partial mash is done — add a drop of iodine to a sample taken from the wort. If it turns black, the mash is not yet done). Heat 1 –1.5 gallons (3.8–5.7 L) of water to 170 °F (77 °C) in a separate pot. Sparge the grains with this water when the mash is complete. Add water to the liquid collected from the grains to make up to 5.25 gallons (20 L).

Heat the water to almost boiling and then turn the heat off. Add the malt extract and dissolve the extract completely. Turn the heat back on and bring to a boil. Once the wort has reached a rolling boil, add 3/4 oz. (21 g) organic New Zealand Pacific Gem hop pellets (bittering) and boil for 40 minutes. Add 1 oz. (28 g) organic English Kent Goldings hops. If desired, add the Irish moss flakes. Boil for 15 minutes more. Add 1 oz. (28 g) organic New Zealand Hallertaur hops (aroma), boil 5 more minutes and turn the heat off. Cool the wort to 65–75 °F (18–24 °C). Transfer the chilled wort into your sanitized primary fermenting vessel. Aerate the wort, add the yeast and ferment in a cool dark place for 4–7 days at 65-75 °F (18–24 °C) in the primary fermenter. If you have a secondary fermenter, transfer the beer to it when fermentation activity has subsided (after 4–6 days). If desired, add 1 oz. (28 g) Hallertauer Mittlefrueh hops to the secondary fermenter for dry hopping. Ferment for an additional 7–14 days, or until fermentation is complete. Bottle beer with 8 oz. (0.23 kg) or 1 1/4 cups organic dried malt extract. Store the beer at room temperature (about 70 °F/21 °C) for the first few days, then in a cool dark place (55–65 °F/13–18°C) for 1–3 weeks. Your beer is ready to drink when it is clear and nicely carbonated.

Shaun of the Red (Irish Red Ale)
(5 gallons/19 L, extract with grains)
OG = 1.060 FG = 1.015
IBU = 28 SRM = 13 ABV = 5.8%

Ingredients
2.5 lbs. (1.1 kg) light dried malt extract
4 lb. 6 oz. (2.0 kg) light liquid malt extract (late addition)
6.5 oz. (184 g) 2-row pale ale malt
1.0 lb. (0.45 kg) crystal malt (40 °L)
6 oz. (170 g) crystal malt (60 °L)
2 oz. (57 g) crystal malt (90 °L)
1.5 oz. (43 g) roasted barley (300 °L)
5.8 AAU Target hops (60 mins) (0.53 oz./15 g of 11% alpha acids)
2.5 AAU Kent Goldings hops (30 mins) (0.50 oz./14 g of 5% alpha acids)
0.25 oz. (7.1 g) Fuggles hops (5 mins)
1 tsp. Irish moss
Wyeast 1084 (Irish ale) or White Labs WLP004 (Irish ale) yeast (2 qt,/~2 L yeast starter)
0.75 cups corn sugar (for priming)

Step by Step
Place crushed grains in a nylon steeping bag. In a large kitchen pot, heat 3.0 qts. (2.8 L) of water to 161 °F (72 °C). Submerge grain bag in water and let steep at 150 °F (66 °C) for 45 minutes. (If temperature drops below 148 °F (64 °C), heat to 150 °F (66 °C) again.) While grains are steeping, heat 1.5 qts. (~1.5 L) of water to 170 °F (77 °C) in a sauce pan. Also, begin heating 2 gallons (7.6 L) of water to a boil in your brewpot. When steeping is done, place a colander over your brewpot and lift the grain bag into it. Pour the "grain tea" through the bag (which will strain out most of the grain bits), then rinse the bag with the 1.5 qts. (~1.5 L) of 170
°F (77 °C) water.

Heat the (roughly) 3 gallons (11 L) of wort in your brewpot to a boil, then stir in dried malt extract. (It will foam a bit, so don’t pour all the extract in at once.) Bring the wort back to a boil, add the Target hops and boil for 60 minutes. Add the Kent Goldings hops with 30 minutes left in the boil. Add liquid malt extract, and Irish moss with 15 minutes left in boil. Add Fuggles 5 minutes before the end of the boil.

After the boil, put a lid on your brewpot and cool the wort (either in a cold-water bath in your sink or with a wort chiller). Cool until
the side of the brewpot no longer feels warm. Transfer wort to your fermenter and top up to 5.25 gallons (20 L) with cool water. Aerate the wort and pitch your yeast. Ferment at 68 °F (20 °F). When fermentation slows to halt, rack to secondary. Bottle with corn sugar (or keg) one week later.

IBU = 24 SRM = 24 ABV = 3.2%

It is rare for me to brew the exact same recipe twice; I tend to make tweaks and adjustments even to ones I like. But I brew this recipe every late spring in time for session drinking over the summer
because I love it so much.

*Please note that this recipe is for 5 gallons (19 L), as is standard for BYO.
If you want to fill a pin-sized cask, I suggest increasing the quantities by 10%.
If you want to fill a pressure barrel, increase the quantities by 20%.

Ingredients
5.7 lbs. (2.6 kg) Maris Otter pale ale malt
1 lb. (454 g) medium crystal malt (60 °L)
7.6 oz. (215 g) chocolate malt (425 °L)
4.7 AAU First Gold hops (60 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 9.5% alpha acids)
3.6 AAU Tettnang hops (15 min.) (1.1 oz./31 g at 3.4% alpha acids)
1⁄2 tsp. (0.6 g) Irish moss
Silica sol
7.2 fl. oz. (213 mL) isinglass (optional)
SafAle S-04 or your favorite English ale yeast
0.9 oz. (25 g) sugar

Step by step
Mash all of the malt at around 152 °F (67 °C) for one hour. Collect 6 gallons (23 L) of wort in the kettle and boil for one hour, adding the First Gold hops after 15 minutes, and then the Tettnang hops and Irish moss after 45 minutes. At the end of the boil, chill to 68 °F (20 °C) and then transfer to your fermenter and pitch the yeast. After five days, add the silica sol fining according to the manufacturer’s instructions and then chill to 41 °F (5 °C) or below for two days. If filling a single container (e.g. a pin cask or pressure barrel), dissolve the sugar in the smallest amount of boiled water as you can, add this to the container and then rack the beer onto it. Add the isinglass (if using for the purpose of clarification) directly to the container while the beer is being racked. Seal the container and condition at 68 °F (20 °C) for at least two weeks before serving.

Ingredients
4 lbs. (1.8 kg) Maris Otter liquid malt extract
1 lb. (454 g) medium crystal malt (60 °L)
8 oz. (230 g) chocolate malt (425 °L)
4.7 AAU First Gold hops (60 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 9.5% alpha acids)
3.6 AAU Tettnang hops (15 min.) (1.1 oz./31 g at 3.4% alpha acids)

Silica sol
7.2 fl. oz. (213 mL) isinglass (optional)
SafAle S-04 or your favorite English ale yeast
0.9 oz. (25 g) sugar

Step by step
Place caramel and chocolate malt into a steeping bag and submerge in 6 gallons (23 L) of water at or near 155 °F (68 °C). After 20 minutes of steeping, remove the grain bag, then bring the wort up to a boil. When boil is achieved, take the kettle off the flame and add the extract while stirring. Once extract is fully dissolved return to the heat source and boil for 60 minutes, adding the hops as indicated.

At the end of the boil, chill to 68 °F (20 °C) and then transfer to your fermenter and pitch the yeast. After five days, add the silica sol fining according to the manufacturer’s instructions and then chill to 41 °F (5 °C) or below for two days. If filling a single container (e.g. a pin cask or pressure barrel), dissolve the sugar in the smallest amount of boiled water as you can, add this to the container and then rack the beer onto it. Add the isinglass (if using for the purpose of clarification) directly to the container while the beer is being racked. Seal the container and condition at 68 °F (20 °C) for at least two weeks before serving.

Tips for success:
Anyone who is vegan will want to know that isinglass is obtained from bladders of fish. Sadly, isinglass is pretty essential if people want their beer to be crystal clear in 24 hours. As much as I wish silica sol could do this on its own, experience tells me that it simply doesn’t (I’m actually vegan and have spent the last three years trying to find a good way of replacing isinglass in casks and so far I have failed). The addition of isinglass is optional but not using it may result in hazy beer.

Place the crushed pale rye malt and flaked rye in one grain bag and the crystal rye malt, Cararye® and chocolate malt in a second grain bag. Bring 1.55 gallons (5.7 L) of water to approximately 162 °F (73 °C) and submerge the first grain bag in the water. Try to hold the mash temperature at 152 °F (67 °C) for 45 minutes. Add the second grain bag and let steep for an additional 15 minutes. Remove both grain bags, place them in a colander, and wash with 1 gallon (4 L) hot water. Add liquid extract while wort is off heat and stir until completely dissolved. Top off the kettle to 6.5 gallons (24.6 L) and bring to a boil. Boil for 90 minutes, adding hops according to the ingredient list.
After the boil and a whirlpool, chill the wort to slightly below fermentation temperature, about 66 °F (19 °C). Aerate with pure oxygen or filtered air and pitch yeast.
Follow the same fermentation and packaging instructions as the all-grain version.

TIPS FOR SUCCESS:
This is a beer that asks a lot of both its malt and its hops, so pay particular attention to your water chemistry! If you have particularly chloride- or sulfate-heavy (or deficient!) water, consider diluting or adjusting to reach an average and balanced amount of each, which will help prevent either aggressive bitterness or dull maltiness.

6 oz. (170 g) carapils® malt
12 oz. (0.34 kg) Munich malt
4 oz. (113 g) crystal malt (60 °L)
12 oz. (0.34 kg) crystal malt (80 °L)
2 oz. (57 g) roasted barley (450 °L)
3.4 AAU Cascade hop pellets (60 min.) (0.65 oz./18 g at 5.25% alpha acids)
2.6 AAU Cascade hop pellets (30 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 5.25% alpha acids)
1.3 AAU Cascade hop pellets (5 min.) (0.25 oz./7 g at 5.25% alpha acids)
1⁄2 tsp. yeast nutrient (15 min.)
1⁄2 tsp. Irish moss (30 min.)
White Labs WLP 013 (London Ale) or Wyeast 1028 (London Ale) yeast
3/4 cup (150 g) dextrose (if bottling)

Step by Step
This is a single step infusion mash. Mix the crushed grains with 3.75 gallons (14 L) of 168 °F (76 °C) water to stabilize at 150 °F (66 °C) for 60 minutes. Sparge slowly with 175 °F (79 °C) water. Collect approximately 6 gallons (27.3 L) of wort runoff to boil for 60 minutes. Cool the wort to 75 °F (24 °C). Pitch the yeast and aerate heavily. Ferment at 68 °F (20 °C). Transfer to a carboy, avoiding any splashing. Condition for one week and then bottle or keg.

IBU = 25 SRM = 30 ABV = 5.2%

A black blonde? Why not? One evening after a scrumptious lemon-rosemary chicken meal prepared by my wife, Raven, we got to talking about what kind of beer would go with lemon and rosemary and this recipe was the result. The original version of this recipe appeared in the JAN/FEB 2006 issue of Brew Your Own.
Ingredients
9.1 lbs. (4.1 kg) 2-row malt
12 oz. (336 g) white wheat malt
10 oz. (280 g) Vienna malt
1.25 lbs. (0.57 kg) roasted barley (cold steeped)
5.8 AAU Wakatu pellet hops (45 min.) (0.83 oz./23 g at 7% alpha acids)
2.9 AAU Wakatu pellet hops (10 min.) (0.42 oz./12 g at 7% alpha acid)
1/2 tsp. Irish moss (15 min.)
1/4 tsp. yeast nutrient (15 min.)
White Labs WLP008 (East Coast Ale) or Wyeast 1098 (British Ale) yeast
1 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
This is a single infusion mash. On brew day, mash the crushed 2-row, white wheat and crystal Vienna malts at a 1.5 quarts to 1 pound ratio of strike water (3.1 L/kg) at 152 °F (67 °C) for 60 minutes. Vorlauf until wort runs clear. Sparge with enough water to collect about 6.25 gallons (24 L) of wort in the kettle. Boil for a total of 45 minutes, adding the hops, Irish moss, and yeast nutrients per the recipe.

Chill the wort to pitching temperature, rack to fermenting vessel, and pitch yeast. Ferment for 2 weeks in the 67–69 °F (19-21 °C) range. On day 13, make the roasted barley coloring extract by steeping 1.25 lbs. (567 g) of crushed roasted barley in 2 qts. (2 L) water. On day 14, separate the grain from the coloring extract and boil the extract for 10 minutes. Once cooled to room temperature, add the coloring extract to the fermenter then proceed to package the beer with priming sugar and bottle or keg and force carbonate as normal.

Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.’s Hoppy Anniversary Ale clone
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.056 FG = 1.011
IBU = 65 SRM = 6 ABV = 6.0%

A tribute to the best of the West Coast IPAs, and craft beer’s long strange journey, Hoppy Anniversary Ale can be considered both a celebration and an autobiography of the craft beer movement. It features Cascade, Centennial, and Cluster hops —three critical hops in the early days of America’s craft beer business.

Ingredients
10 lbs. (4.5 kg) North American Pilsner malt
1 lb. (0.45 kg) malted oats (with hull)
0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) caramel/crystal malt (60 °L)
5.75 AAU Cascade hops (85 min.) (1 oz./28 g at 5.75% alpha acids)
7 AAU Cluster hops (85 min.) (1 oz./28 g at 7% alpha acids)
4.3 AAU Cascade hops (10 min.) (0.75 oz./21 g at 5.75% alpha acids)
8.6 AAU Cascade hops (0 min.) (1.5 oz./43 g at 5.75% alpha acids)
15 AAU Centennial hops (0 min.) (1.5 oz./43 g at 10% alpha acids)
1 oz. (28 g) Cascade hops (dry hop)
1 oz. (28 g) Centennial hops (dry hop)
1 Whirlfloc tablet
1⁄2 tsp. yeast nutrient
Wyeast 1056 (American Ale), White Labs WLP001 (California Ale), or SafAle US-05 yeast
3⁄4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by step
Achieve a mash temperature of 154 °F (68 °C) and hold for 60 minutes or until fully converted. After mash is complete, raise temperature to 168–170 °F (76–77 °C) for mashout and about a 10-minute recirculation. Begin collecting your wort and sparge with 170 °F (77 °C) water acidulated to a pH at or near 5.2.

Boil for 90 minutes, adding the first hop additions five minutes into the boil. With 10 minutes to go in the boil, add 1⁄2 tsp. of yeast nutrient and a Whirlfloc tablet to help with beer clarity.

At the end of the boil, whirlpool for 10 minutes after adding the flameout hops. Then chill rapidly to 68 °F (20 °C) and oxygenate thoroughly. Fermentation should last 4–5 days, then allow another 9–10 days for conditioning. Add your dry hops on or around day 10. Upon completion of the fermentation cycle (about two weeks after brew day), chill the beer to 38 °F (3 °C) and keg. Chilling the beer first will help pull dry hop matter out of suspension, producing a cleaner beer. Carbonate to 2.5 v/v or prime and bottle condition.

Ingredients
5.5 lbs. (2.5 kg) Pilsen dried malt extract
1 lb. (0.45 kg) malted oats (with hull)
0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) caramel/crystal malt (60 °L)
5.75 AAU Cascade hops (85 min.) (1 oz./28 g at 5.75% alpha acids)
7 AAU Cluster hops (85 min.) (1 oz./28 g at 7% alpha acids)
4.3 AAU Cascade hops (10 min.) (0.75 oz./21 g at 5.75% alpha acids)
8.6 AAU Cascade hops (0 min.) (1.5 oz./43 g at 5.75% alpha acids)
15 AAU Centennial hops (0 min.) (1.5 oz./43 g at 10% alpha acids)
1 oz. (28 g) Cascade hops (dry hop)
1 oz. (28 g) Centennial hops (dry hop)

1⁄2 tsp. yeast nutrient
Wyeast 1056 (American Ale), White Labs WLP001 (California Ale), or SafAle US-05 yeast
3⁄4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by step
Heat 3 qts. (2.8 L) of water to around 160 °F (71 °C). Take the pot off the flame and put the oats and crystal malt into a grain bag and add into the water at this time. Try to hold the grains at 154 °F (68 °C) for roughly 45–60 minutes. Place the grains in a colander and wash with 1 gallon (3.8 L) warm water. Top up to 3 gallons (11 L) then slowly add the extract while stirring continuously until all extract is dissolved. Add heat and bring to a boil. Boil for 60 minutes, adding the hops as indicated.

In the meantime, prepare 2–2.5 gallons (7.6–9.5 L) of water to add to your wort to top up after boil is complete. To be safe, it’s best to boil that water, then chill it, to ensure elimination of any contaminants in the water.

Upon conclusion of the boil, chill rapidly to 68 °F (20 °C), add the pre-chilled water to top up, pitch yeast and oxygenate thoroughly. Fermentation at 68 °F (20 °C) should last 4–5 days, then allow another 9–10 days for conditioning. Add your dry hops on or around day 10. Upon completion of the fermentation cycle (about two weeks after brew day), chill the beer to 38 °F (3 °C) and keg. This will help pull dry hop matter out of suspension, producing a cleaner beer. Carbonate to 2.5 v/v or prime and bottle condition.

Ingredients
12.5 lbs. (5.7 kg) Rahr 2-row pale malt
1.25 lbs. (0.57 kg) Crisp crystal malt (60 °L)
8 AAU Centennial hops (80 min.) (0.8 oz./23 g at 10% alpha acids)
8 AAU Centennial hops (15 min.) (0.8 oz./23 g at 10% alpha acids)
5.6 AAU Cascade hops (15 min.) (0.8 oz./23 g at 7% alpha acids)
5 AAU Centennial hops (0 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 10% alpha acids)
3.5 AAU Cascade hops (0 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 7% alpha acids)
0.5 oz. (14 g) Centennial hops (dry hop)
0.5 oz. (14 g) Cascade hops (dry hop)
Imperial Yeast A24 (Dry Hop) or similar yeast blend such as White Labs WLP644 (Saccharomyces "Bruxellensis" Trois) blended with White Labs WLP095 (Burlington Ale) strains
3⁄4 cups (150 g) dextrose (if priming)

Step by Step
Crush the malt and add to 4.3 gallons (16.3 L) strike water to achieve a stable mash temperature at 152 °F (67 °C) until enzymatic conversion is complete. Sparge slowly with 168 °F (76 °C) water, collecting wort until the pre-boil kettle volume is 6.5 gallons (24.6 L). Boil the wort for 80 minutes, adding the hops as indicated. After the boil is finished, cool the wort to 200 °F (82 °C) and then add the hop stand addition. Stir the wort to create a whirlpool, then let settle for 20 minutes before chilling the wort down to yeast-pitching temperature. Now transfer to the fermenter, aerate the wort, and pitch the yeast. Ferment at 60–62 °F (16–17 °C). As the kräusen begins to fall, typically day four or five, add the dry hops to the fermenter and let the beer sit on the hops for four days. Bottle with priming sugar or keg and force carbonate to 2.4 volumes CO2.

Extract with grains option:
Replace the 2-row pale malt in the all-grain recipe with 6.6 lbs. (3 kg) extra light dried malt extract. Place the crushed malt in a muslin bag. Steep the grains in 5 gallon (23 L) of water at 160 °F (71 °C) for 20 minutes. Remove the grain bag and wash with 2 qts. (2 L) of hot water. Top off the kettle to 6.5 gallons (24.6 L) and heat up to boil. As soon as the water begins to boil, remove the brew pot from the heat and stir in the dried malt extract. Stir until all the extract is dissolved then return the wort to a boil. Boil the wort for 80 minutes adding hops at the times indicated. Follow the remaining steps found above in the all-grain recipe.

Our Apple Spiced Ale has captured Autumn in a glass. Subtle spices combine with apple flavor in a malty, warming seasonal brew. The addition of maple syrup just adds another layer of flavoring to an already multi-faceted beer. Adding maple syrup will increase original gravity, color, and ABV.

Ingredients
11.5 lbs. (5.2 g) British 2-row pale malt
9 oz. (252 g) US crystal malt (40 °L)
1 oz. (28 g) British chocolate malt

2 vanilla bean splits (1/2-inch)
1 tsp. ground cinnamon
1/4 oz. (7 g) freshly grated ginger root
1 tsp. Irish moss
Wyeast 1098 (British Ale) yeast
1 1/4 cups Muntons extra light dry malt extract for priming
4–6 oz. (112–168 g) pure apple flavoring for priming
*optional 8 oz. (224 g) maple syrup

Step by Step
Mash grains at 154 °F (68 °C) for 90 minutes. Mash in 4 gallons (15.2 L) of water, sparge with 5 gallons (19 L) of 168 °F (76 °C) water. There should be 7 gallons (26.6 L) at the start of the boil.

Add 5.7 AAU Northern Brewer bittering hops to boil for 60 minutes. Add 1 tsp. Irish moss, 1/2-inch vanilla bean split, 1/2 tsp. ground cinnamon, 1/4 oz. (7 g) freshly grated ginger peel, 8 oz. (224 g) pure maple syrup (optional) to boil for 15 minutes. Add 1/2 inch vanilla bean split, 1/2 tsp. ground cinnamon, and 1/2 oz. freshly grated ginger peel to boil for 3 minutes.

Pitch Wyeast 1098 British Ale to inoculate fermentation at 68-70 °F (20-21 °C). Prime with 1-1/4 cups Muntons extra light malt extract that has been boiled for 10 minutes in 2 cups of water and 4-6 oz. (112-168 g) apple flavor and bottle. Age at cellar temperature until brew suits your taste.

Ingredients
3.3 lbs. (1.5 kg) Pilsen liquid malt extract
2.25 lbs. (1.0 kg) Pilsen dried malt extract
1.5 lb. (0.7 kg) German dark Munich malt (15 ºL)
1.0 lb. (0.45 kg) German Munich malt (10 ºL)
1 tsp. Irish moss (15 mins)
4.75 AAU Hallertau Hersbrücker hops (60 min.) (1.0 oz./28 g of 4.75% alpha acids)
2.4 AAU Hallertau Hersbrücker hops (10 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g of 4.75% alpha acid)
White Labs WLP820 (Oktoberfest/Märzen Lager) or Wyeast 2308 (Munich Lager) yeast
0.75 cup corn sugar (for priming)

Step by Step
Steep the 2 crushed Munich malts in 3 gallons (11 L) of water at 150 ºF (66 ºC) for 30 minutes. Remove grains from wort, add the malt syrup and dry malt extract and bring to a boil. Add the first addition of Hallertau Hersbrücker hops, Irish moss, and boil for 60 minutes. Add the last addition of Hallertau Hersbrücker hops for the last 10 minutes of the boil. Now add wort to 2 gallons (7.6 L) cool water in a sanitary fermenter, and top off with cool water to 5.5 gallons (20.9 L). Cool the wort to 75 ºF (24 ºC), aerate the beer and pitch your yeast. Allow the beer to cool over the next few hours to 68 °F (20 ºC) and hold at this temperature until the yeast has started fermenting. Then cool to 50 °F (10 ºC) until finished fermentation. Sin City then does a diacetyl rest by warming the beer to 70 °F (21 ºC) for 4 days. Then rack the beer to a secondary and cool the beer again to 50 ºF (10 ºC) for another four days. Finally, Sin City lagers the beer at near freezing for another two weeks.

1 oz. (28 g) Citra® hops (dry hop)
Omega OYL-052 (DIPA Ale) or GigaYeast GY054 (Vermont IPA) or LalBrew New England yeast
¾ cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Mill the grains, then mix with 17.8 qts. (16.86 L) of 167 °F (75 °C) strike water to achieve a single infusion rest temperature of 152 °F (67 °C). Hold at this temperature for 60 min.
Vorlauf until your runnings are clear before directing them to your boil kettle. Batch or fly sparge the mash with 4 gallons (15 L) and top up as necessary to obtain 6.5 gallons (25 L) of wort. Add the corn sugar. Boil for 60 minutes, adding hops at the times indicated above left in the boil.

After the boil and 20-minute whirlpool, rapidly chill the wort to slightly below fermentation temperature, which is 68 °F (20 °C) for this beer. Pitch yeast.

Maintain fermentation temperature to avoid fusels and unwanted esters. When primary fermentation is near but not yet complete, add the dry hops. Two days later, toast the coconut at 350 °F (175 °C) for a few minutes until you see a change in its appearance. Pull it out of the oven and let it cool before bagging it and placing it in the fermenter. Let it steep in the beer for 2 days; this will give the dry hops 4 days to work their magic. Bottle or keg the beer and carbonate to approximately 2.5 volumes.

Bring 6.5 gallons (25 L) of water to a boil. Turn off heat and add the dried extracts while stirring to avoid clumps and continue until completely dissolved. Return to heat and boil for 60 minutes, adding hops at the indicated times left in the boil.

Follow the all-grain recipe for post-boil, fermentation, coconut addition, and packaging instructions for the beer.

Tips for Success:
This beer is very hop-forward and as such you’ll want to use the freshest hops you can get your hands on. The alpha acid percentages were chosen simply to help with AAU calculations but you should mainly focus on the weight amounts of each in the late addition hops; there will be enough IBUs to balance the beer. Finally, like any beer but especially IPAs, you should attempt to minimize oxygen contact with the finished product as it will destroy your well-crafted hop profile faster than you can say "Oxidation!!" Consider a keg with a closed transfer if you have a draft system.

My brother went to Scotland for a year. I brewed this Scotch ale the day he left and conditioned it for the year he was gone.

Ingredients
18 lbs. (8.2 kg) Crisp pale malt
2.5 lbs. (1.1 kg) crystal malt
0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) chocolate malt
0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) biscuit malt
0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) caramel malt
8.5 AAU Brewers Gold hops (60 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 8.5% alpha acids)
Heather, juniper or elderberry (10 min.)
White Labs WLP028 (Edinburough Ale) or Wyeast 1728 (Scottish Ale) yeast

Step by Step
Mash at 153 °F (67 °C) for 60 minutes. Total boil time is 90 minutes. Add the hops at 60 minutes. Add heather, juniper, or elderberry in the last 10 minutes. I often add various aromatic herbs or hops at the "whirl" or chilling point (either/or with the herbs in the last 10 minutes of the boil) and let them steep as the wort cools down and the trub settles out. Chill to 70 °F (21 °C), pitch the yeast and ferment at 55–75 °F (13–24 °C). After primary fermentation is complete, rack to conditioning vessel. Leave in a cool dark place for as long as you can stand it. Bottle/carbonate and enjoy with friends.

Extract option:
Omit pale malt. Steep grains in 5.5 qts. (5.2 L) of water at 153 °F (67 °C) for 45 minutes. Add water to make 3 gallons (11 L). Stir in 4.25 lbs. (1.9 kg) light dried malt extract and bring to a boil. Boil 60 minutes, adding hops and spices at times indicated. Stir in 6.6 lbs (3.0 kg) Muntons Light liquid malt extract for the final 15 minutes. Ferment at 55–75 °F (13–24 °C).

Hop Classic is a full-flavored Belgian IPA with bitterness well-integrated in true Belgian style, featuring a pleasant kick at the end. Super refreshing on the palate with apricot, citrus, and floral notes. Inspired by De Ranke XX Bitter, Hop Classic was created as a homage to the nouveau classic of Belgium brewing. It is a simple recipe but very complex beer with the malt bill allowing the yeast and classic noble hop character to shine through.

With a 1.2 qts./lb. (2.5 L/kg) water-to-grist ratio, conduct a protein rest at 131 °F (55 °C), holding for 10 minutes. Raise the mash temperature to 145 °F (63 °C) and hold for 40 minutes for beta amylase rest. Perform final alpha amylase rest of the step mash by raising the temperature to 161 °F (72 °C) for 10 minutes or until enzymatic conversion is complete. Batch or fly sparge with 176 °F (80 °C) water to collect 7 gallons (26.5L) of wort in the kettle.

Boil for 60 minutes, adding hops and fining agent as indicated. Rapidly chill the wort at flameout to 65 °F (18 °C) and transfer to primary fermenter. Aerate thoroughly and pitch plenty of healthy yeast. Ferment at 70 °F (21 °C) until terminal gravity of 1.004 is reached, usually within 7 to 10 days. Crash cool the beer to 39 °F (4 °C) and lager for 4 weeks.

Rack beer off of the yeast into a keg and force carbonate targeting 2.6 volumes of CO2 or prime and bottle condition, leaving the bottles at 70–75 °F (21–24 °C) for two weeks to properly condition.

A malty English Scottish Strong Red Ale.

Ingredients
1.5 lbs. (0.68 kg) amber dried malt extract
11 lbs. (5 kg) 2-row pale malt
1 lb. 6 oz. (0.62 kg) Carapils® malt
1 lb. 4 oz. (0.57 kg) caramel malt (80 °L)
0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) caramel malt (120 °L)
0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) red wheat malt
10 AAU German Tradition hops (80 min.) (2.25 oz./62 g at 4.5% alpha acids)
7 AAU Crystal hops (30 min.) (2 oz./57 g at 3.5% alpha acids)
1.5 oz. (43 g) Willamette hops (5 min.)
1 oz. (28 g) Cascade hops (0 min.)
White Labs WLP007 (Dry English Ale) or Wyeast 1098 (British Ale) or Lallemand Nottingham yeast
¾ cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Mash the grains at 154 °F (68 °C) for 45 minutes and recirculate for 15 minutes before kettle run-off. Add amber dried malt extract to achieve desired gravity. (This can be dropped completely, it is included in this recipe because some systems have a hard time achieving the desired pre-boil gravity with this much grain.) Boil 90 minutes and wait for hot break before first hop addition, hence the "80 minute." Follow the hopping schedule and cool to fermenter. Pitch yeast and ferment at 69 °F (21 °C). After final gravity is met, drop from fermentation temperature in stages down to 45 °F (7.2 °C), then drop yeast and cold condition the beer at 35 °F (1.7 °C) for the last few days before packaging. Add priming sugar or force carbonate to 2.5 volumes of CO2. If fining, Ska recommends Biofine® Clear to insure the beer is vegan, but isinglass will also do the trick.

Extract with grains option:
Substitute the 2-row pale malt and Carapils® in the all-grain recipe with 3 lbs. (1.4 kg) light dried malt extract and 4 lbs. (1.8 kg) light liquid malt extract. Place crushed grains in a steeping bag and steep in 3 qts. (2.9 L) of water at 154 °F (68 °C) for 45 minutes. Remove grain bag and rinse with 1.5 qt. (1.4 L) of water at 170 °F (77 °C). Add water to "grain tea" to make 3.5 gallons (13 L), stir in both dried malt extracts and bring to a boil. Boil for 90 minutes, adding hops as soon as the hot break appears. Keep a small pot of boiling water handy and do not let boil volume drop below 3 gallons (11 L). Stir in liquid malt extract during final 15 minutes of the boil, stirring constantly until extract has dissolved completely. Add flavor and aroma hops according to schedule. Follow the remaining portion of the all-grain recipe.

IBU = 84 SRM = 50 ABV = 9.3%

Smog City’s winter seasonal double chocolate stout is named for the character, The Nothing, from the movie The Neverending Story. It is aged on raw cocoa nibs and should have the flavor of a high-quality, dark chocolate bar.

Ingredients
6.5 lbs. (3 kg) Maris Otter pale ale malt
6 lbs. (2.7 kg) Rahr 2-row pale malt
2 lbs. (0.9 kg) flaked oats
1 lb. (0.45 kg) flaked barley
0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) chocolate wheat malt (375 °L)
0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) medium crystal malt (60 °L)
0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) Crisp crystal malt (120 °L)
0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) pale chocolate malt
0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) roasted barley
0.25 lb. (113 g) Carafa® III Special malt
0.25 lb. (113 g) dark brown sugar (90 min.)
22.5AAU Summit hops (90 min.) (1.25 oz./35 g at 18% alpha acid)
0.7 oz. (20g) Tcho Ecuador cocoa nibs (crushed)
0.7 oz. (20g) Tcho Ghana cocoa nibs (crushed)
Wyeast 1056 (American Ale) or White Labs WLP001 (California Ale) or Safale US-05 yeast
2/3 cup (133 g) dextrose (if priming)

Step by Step
Mill the grains, then mix with 5.7 gallons (21.6 L) of 165 °F (74 °C) strike water to reach a mash temperature of 152 °F (67 °C). Hold this temperature for 60 minutes. Vorlauf until your runnings are clear, and sparge. Sparge the grains with enough water to obtain 7 gallons (26.5 L) of wort. Boil for 90 minutes, adding hops and sugar according to the ingredient list and Irish moss if desired.

After the boil, chill the wort to slightly below fermentation temperature, about 65 °F (18 °C). Aerate the wort with pure oxygen or filtered air and pitch yeast.

Ferment at 66 °F (19 °C) for seven days, then free rise to 72 °F (22 °C) until the completion of primary fermentation. Add the crushed cocoa nibs to a neutral spirit such as vodka and let soak for 1 week or more. Once the beer completes fermentation, reduce temperature to 32 °F (0 °C), and add the cocoa nibs with spirits, resting for 10-14 days. Then bottle or keg the beer and carbonate to approximately 2.25 volumes.

Partial Mash Option:
Substitute the Maris Otter pale ale malt with 6.6 lbs. (3 kg) Maris Otter liquid malt extract, and scale the Rahr 2-row pale malt down to 3 lbs. (1.4 kg). Bring 11 quarts (10.4 L) of water to approximately 165 °F (74 °C). Place crushed 2-row malt, flaked oats and barley in a large grain bag. Submerge in water, stirring the grains to making sure there are no dry clumps. Steep grains for 45 minutes, trying to maintain the temperature at 152 °F (67 °C). Place the crushed crystal and dark roasted malts in a second grain bag, submerge in the mash. Wait an additional 15 minutes, then remove both bags and place in a colander over the kettle. Slowly wash the grains with 2 gallons hot water. Add liquid extract while stirring, and stir until completely dissolved. Top up to 7 gallons (26.5 L) and boil for 90 minutes, adding hops and sugar according to the ingredient list and Irish moss if desired. Now follow the remainder of the all-grain recipe.

Tips for Success
Head Brewmaster Jonathan Porter passed on that the first time they brewed The Nothing it took 11 hours to lauter! Now, they mash in all of the base malt first, then add the dark and specialty malts on top of the grain bed. If you’re concerned about a stuck lauter or sparge (what with all of the wheat, flaked barley, and oats), you can take this approach and/or add a pound of rice hulls to ease the process.

Porter also noted that the flavor target here is similar to a really fine dark chocolate bar, with an aroma of rich dark cocoa powder. To achieve that, ingredients matter: be sure to source the best cocoa nibs you can find and be sure to avoid going overboard on the chocolate/black malts.

Step by Step
For the partial mash adaptation of this recipe, you will need a 3.0-gallon (11-L) beverage cooler (with a spigot) and a grain bag capable of holding 6.0 lbs. (2.7 kg) of grain. Place crushed grains in the large steeping bag and place in the cooler. Heat 8.2 qts. (7.8 L) of water to 161 °F (72 °C) and stir into grains so that the temperature hits 149–150 °F (65–66 °C). Place lid on cooler and hold at this temperature for 60 minutes. Collect wort and sparge with 190 °F
(88 °C) water by drawing off 2–3 cups (470–710 mL) of wort and adding it to your brewpot, then gently pouring the same amount of hot water to the top of the grain bed in the cooler. Repeat until you have collected 3.0–3.5 gallons (11–13 L) of wort. Add first wort hops (FWH) while collecting wort. Add roughly half of the malt extract and boil wort for 90 minutes. (Keep some boiling water handy and don’t let the boil volume dip below 3.0 gallons/11 L.) Add hops at times indicated and carefully stir in remaining malt extract in final 15 minutes of the boil. Cool wort quickly to 65 °F (18 °C) and pitch yeast. Let temperature raise naturally to between 68 and 70 °F (20–21 °C) and hold. This beer should take 7 to 10 days to complete and then rack to secondary for a week to ten days. Keg at 10 PSI or bottle with 1 cup of corn sugar in 750 mL corked and hooded bottles. This beer will age well for years or can be consumed in a few weeks after bottling.

Tips for Success
When making a dark beer, water chemistry can make the difference between a beer that seems too acidic and one in which the roasted flavors taste pleasant. If you were starting from distilled water, adding 0.25 oz. (7.1 g) of calcium carbonate (chalk) and 0.25 oz. (7.1 g) of sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) per 5 gallons (19 L) of brewing liquor (brewing water) would benefit this beer. (If you have a pH meter, check the mash pH. It should fall between 5.2 and 5.6.)

Also, as with any big beer, thorough wort aeration, adding some yeast nutrients in the boil and making a yeast starter will yield a better fermentation.

Smoked Maple Brown Ale

"Kick Save, and a Beauty..."

by Scott R. Russell 

I had a fairly athletic upbringing. All of my male relatives were sports fans, and I can’t remember ever not being one myself. My great-grandmother would read me the sports pages when I was very young, and my grandmother was a huge hockey fan. I went to Red Sox baseball games starting at the age of 4 or 5, and family gatherings frequently revolved around watching football, basketball, baseball games, golf tournaments, and so forth.

Of course we all played sports, too. No summer cookout was complete without a whiffle-ball game, fall gatherings included touch football, and there was always a golf outing on the mornings of Memorial Day and the Fourth of July. But, no matter how I tried, I just couldn’t ice skate. I blame it on weak ankles, the kind that flop over sideways after about five minutes propped up on thin metal blades. I always ended up with exhausted and painful feet. My great invention and contribution to mankind was always going to be skates with a second blade set at a 90° angle to the main blade, facing outward, like the outrigger canoes on "Hawaii 5-0."

I loved hockey, still do. Thursday night was hockey night in our house, because that was the night Mom was at choir rehearsal. My dad and I (my brother and sister were too young to stay up that late!) would turn on Channel 38 and watch the Bruins together every Thursday. Bobby Orr, Phil Esposito, Bucyk, Hodge, MacKenzie...heroes of a generation.

So when the guys in the neighborhood would gather at the local pond to play hockey, I was the proverbial Last Kid Picked. And often, because I couldn’t skate, I’d get stuck playing goalie. No mask, no gloves, no big wide goaltender’s stick, just skinny little me, a regular hockey stick, and if I was lucky, mittens that were not soaking wet.

My epiphany came one gloomy afternoon when I saved a game by accident. With time running out, a long booming shot came down the ice at me and I fell. But I fell with my legs out in the direction of the flying puck and knocked it aside to a teammate, and we won. The kid doing the play-by-play on the sideline (there was always someone doing play-by-play on the sideline...) yelled out, imitating the TV announcer, "Kick save, and a beauty..." and, well, my teammates didn’t mob me, but they didn’t give me the traditional whitewashing either...

This was the voice I heard in my mind a couple of winters ago, when I almost burned down my house, and worse, almost ruined a batch of beer. It was sugaring season, and I had been boiling maple sap on the porch for hours. I had reduced 60 or 70 gallons of sap down to about a gallon and a half of thick amber sweet glue. And then I forgot about it, got doing something else inside, and left it still boiling. I smelled burnt sugar, smoke, and in a panic ran out to the porch to find my pan now filled with almost solid, burnt maple toffee. A few more minutes, and I bet it would have burst into flames.

I did the logical thing, what you all would have done in my place, right? I turned off the heat and poured water into the pan, to reconstitute the syrup. But boy did it taste burnt. No longer fit for human consumption. Not on pancakes, at least. But not wanting to waste it — after all, there were 70 gallons of sap and five or six pounds of propane invested in it — I concocted a recipe for an old ale, which would use the burnt syrup instead of molasses or treacle. It is now three years old, and the burnt sugar and smoky maple are wonderful.

Now, I don’t want to encourage anyone to go out and evaporate 70 gallons of fresh maple sap, and then burn it, to duplicate my brewing version of a"kick save." Instead, I offer a recipe for a stronger-than-average brown ale, with a small amount of smoked grain and some maple, to give you an idea of what it might have been...

Kick Save Smoked Maple Brown Ale
(5 gallons/19 L, partial mash)
OG = 1.068 FG = 1.015
IBU = 22 SRM = 26 ABV = 7.4%

Ingredients
4 lbs. (1.8 kg) pale malt
1 lb. (0.45 kg) brown malt
0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) dark crystal malt (90° L)
0.25 lb. (113 g) chocolate malt
2 oz. (57 g) German rauchmalt (beechwood smoked malt)
3 lbs. (1.4 kg) amber dried malt extract
1 qt. (1 L) pure maple syrup
4 AAU Styrian Goldings hops (75 min.) (0.8 oz./23 g at 5% alpha acids)
4 AAU Hallertauer hops (15 min.) (1 oz./28 g at 4% alpha acids)
European ale yeast (Wyeast 1338 or White Labs WLP011)
1/4 cup brown sugar for priming
1/2 cup maple syrup for priming
1/8 cup corn sugar for priming

Step by Step
Heat 2.5 gal. (9.5 gal) water to 164 °F (73 °C). Crack and mix in pale, brown, crystal, chocolate, and smoked malts. Hold at 152 °F (67 °C) for 90 min. Wash the grains with 2.5 gal. (9.5 gal) water at 168 °F (76 °C).

Add to kettle the dry malt and the maple syrup. Total boil is 75 min. Bring to a boil, add the Styrian Goldings hops, boil 60 min. Add Hallertauer hops, boil 15 minutes. Remove from heat, pour into fermenter and top up to 5.25 gal. (20 L) with water. Cool to 68 °F (20 °C), pitch yeast.

Ferment at 65 °F (18 °C) for three weeks, then rack to your secondary. Age cool (50°F/10 °C) for four weeks. Prime with the brown sugar, maple syrup, and corn sugar. Bottle and age three to five weeks.

Notes:
Extract with grains version: Omit pale malt, but steep the brown, crystal, chocolate, and smoked malts in 2.5 gal. (9.5 gal) of water at 150 °F (66 °C). Increase dry malt to 5 lbs. (2.3 kg), proceed from boiling.

All-grain version: Omit the dried malt extract. Increase the pale malt to 9.5 lbs. (4.3 kg), mash together with the specialty grains as above in 4 gal. (15.1 L) water, sparge with 5 gal. (19 L) water. Add maple syrup as above, and proceed from boiling. Plan your boil to reduce volume to 5.25 gallons (20 L), or top up in the kettle as you go along.

About maple: If you have the good fortune to have access to fresh maple sap, substitute it for water (or even boil a few gallons halfway down to get some additional maple flavor). Please use only real maple syrup and not the commercially produced flavored corn syrup!

About smoked grains: If your local supplier does not stock, or can’t at least special-order smoked malts for you, try the mail-order catalogs and online suppliers. If all else fails, it is possible to smoke your own malt, but I don’t recommend it because it is complicated, especially for a small quantity like what you need for this recipe.

Priming sugar (if bottling)

Step by Step
My current base malt is Great Western Pale Ale malt, but other malts of a similar nature should work well. I like Weyermann smoked malt. We use Best Malz Munich. I prefer British crystal malts as they have a huge caramel flavor and the same goes for black and chocolate malt. Feel free to substitute any high quality malt of a similar flavor and color from a different supplier. My hops are in pellet form and come from Hop Union, Willamette Valley, or Hopsteiner depending on the variety.

Mill the grains and dough-in targeting a mash of around 1.5 quarts (1.4 L) of water to 1 pound (0.45 kg) of grain (a liquor-to-grist ratio of about 3:1 by weight) and a temperature of 154 °F (68 °C). Hold the mash at 154 °F (68 °C) until enzymatic conversion is complete. Infuse the mash with near-boiling water while stirring or, with a recirculating mash system, raise the temperature to mash out at 168 °F (76 °C). Sparge slowly with 170 °F (77 °C) water, collecting wort until the pre-boil kettle volume is around 6.5 gallons (25 L) and the gravity is 1.050.

The total wort boil time is 90 minutes. During boil, add hops and other additions at times indicated. Chill the wort to 67 °F (19 °C) and aerate thoroughly. The proper pitch rate is 2 packages of liquid yeast or 1 package of liquid yeast in a 2.5-liter starter.

Ferment at 67 °F (19 °C) until the yeast drops clear. At this temperature and with healthy yeast, fermentation should be complete in about one week. Allow the lees to settle and the brew to mature without pressure for another two days after fermentation appears finished. Rack to a keg and force carbonate or rack to a bottling bucket, add priming sugar, and bottle. Target a carbonation level of 2.5 volumes.

(5 gallons/19 L, extract with grains and partial mash)

IBU = 31  SRM = 39  ABV = 6.5%

Ingredients
4.9 lbs. (2.2 kg) pale liquid malt extract
2.6 lbs. (1.2 kg) beech smoked malt (8 °L)
14.1 oz. (0.4 kg) Munich malt (8 °L)
14.1 oz. (0.4 kg) crystal malt (40 °L)
14.1 oz. (0.4 kg) crystal malt (75 °L)

Priming sugar (if bottling)

Step by Step

For most extract beers I use an ultra-light extract made by Alexander’s (California Concentrate Company), but any fresh, high-quality light-color extract will work well. Always choose the freshest extract that fits the beer style. If you cannot get fresh liquid malt extract, it is better to use an appropriate amount of dry malt extract (DME) instead. I like Weyermann smoked malt and we use Best Malz Munich. Ideally, both of these should be converted in a partial mash. Weyermann smoked malt extract would be a good substitute for the smoked and Munich malts.

Mill or coarsely crack the specialty malt and place loosely in a grain bag. Avoid packing the grains too tightly in the bag, using more bags if needed. Steep the bag in about 1.5 gallons (~6 liters) of water at 165 °F (74 °C). The idea is that your temperature, once you add the grain, will drop back to an ideal temperature for the malt conversion and will convert some of the starch from the Munich and smoked malt. After 30 to 60 minutes, lift the grain bag out of the steeping liquid and rinse with warm water. Allow the bag to drip into the kettle for a few minutes while you add the malt extract. Do not squeeze the bag. Add enough water to the steeping liquor and malt extract to make a pre-boil volume of 5.9 gallons (22.3 L) and the gravity is 1.055. Stir thoroughly to help dissolve the extract and bring to a boil.

The total wort boil time is 60 minutes. Add the first hop addition once the wort starts boiling and the other hop and fining additions at the times indicated. Chill the wort to 67 °F (19 °C) and aerate thoroughly. The proper pitch rate is 2 packages of liquid yeast or 1 package of liquid yeast in a 2.5-liter starter.

Ferment at 67 °F (19 °C) until the yeast drops clear. At this temperature and with healthy yeast, fermentation should be complete in about one week. Allow the lees to settle and the brew to mature without pressure for another two days after fermentation appears finished. Rack to a keg and force carbonate or rack to a bottling bucket, add priming sugar, and bottle. Target a carbonation level of 2.5 volumes.

Smoked Pumpkin Seed Saison
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.071 FG = 1.020
IBU = 24 SRM = 15 ABV = 6.6%

Ingredients
11.5 lbs. (5.2 kg) 2-row pale malt
0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) wheat malt
0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) crystal malt
0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) biscuit malt
1.0 lb. (0.45 kg) brown sugar
3.0 lbs. (1.4 kg) smoked pumpkin and seeds
1.0 lb. (0.45 kg) rice hulls
3.5 AAU Styrian Goldings hops (60 min.) (0.7 oz./19 g of 5% alpha acids)
2.5 AAU Saaz hops (20 min.) (0.63 oz./18 g of 4% alpha acids)
4 cloves (10 min.)
5 cinnamon sticks (10 min.)
4 nutmeg (cracked) (10 min.)
1 tsp. Irish moss (15 min.)
White Labs WLP566 (Platinum Belgian Saison II) yeast
(3 qt./3 L yeast starter)

Step by Step
Smoke pumpkin chunks at 250–300 °F (121–149 °C) until soft (about 3 hours). As an option, you can roast the pumpkin seeds separately on a cookie sheet in a 325 °F (162 °C) oven until browned (about 15 minutes). Mash grains, smoked pumpkin chunks and seeds at 153 °F (67 °C) in 4.5 gallons (17 L) of water for 60 mins. Lauter slowly to prevent stuck mash. Boil wort for 60 minutes, adding hops and spices at times indicated. Ferment at 68 °F (20 °C). Rack to secondary at 14 days.

Partial mash option:
Decrease amount of 2-row pale malt to 2.5 lbs. (1.1 kg). Add 1.0 lb.
(0.45 kg) light dried malt extract and 5.0 lbs. (2.3 kg) light liquid malt extract. See all-grain recipe for how to process pumpkin and seeds. Add 6.7 qts. (6.2 L) of 164 °F (73 °C) water to a 5-gallon (19-L) beverage cooler (Gott or Rubbermaid, the kind they use on the sidelines of sporting events.) Place crushed grains and pumpkin solids in a (very) large nylon steeping bag. Submerge bag, stirring constantly, then add additional hot water, if needed, until grains and pumpkin pieces are just submerged. Mash at 153 °F (67 °C) for 60 minutes. Recirculate by drawing off about 2 cups and adding it to top of grain bed. Repeat until you’ve recirculated about 4 or 5 qts. (~4–5 L). Run off wort by collecting about 2 cups of wort, then adding that same volume of sparge water — at 170 °F (77 °C) — to the top of the grain bed. Collect about 2.75 gallons (10 L) of wort. Add dried malt extract and water to make 3.0 gallons (11 L). Boil wort for 60 minutes, adding hops and spices at times indicated. Add liquid malt extract in the final 15 minutes of the boil. Cool wort and top up to 5 gallons (19 L). Aerate and pitch yeast. Ferment at 68 °F (20 °C).

Smoked Wee Heavy
Smoked Wee Heavy
(5 gallons/19 L, partial mash)
OG = 1.070 FG = 1.022
IBU = 18 SRM = 15 ABV = 6.7%

Ingredients
2 lbs. (0.91 kg) pale malt
1 lb. (0.45 kg) medium crystal malt (50 °L)
0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) flaked oats
2 oz. (57 g) roasted barley
1 oz. (28 g) peat-smoked malt
7.5 lbs. (3.4 kg) amber liquid malt extract
0.25 lb. (113 g) light brown sugar
4 AAU Kent Goldings hops (60 min.) (1 oz./28 g at 4% alpha acids)
Scottish ale yeast (Wyeast 1728 or White Labs WLP028) slurry
1/2 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Heat 1.5 gal. (5.6 L) water to 160 °F (71 °C). Mix in pale and crystal malts and oats. Hold at 150 °F (66 °C) for 75 min. Sprinkle roasted barley and smoked malt on top of mash, then sparge with 2.5 gal. (9.5 L) of 168 °F (76 °C) water. Take the first 2 qt. (2 L) of run-off and boil in a wide, flat pan for 20 min. or until caramelized (nearly burnt is fine).

Add caramelized wort, malt extract, and brown sugar to the kettle and bring to a boil. Add Goldings hops and boil 60 min. Remove from heat, begin cooling. Top up in the fermenter with enough chilled, pre-boiled water to make 5.25 gal (20 L). When cooled to 65°F, pitch yeast slurry (aerate the wort well — cover the fermenter and shake for several minutes before pitching the yeast).

Ferment cool (58 to 60 °F/14 to 16 °C) for three weeks, then transfer to secondary and age cooler (48 to 50 °F/9 to 10 °C) for three to four weeks. Prime with sugar and bottle condition or keg and force carbonate. It's okay to age this one...the longer it’s in the bottle/keg, the better.

All-grain:
Omit the malt extract, increase the pale malt to 13 lbs. (5.9 kg) and the crystal to 1.25 lbs. (0.57 kg). Mash in 18.7 qts. (17.7 L) water, and sparge with 4 gal. (15.1 L). Maintain the same times and temperatures, but caramelize the first 1 gal. (4 L) of wort. The rest of the procedure remains the same.

Extract with grains:
Omit the pale malt, steep the oats, crystal, roasted barely, and smoked malt in 3 gal. (11 L) at 150°F for 30 min. Increase the brown sugar to 0.5 lb. (0.23 kg), dissolve it in 1.5 qt. (1.5 L) of water, and caramelize as indicated. Increase the malt extract to 8.5 lbs. (3.9 kg), then proceed as above.

(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.057 FG = 1.014
IBU = 30 SRM = 14 ABV = 5.5%

Ingredients
9.5 lbs. (4.3 kg) Weyermann rauchmalz
2.0 lbs. (0.91 kg) Weyermann Munich Type I malt (~6 °L)
0.5 lbs. (0.23 kg) Weyermann CaraMunich® III malt (~60 °L)
8 AAU Magnum hops (60 mins) (0.57 oz./16 g of 14% alpha acids)
Wyeast 2206 (Bavarian Lager) or White Labs WLP820 (Oktoberfest/Märzen) yeast (3 qts./3 L yeast starter)

Step by Step
Ferment yeast starter at room temperature, then transfer to lagering fridge at beginning of brewday. Treat brewing water with one Campden tablet the night before brewday. For wort production, use a single decoction mash.

In your kettle, mash in to 131 °F (55 °C) with 17 qts. (16 L) of water. Pull first decoction, roughly the thickest one-third of the mash, and place it in a large kitchen pot. Heat decoction to 158 °F (70 °C) and hold for 5 minutes, then bring decoction to a boil. Boil decoction for 20 minutes, stirring constantly. Return decoction to main mash and add heat, if needed, to bring temperature to 152 °F (67 °C).

Hold for 45 minutes. Heat mash to 168 °F (76 °C), then transfer to lauter tun. (Try to minimize any splashing when you transfer it from the kettle to lauter tun.) Let grain bed set up for 5 minutes before you begin recirculating and running off the wort.

Keep sparge water heated so that the top of grain bed remains at 165–168 °F (74–76 °C) while you collect your wort. Collect 6.5 gallons (25 L) and boil for 90 minutes, expecting to yield 5.0 gallons (19 L) of wort after boil. Cool wort to 54 °F (12 °C) and transfer to fermenter.

Aerate well, pitch chilled yeast from starter and let ferment at 54 °F (12 °C) until rate of fermentation slows greatly (usually after 10–14 days). Let temperature rise to 60 °F (16 °C) to finish off fermentation. Lager beer for 4–6 weeks, then keg.

Tips For Success:

As the name implies, this is a smooth version of a rye IPA. It has the characteristic "snap" from rye and rye malt, but this is not as pronounced as in some rye beers. If you’d prefer a more "in your face" version, try adding a pound (0.45 kg) of rye malt to your mash (or steep) and 0.5 oz. (14 g) of Columbus hops — or any other high-cohumulone hop with a solid "bite" — at 30 minutes left in the boil. This will make a more aggressive beer, with an original gravity just short of 1.070 and IBUs somewhere in the 70s (depending on the alpha acid percent of the additional hops used).

IBU = 61 SRM = 4 ABV = 6.1%

Frankenlager is Smuttynose’s interpretation of an IPA decoction-mashed and fermented like the classic lagers of Europe. It’s crisp and refined, but certainly not meek or mild.

Ingredients
12.5 lbs. (5.7 kg) US 2-row pale malt
50 AAU German Magnum pellet hops (60 min.) (1 oz./28 g at 14% alpha acids)
1.8 AAU Saphir pellet hops (20 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 3.5% alpha acids)
3.4 AAU Saphir pellet hops (10 min.) (0.75 oz./21 g at 3.5% alpha acids)
3.5 AAU Saphir pellet hops (0 min.) (1 oz./28 g at 3.5% alpha acids)
5 oz. (140 g) Saphir pellet hops (dry hop)
1⁄2 tsp. yeast nutrient (15 min.)
1⁄2 Whirfloc® tablet (15 min.)
White Labs WLP920 (Old Bavarian Lager) or White Labs WLP833 (German Bock Lager) yeast
2⁄3 cup (133 g) dextrose (if priming)

Step by Step
This is either single or double decoction mash, so build in some extra time in your brew day to account for the added steps. Mill the grains and mix with 4.7 gallons (17.8 L) of 158 °F (70 °C) strike water to reach a mash temperature of 147 °F (64 °C). Hold at this temperature for 40 minutes. Remove one gallon (3.8 L) of the grist and bring it to a boil (decoction) then add it back to the mash tun. This should step the mash up to 162 °F (72 °C) where you hold again for 20 minutes. Direct fire (or double decoct) up to 170 °F (77 °C) and hold for 10 minutes if you wish to perform a mash out. Vorlauf until your runnings are clear. Sparge the grains with approximately 3.5 gallons (13.25 L) of 170 °F (77 °C) water until 6.5 gallons (24.6 L) of 1.046 SG wort is collected in your boil kettle. Boil for 60 minutes adding hops, yeast nutrient, and kettle finings according to the ingredients list. After the boil, create a whirlpool by gently stirring with a mash paddle for 2 minutes and then let rest for an additional 13 minutes. Chill the wort to 50 °F (10 °C), aerate, and pitch yeast. It is recommended that you pitch 424 billion yeast cells, which can be obtained by using either 1 fresh vial after making a 2.3 L stir plate starter, 2 fresh vials after making a 4.35 L non-stir plate starter or 5 fresh vials without a starter.

Ferment at 50 °F (10 °C) until you reach terminal gravity. Add dry hops and dry hop at 50 °F (10 °C) for a week. Crash cool for two days and then package. Carbonate to between 2.4 and 2.5 volumes of CO2.

Extract option:
Substitute the 2-row pale malt in the all-grain recipe with 8.5 lbs. (3.9 kg) golden light liquid malt extract. Bring 6.5 gallons (24.6 L) of water up to a boil. Remove from heat and add your malt extract and stir until fully dissolved. Return to a boil for 60 minutes. Follow the remaining portion of the all-grain recipe.

Noonan," a black IPA, was created as part of Smuttynose’s "Short Batch" series, which are their limited edition, experimental beers. They felt a good way to honor Greg’s memory would be to create a beer very similar to his Black Watch beer. Greg’s contribution to brewers everywhere lives on.

Ingredients
8.5 lbs. (3.9 kg) 2-row pale malt
2 lbs. (0.68 kg) British pale ale malt
1 lb. (0.45 kg) Carafa® II malt (450 °L)

4 AAU Sterling hops (0 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 8% alpha acids)
1 oz. (28 g) Glacier hops (dry hop)
1 oz. (28 g) Nugget hops (dry hop)
1⁄2 tsp. Irish moss (30 min)
1⁄2 tsp. yeast nutrient (15 min.)
White Labs WLP001 (California Ale) or Wyeast 1056 (American Ale) yeast
3⁄4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
This is a single step infusion. Mix the milled grains with 4.25 gallons (16.1 L) of 174 °F (79 °C) water to stabilize at 154 °F (68 °C) for 60 minutes. Add 1 lb. (0.45 kg) of milled Carafa® II malt to the top of the mash. Sparge slowly with 175 °F (79 °C) water. Collect approximately 6.5 gallons (25 L) of wort runoff to boil for 90 minutes. Add the hops, yeast nutrients and Irish moss at the times indicated.

Cool the wort to 75 °F (24 °C). Pitch your yeast and aerate the wort heavily. Allow the beer to cool to 68 °F (20 °C). Hold at that temperature until fermentation is complete. Transfer to a carboy, avoiding any splashing to prevent aerating the beer and add the Nugget and Glacier dry hops for seven days. Allow the beer to condition for one week and then bottle or keg. Allow the beer to carbonate and age for two weeks.

"This beer was designed to have some nice sweetness created by a mix of caramel malts and we wanted a decent hop presence as well. Over the years we’ve reduced the amount of cloves we’ve added as that one spice always seems to be the one to throw things out of balance. If I was brewing this at home I’d go easy on the clove and add more in later batches if needed." ~ David Yarrington, Brewmaster

Ingredients
10.75 lbs. (4.9 kg) 2-row pale malt
0.9 lb. (0.41 kg) Hugh Bairds light Carastan malt (15 °L)
4 oz. (0.11 kg) crystal malt (60 °L)
4 oz. (0.11 kg) pumpkin puree
5.5 AAU Cascade hops (75 min.) (1 oz./28 g at 5.5% alpha acids)
4.1 AAU Cascade hops (10 min.) (0.75 oz./21 g at 5.5% alpha acids)
3.4 AAU Liberty hops (0 min.) (0.75 oz./21 g at 4.5% alpha acids)
0.14 oz. (4 g) ground cinnamon (0 min.)
0.14 oz. (4 g) ground nutmeg (0 min.)
1 pinch ground clove (0 min.)
Wyeast 1056 (American Ale) or White Labs WLP001 (California Ale) or Lallemand BRY-97 (American West Coast Beer) or Fermentis US-05 yeast
¾ cup (150 g) dextrose (if priming)

Step by Step
Heat 4 gallons (15 L) of strike water to achieve a stable mash temperature of 155 °F (68 °C). Add the crushed grains and the pumpkin puree in the mash and hold at 155 °F (68 °C) for 60 minutes. Sparge and collect 6.25 gallons (24 L) of wort in the kettle. Boil for 75 minutes, adding hops and spices at times indicated. Give the wort a stir for at least a minute and let the hot wort settle for 15 minutes total. Then chill the wort to 68 °F (20 °C) and pitch the yeast. Maintain this temperature during active fermentation. Keg or bottle as normal.

Extract with grains option:
Substitute the 2-row pale malt in the all-grain recipe with 5.75 lbs. (2.6 kg) extra light dried malt extract. Heat 1 gallon (3.8 L) of water to 170 °F (77 °C) and place the crushed grains and the pumpkin puree in a brewing bag. Steep the grains and puree for 20 minutes at 160 °F (71 °C), then rinse the bag with 1 gallon (3.8 L) of hot water. Top off the kettle to make 6.25 gallons (24 L) wort and boil for 75 minutes. Follow the remaining portion of the all-grain recipe.

Tips for Success:
In the all-grain recipe, you may need to use 0.5 lb. to 1 lb. (0.23 to 0.45 kg) of rice hulls per 5-gallons (19-L) to prevent a slow or stuck sparge. You can also add a beta glucan rest at 122 °F (50 °C) for 15 minutes at the beginning of the mash.

1 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step

Mill the grains and dough-in with the rice hulls targeting a mash of around 1.25 quarts of water to 1 pound of grain (2.6 L/kg) and a temperature of 142 °F (61 °C). Add amyloglucosidase enzyme to mash and hold the mash at 142 °F (61 °C) for about 60 minutes or until enzymatic conversion is complete. Sparge slowly with 160 °F (72 °C) water (this will allow the mash to remain around 145 °F/63 °C and let the AMG continue to work while lautering), collecting wort until the pre-boil kettle volume is 7 gallons (26.5 L). Once you reach a boil, mix in 0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) of DME. Total boil time is 60 minutes, adding hops, Whirlfloc, and yeast nutrients as indicated. At the end of the boil, turn off heat, add the hops and whirlpool for 20 minutes. Chill the wort to 65 °F (18 °C), aerate thoroughly, and pitch yeast. Yeast cells needed are about 185.1 billion. As the fermentation nears completion, add the dry hops. Bottle or keg and carbonate as usual.

Wyeast 2206 (Bavarian Lager) or White Labs 820 (Octoberfest/Märzen) or Saflager 34/70 yeast (4 qt./~4 L yeast starter)
¾ cups corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Mash the grains at 152 °F (67 °C), using 5.6 gallons (21 L) of mash liquor heated to 163 °F (73 °C). Mash in, mix for 20 minutes, then rest for 20 minutes. Vorlauf (recirculate) for 15 minutes. Collect 7 gallons (26 L) of wort and check specific gravity (SG). If SG is below 1.061, you can either add dried malt extract to make it 1.061 or collect more wort — up to 9 gallons (34 L) — and extend the boil time accordingly. Boil for 120 minutes, adding the hops at the times indicated in the ingredients list. After the boil, turn off the heat and chill the wort rapidly to 55 °F (13 °C), aerate well and pitch the yeast. Ferment at 55 °F (13 °C) for the first 24 hours, then drop the temperature to 50 °F (10 °C). When the gravity hits 1.030-1.035, let the temperature rise to wherever it can for diacetyl rest. When primary fermentation is complete, bottle or keg as normal.

Partial Mash Option: Omit the 2-row malt, scale both the Wyermann Vienna malt and Wyermann Munic Type I malts to 1 lb. 4.2 oz, (0.57 kg) each. Add 3.0 lbs. (1.4 kg) Coopers Light dried malt extract and 6 lbs. (2.7 kg) Coopers Light liquid malt extract (late addition). Heat 5.5 quarts (5.2 L) of water to 166 °F (74 °C) and pour into 2-gallon (7.6-L) beverage cooler. Place crushed grains in a nylon steeping bag and submerge. Stir grains well, tie off bag lightly and seal cooler. Let partial mash rest, starting at 155 °F (68 °C), for 45 minutes. (It will most likely drop to around 150 °F (66 °C) by the end of the mash. This is fine.) While partial mash is resting, heat 0.75 gallons (2.8 L) of water to a boil in your brew pot and 5 qts. (4.7 L) of water to 180 °F (82 °C) in a large kitchen pot. Run off first wort and add to boiling water in brew pot. Add the 5 qts. (4.7 L) of 180 °F (82 °C) water to the cooler, untie bag, stir grains and let sit for 5 minutes. Run off second wort and add to brewpot. Add dried malt extract and bring to a boil. Add first charge of hops and boil for 60 minutes, adding other hops at times indicated in the ingredient list. With 15 minutes left in the boil, stir in half of the liquid malt extract; add the remaining half at the end of the boil. (Keep the boil clock running when adding extract.) Let the wort sit for 15 minutes before cooling. Cool the wort and top up with enough cool water to make 5 gallons (19 L), aerate well and pitch yeast. Follow fermentation and lagering instructions in all-grain recipe.

2⁄3 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Two days prior to brewday, make an appropriately-sized yeast starter. If using dried yeast, use 2 packets for pitching. A decoction or step mash program would be a great addition to this recipe. I used a single infusion mash though as time was short on this brewday.

Mill the grains and mix with 4 gallons (15 L) of strike water at 163 °F (73 °C) to reach a mash temperature of 150 °F (66 °C). Hold this temperature for 60 minutes. Vorlauf until your runnings are clear. Sparge with enough water to obtain 6.75 gallons (25.5 L) of wort. During the sparge, add the first wort hops to the boil kettle. Bring to a boil and boil for 75 minutes. Add the Irish moss or other kettle fining with 10 minutes remaining in the boil. After the boil, turn off heat and add the flameout hops. Begin a whirlpool of the wort, then let settle for 15 minutes. Filter the beer through a hopback if you have one. If not, you can add the Perle hops as you begin the chilling process. Chill the wort to 52 °F (11 °C). The aim is to have 5.25 gallons (20 L) of wort in your fermenter. Aerate with pure oxygen or filtered air and pitch yeast.

Ferment at 54 °F (12 °C) for 7 days, then increase temperature to 62 °F (17 °C) for three additional days. When no sign of fermentation is noticeable, drop temperature to 45 °F (7 °C) over the course of 5 days. Hold 3 days. Rack onto the dry hops, then wait for three days. Package the beer into a keg or bottle. Carbonate to approximately 2.3 volumes.

9.2 AAU Chinook hop pellets (30 min.) (0.75 oz./21 g at 12.3% alpha acids)
3 vanilla beans split and deseeded (0 min.)
1 tsp. ground cardamom powder (0 min.)
1⁄2 tsp. yeast nutrient (15 min.)
1⁄2 tsp. Irish moss (15 min.)
White Labs WLP007 (Dry English Ale) or Wyeast 1028 (London Ale) yeast
2⁄3 cup (133 g) dextrose (if priming)

Step by Step
This is a single step infusion mash. Mix the crushed grains with 5.5 gallons (21 L) of 168 °F (76 °C) water to stabilize at 155 °F (68 °C) for 60 minutes. Sparge slowly with 175 °F (79 °C) water. Collect approximately 6.5 gallons (25 L) of wort runoff to boil for 60 minutes. During the boil you will want to make the caramelized sugar. Mix 12 oz. (0.34 kg) sugar in 3⁄4 cup water in a sauce pan over medium heat. Stir constantly until it turns to a thick liquid and becomes a medium amber color. Add to boiling wort immediately before it hardens. Make the other kettle additions as per the schedule. At the end of the boil let the wort rest 20 minutes and remove the vanilla beans. Cool the wort to 75 °F (24 °C). Pitch your yeast and aerate the wort heavily. Ferment at 68 °F (20 °C). After fermentation is complete, transfer to a carboy, and condition for one week before you bottle or keg.

Extract with grains option:
Reduce the 2-row pale malt in the all-grain recipe to 1.5 lbs. (0.68 kg) and add 9 lbs. (4.1 kg) light liquid malt extract. Steep the crushed grains in 2 gallons (7.6 L) of water at 155 °F (68 °C) for 30 minutes. Remove grains from the wort and rinse with 2 quarts (1.8 L) of hot water. Add the liquid malt extract and boil for 60 minutes. Follow the remaining portion of the all-grain recipe.

Warlock is a jet-black, high-ABV spice beer. The rich cocoa flavors are well-balanced by the residual cinnamon and ginger notes, with complementary flavors of vanilla, nutmeg and clove.

Ingredients
16. lbs. (7.5 kg) 2-row pale malt
1 lb. (0.45 kg) Munich malt
1 lb. (0.45 kg) flaked barley
0.75 lb. (0.34 kg) debittered black malt
0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) crystal malt (60 °L)
0.25 lb. (0.11 kg) chocolate malt
1 lb. (0.45 kg) pumpkin puree
12 AAU Chinook hops (60 min.) (1 oz./28 g at 12% alpha acids)
Cinnamon, vanilla, nutmeg, ginger, and clove extracts – to taste
Wyeast 1335 (British Ale II) or White Labs WLP022 (Essex Ale) yeast
2/3 cup (133 g) dextrose (if priming)

Step by Step
Mill the grains and add the pumpkin puree, then mix with 6.25 gallons (23.7 L) of 163 °F (73 °C) strike water to reach a mash temperature of 152 °F (67 °C). Hold this temperature for 60 minutes. Vorlauf until your runnings are clear, and lauter. Sparge the grains with 1.5 gallons (5.7 L) and top up as necessary to obtain 6 gallons (23 L) of wort. Boil for 60 minutes, adding hops according to the ingredient list and Irish moss if desired. After the boil, chill the wort to slightly below fermentation temperature, about 66 °F (19 °C). Aerate the wort with pure oxygen or filtered air and pitch yeast. Ferment at 67 °F (19 °C) until wort reaches 1.028 specific gravity, then free rise to 72 °F (22 °C) until the completion of primary fermentation. Once the beer completes fermentation, reduce temperature to 32 °F (0 °C) and hold for 10 days. Draw a sample, and add spice extracts to taste, starting with a ratio of approximately 3:1 for the cinnamon to other extracts. Once the exact ratio/intensity is determined, scale up and add to the fermenter. Then bottle or keg the beer and carbonate to approximately 2.25 volumes.

Extract with grains option:
Substitute the 2-row pale malt in the all-grain recipe with 11 lbs. (5 kg) pale liquid malt extract. Bring 5.2 gallons (19.7 L) of water to approximately 165 °F (74 °C) and hold there, steeping the specialty malts and pumpkin puree in grain bags for 15 minutes. Remove the grain bags, and let drain fully. Add liquid malt extract while stirring, and stir until completely dissolved. Bring the wort to a boil for 60 minutes. Follow the remaining portion of the all-grain recipe.

This full-bodied imperial stout features notes of burnt caramel, coffee, and smoke.

Ingredients
14 lbs. (6.4 kg) 2-row pale malt
2 lbs. (0.9 kg) Carahell® malt
1 lb. (0.45 kg) flaked oats
0.5 lbs (0.23 kg) Simpsons dark crystal malt (75 °L)
0.5 lbs (0.23 kg) Patagonia Perla Negra (340 °L)
0.5 lbs (0.23 kg) roasted barley
13.6 AAU Columbus hops (90 min.) (0.85 oz./24 g at 16% alpha acid)
0.5 oz. (14 g) Magnum hops (0 min.)
White Labs WLP001 (California Ale) or Wyeast 1056 (American Ale) or Safale US-05
2/3 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Mill the grains, then mix with 5.8 gallons (21.9 L) of 165 °F (74 °C) strike water to reach a mash temperature of 152 °F (67 °C). Hold this temperature for 60 minutes. Vorlauf until your runnings are clear, and begin to sparge. Sparge the grains with enough water to obtain 7 gallons (25.6 L) of wort. Boil for 90 minutes, adding hops according to the ingredient list and Irish moss if desired.

After the boil, chill the wort to slightly below fermentation temperature, about 65 °F (18 °C). Aerate the wort with pure oxygen or filtered air and pitch yeast.

Ferment at 66 °F (19 °C) for seven days, then free rise to 72 °F (22 °C) until the completion of primary fermentation. Once the beer completes fermentation, reduce temperature to 32 °F (0 °C), then bottle or keg the beer and carbonate to approximately 2.25 volumes.

Partial Mash Option:
Scale the 2-row pale malt down to 2 lbs. (0.91 kg) and add 8 lbs. (3.6 kg) pale liquid malt extract. Bring 8 quarts (7.6 L) of water to approximately 165 °F (74 °C). Place crushed 2-row malt, Carahell and flaked oats in a large grain bag. Submerge in water, stirring the grains to making sure there are no dry clumps. Steep grains for 45 minutes, trying to maintain the temperature at 152 °F (67 °C). Place the crushed crystal and dark roasted malts in a second grain bag, submerge in the mash. Wait an additional 15 minutes, then remove both bags and place in a colander over the kettle. Slowly wash the grains with 2 gallons (7.6 L) hot water. Add liquid extract while stirring, and stir until completely dissolved. Top up to 7 gallons (26.5 L) and boil for 90 minutes, adding hops according to the ingredient list and Irish moss if desired. Now follow the all-grain recipe.

Tips for Success:
Brewer Clay Jordan notes that this beer mashes at a slightly lower temperature to help ensure there aren’t a lot of long-chain sugars in the wort. To ensure proper conversion, it may be necessary to add a few more minutes to the mash (say, lengthening to 70 minutes), especially if your strike water comes in a little low and you start in the 148-150 °F range (65-66 °C).

Ingredients
10 lbs. (4.5 kg) North American 2-row Pilsner malt
2 lbs. (0.91 kg) North American 6-row pale malt
4 oz. (0.11 kg) caramel Munich malt (60 °L)
6.4 AAU Nugget hops (60 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 12.75% alpha acid)
1.2 AAU Willamette hops (10 min.) (0.25 oz./7 g at 4.75% alpha acid)
1 tsp. Irish moss (15 min.)
Wyeast 3787 (Trappist High Gravity) or White Labs WLP530 (Abbey Ale) yeast
Priming sugar (if bottling)

Step by Step
Use a step-infusion mash starting at 148 °F (64 °C) for 75 minutes, then raise to 162 °F (72 °C) for 15 minutes. Raise grain bed to 168 °F (76 °C) to begin the lauter process. Sparge with enough water to collect about 6.5 gallons (25 L) of wort in the kettle. Boil for 90 minutes, adding the hops and Irish moss at the times indicated. After flameout, chill the wort down to 65 °F (18 °C) and pitch the yeast. You can then place in a warm space to allow fermentation temperature to start to rise to 72 °F (22 °C). Hold at this temperature during active fermentation. When active fermentation begins to settle down (kräusen begins to fall), increase the fermentation to 78 °F (26 °C) to be sure the yeast fements to completion. After all signs of fermentation have dissipated and final gravity has been reached, place the wort in cool storage at 50 °F (10 °C) for approximately 2 weeks. Carbonate to 2.5 to 3.0 volumes.

Ingredients
7.5 lbs (3.40 kg) 2-row pale malt
2.5 lbs (1.13 kg) 2-row pale ale malt
1.5 lbs. (0.68 kg) honey malt
0.25 lb. (0.11 kg) flaked wheat
2 AAU Cascade hops (30 min.) (0.25 oz./7 g at 8% alpha acids)
10 AAU Cascade hops (15 min.) (1.25 oz./35 g at 8% alpha acids)
25 AAU Amarillo® hops (0 min.) (2.5 oz./70 g at 10% alpha acids)
6 AAU Cascade hops (0 min.) (0.75 oz./21 g at 8% alpha acids)
8 AAU Apollo hops (0 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 16% alpha acids)
Wyeast 1056 (American Ale) orWhite Labs WLP001 (California Ale) or Safale US-05 yeast
3⁄4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Mill the grains, then mix with 3.7 gallons (13.9 L) of 166 °F (74 °C) strike water to reach a mash temperature of 154 °F (68 °C). Hold this temperature for 60 minutes.
Vorlauf until your runnings are clear, then begin to sparge. Sparge the grains with 4.5 gallons (17 L) and top up as necessary to obtain 6.5 gallons (24.6 L) of wort. Boil for 60 minutes, adding hops at the times indicated in the ingredients list found above. Add a kettle fining such as Irish moss or Whirlfloc if you so desire.

After the boil and whirlpool, rapidly chill the wort to slightly below fermentation temperature, which is 70 °F (21 °C) for this beer. Pitch yeast. Maintain fermentation temperature of 70 °F (21 °C), for ten days or until the completion of primary fermentation, whichever is later. Then, reduce temperature to 32 °F (0 °C), and bottle or keg the beer and carbonate to approximately 2.5 volumes.

(5 gallons/19 L, extract with grains)
OG = 1.057 FG = 1.014
IBU = 24 SRM = 8 ABV = 5.7 %

Ingredients
5.75 lbs (2.61 kg) pale dried malt extract
1 lb. (0.45 kg) honey malt
0.25 lb. (0.11 kg) flaked wheat
2 AAU Cascade hops (30 min.) (0.25 oz./7 g at 8% alpha acids)

Wyeast 1056 (American Ale) orWhite Labs WLP001 (California Ale) or Safale US-05 yeast
3⁄4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Bring 5 gallons (19 L) of water to approximately 166 °F (74 °C) and hold there, steeping the specialty malts in grain bags for 15 minutes. Remove the grain bags, and let drain fully. Add dried malt extract while stirring, and stir until completely dissolved. Turn heat back on and bring wort to a boil. Total boil time is 60 minutes, adding hops at the indicated times. Add a kettle fining such as Irish moss or Whirlfloc if you so desire.

After the boil and whirlpool, rapidly chill the wort to slightly below fermentation temperature, which is 70 °F (21 °C) for this beer. Pitch yeast. Maintain fermentation temperature of 70 °F (21 °C), for ten days or until the completion of primary fermentation, whichever is later. Then, reduce temperature to 32 °F (0 °C), and bottle or keg the beer and carbonate to approximately 2.5 volumes.

Tips for Success:
Fresh hops, a solid yeast pitch preferably from a starter, and sulfate-forward brewing water are keys to nailing this beer. Using fresh hops will net you bright, fresh hop flavors especially with the substantial late hop addition. The honey malt will add quite a bit of sweetness and without healthy yeast you might end up with an under-attenuated beer. Aim for a 2-L starter (OG at about 1.035) to provide enough healthy cells for a strong fermentation. Finally, with such a low calculated IBU beer for the style, a sulfate:chloride ratio of 1.5:1 would enhance the hop bitterness in the beer.

Step by Step
Mash at 152 °F (67 °C). Vorlaf until your runnings are clear, sparge, and then boil the wort for 90 minutes, hops as directed in the ingredients list. After the boil, turn off the heat and chill the wort rapidly to just below fermentation temperature, about 68 °F (20 C). Aerate the wort well and pitch the yeast. Ferment at 70 °F (21 °C). When the beer has reached final gravity, transfer to a bottling bucket for priming and bottling, or transfer to a keg.

Partial Mash Option:
Scale the 2-row pale malt down to 1 lb. and add 2 lbs. 14 oz. (1.3 kg) light dried malt extract and 5 lbs. 2 oz. (2.3 kg) light liquid malt extract (late addition). Begin by heating 2 gallons (7.6 L) of water in your brew pot. While that heats, steep the specialty grains at around 152 °F (67 °C in 1 gallon (3.8 L) of water in a large kitchen pot. Put the crushed grains in a large steeping bag and submerge bag in the kitchen pot for 30–45 minutes. At the end of the steep, remove the bag from the steeping pot and let drip dry for a minute or so. Add the "grain tea" to your brew pot and add the dried malt extract and sugar. Boil for 60 minutes, adding the hops at the times indicated in the ingredients list. With 15 minutes left in the boil, stir in liquid malt extract. After the boil, cool the wort, top up with enough cool water to make 5 gallons (19 L), aerate, and pitch yeast. Follow the remainder of the all-grain recipe.

Spoetzl Brewery: Shiner Bock clone
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.043 FG 1.010
IBU = 17 SRM = 16 ABV = 4.3%

Ingredients
3 lbs. (1.36 kg) 6-row pale malt
3 lbs. (1.36 kg) Vienna malt (4 °L)
2.66 lbs. (1.21 kg) corn grits
0.66 lbs. (0.29 kg) crystal malt (60 °L)
3 oz. (86 g) roasted barley (500 °L)
4.62 AAU Brewer’s Gold hops (60 min.) (0.6 oz./16 g at 8% alpha acids)
1 tsp. Irish moss
1/2 tsp. yeast nutrient
White Labs WLP940 (Mexican Lager) or Wyeast 2247 (European Lager) yeast (4 qt./4L starter)
7/8 cup (175 g) dextrose (if priming)

Step by Step
In a large kitchen pot, mix corn grits and 5 oz. (141 g) of the 6-row malt with 3.3 qts. (3.1 L) of 159 °F (71 °C) water to make a cereal mash. Hold cereal mash at 148 °F (64 °C) for 15 minutes. While cereal mash is resting, pour the rest of the grains into your brew kettle and mash in to 140 °F (60 °C). Use about 1.66 gallons (6.3 L) of water for an initially thick mash. Heat the cereal mash to a boil, stirring constantly, and boil for 30 minutes. After boiling the cereal mash, add it to the main mash and adjust temperature with water to 152 °F (67 °C). This should bring your mash thickness into the normal range. Mash for 45 minutes, then heat mash to 165 °F (74 °C). Stir frequently, and expect the temperature to keep climbing a bit after you shut off the heat. (Any temperature under 170 °F/77 °C is fine). Recirculate until wort is clear, then collect about 5 gallons (19 L) of wort, sparging with water sufficiently hot to keep grain bed between 165–170 °F (74–77 °C). Add 1.5 gallons (6 L) of water and boil wort for 90 minutes, adding bittering hops for final 60 minutes. Add yeast nutrient and Irish moss with 15 minutes left in the boil. Cool wort quickly to 54–65 °F (12–18 °C), aerate well and pitch yeast sediment from yeast starter. Ferment at 54 °F (12 °C) for 10–12 days, then let temperature raise to 60 °F (16 °C) for a diacetyl rest. This should take about 2 days, but taste beer before cooling. Rack beer to secondary fermenter and cool beer to 32–40 °F (0–4 °C). Lager for 30–45 days.

Partial mash option: Substitute the 6-row pale malt, Vienna malt, and corn grits in the all-grain recipe with 2.8 lbs. (1.3 kg) Briess light liquid malt extract, 1.9 lbs. (0.86 kg) brewer’s corn syrup, 0.25 lb. (0.11 kg) 6-row pale malt, and 1 lb. (0.45 kg) Munich malt (10 °L). Heat 1.75 gallons (6.6 L) of water in your brewpot and 3 quarts (2.8 L) of steeping water in a separate 6–8 qt. (6–8 L) pot. Place crushed grains in a steeping bag. When steeping water reaches 169 °F (76 °C), turn off heat and begin steeping grains. The temperature of the "steep" should drop to around 158 °F (70 °C). When the temperature of the steeping water falls to 148 °F (64 °C), remove grain bag from steeping water. Do not rinse grains with water or squeeze bag. Add "grain tea" from the steeping pot to your brewpot and heat to a boil. Once boiling, shut off heat and stir in malt extract. Boil for 60 minutes, adding hops once initial foaming subsides. Add corn syrup for the last 15 minutes of boil, stirring well to avoid scorching. Cool and top off to 5 gallons (19 L). Follow the remaining portion of the all-grain recipe.

OG = 1.049 FG = 1.017
IBU = 25 SRM = 25 ABV = 4.1%

This recipe may be best described as a modern brown porter that reflects the character of English porters 200 years ago. The resulting beer is smooth with good palate fullness and just a hint of bitterness from the hops and black malt, all backed up by the characteristic nutty, caramel, even vanilla-like flavors from the brown malt.

Ingredients
8 lbs. (3.6 kg) Crisp Maris Otter pale malt
2 lbs. (0.91 kg) Crisp brown malt
0.3 lb. (0.14 kg) Crisp black malt
6.6 AAU East Kent Golding hops (60 min.) (1.3 oz./37 g at 5.1% alpha acids)
0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) rice hulls (optional)
SafAle S-04 or Wyeast 1099 (Whitbread Ale) yeast
2⁄3 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by step
Mash the grains (if using rice hulls add them to the tun first) at 152–153 °F (67 °C) with 3.5 gallons (13 L) of water. After 60 minutes, run off and sparge with water at 160–170 °F (71–77 °C) to collect 6 gallons (23 L) of wort. Boil for 60 minutes, adding the Golding hops at the start.

At the completion of the boil, cool to about 70 °F (21 °C) and pitch the yeast. Ferment for seven days at about 65 °F (18 °C), then rack to secondary for a further 14 days before racking to keg or bottling and carbonating as usual to at least 2.0 v/v. Give it another two weeks or so before drinking the beer.

Tips for success:
The reason for the long 14-day conditioning recommendation prior to packaging is to ensure complete fermentation as brown malt often results in slowing the fermentation down in the end and you need to be sure that you have really reached terminal gravity before the final racking. Give it the full two weeks to ensure fermentation completion.

STEP BY STEP
Mash the grains at 154°F (68°C) in 6 gallons (23 L) of water for 60 minutes. Mash out, vorlauf, and then sparge at 175°F (79°C) to collect approximately 6.3 gallons (23.8 L) of wort. Boil for 90 minutes, adding the hops, Irish moss, and yeast nutrient as instructed. After the boil is complete, cool the wort to 50°F (10°C) or just below and transfer it to your fermenter. Pitch the yeast and aerate the wort heavily. Allow the beer to ferment at 50°F (10°C) until final gravity is reached. Gently transfer to a carboy, avoiding any splashing to prevent aerating the beer. Chill to almost freezing temperature and allow the beer to condition for an additional week. Prime and bottle condition or keg and force carbonate to 2.1 volumes CO2. Allow the beer to age for 4 more weeks to fully develop the flavors.

PARTIAL MASH OPTION:
Substitute the Weyermann Pale Ale malt with 6.6 pounds (3 kg) Briess light unhopped liquid malt extract and 1 pound (0.45 kg) light dried malt extract. Also, bump up the Perle hop addition (60 mins.) to 1.25 ounces (35 g). Mash the milled grain in 2.5 gallons (9.5 L) of water at 154°F (68°C) for 30 minutes. Remove the grains from the wort and rinse with 4 quarts (3.8 L) of hot water. Boil for 30 minutes. Add the liquid malt extract, dried malt extract, and first hop addition, then boil for 60 more minutes. While boiling, add the Irish moss and yeast nutrient as indicated. Chill the wort, transfer to your fermenter, and top up with filtered water to 5 gallons (19 L). Follow the remaining portion of the all-grain recipe.

Squash Tripel
Squash Tripel
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.072 FG = 1.005
IBU = 23 SRM = 4 ABV = 8.8%

An unspiced squash tripel recipe courtesy of Will Meyers, Brewmaster at Cambridge Brewing Company in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

Ingredients
12 lbs. (5.4 kg) Pilsner malt
4 oz. (113 g) Vienna malt
4 oz. (113 g) aromatic malt
3.75 lbs. (1.7 kg) heirloom squash (butternut or kabocha, preferred)
1.25 lbs. (0.57 kg) clear candi sugar (15 min.)
8 AAU Saaz hops (60 min.) (2 oz./57 g at 4% alpha acids)
Wyeast 3787 (Trappist High Gravity), White Labs WLP530 (Abbey Ale), Imperial Yeast B48 (Triple Double), or Mangrove Jack’s M41 (Belgian Ale) yeast
1 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Prepare the squash by washing and splitting them, removing the seeds
and other guts, and cutting into chunks. Shred into a fine julienne with a food processor shredding plate, but go slowly.

This recipe uses reverse osmosis (RO) water. Adjust all brewing water to a pH of 5.5 using phosphoric acid. Add 0.5 tsp of calcium chloride and 0.5 tsp of calcium sulfate to the mash.

Mash in the malts and shredded squash at 147 °F (64 °C) for 60 minutes. Raise the temperature to 168 °F (76 °C) to mashout. Recirculate for
15 minutes. Sparge slowly and collect 6.5 gallons (24.5 L) of wort.

Boil the wort for 90 minutes, adding hops at the times indicated in the recipe. The sugar is added with 15 minutes left in the boil.

Chill the wort to 62 °F (17 °C), pitch the yeast, and ferment until complete. Keep the temperature cool (64 °F/18 °C) for the first two or three days, then allow it to warm to no more than 72 °F (22 °C). Give it at least 10 days in primary, then at least three weeks in secondary. If you want to try something different, soak an ounce (~30 g) of medium-toast French oak chips in a dry, aromatic white wine like Sauvignon Blanc for a day, then put the chips in the secondary.

Rack, prime and bottle condition, or keg and force carbonate to 4 volumes.

Squash Tripel
(5 gallons/19 L, extract only)
OG = 1.072 FG = 1.005
IBU = 23 SRM = 4 ABV = 8.8%

Ingredients
8.9 lbs. (4 kg) extra light or Pilsner liquid malt extract
3.75 lbs. (1.7 kg) heirloom squash (butternut or kabocha, preferred)
1.25 lbs. (0.57 kg) clear candi sugar (15 min.)
8 AAU Saaz hops (60 min.) (2 oz./57 g at 4% alpha acids)
Wyeast 3787 (Trappist High Gravity), White Labs WLP530 (Abbey Ale), Imperial Yeast B48 (Triple Double), or Mangrove Jack’s M41 (Belgian Ale) yeast
1 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Prepare the squash by washing and splitting them, removing the seeds and other guts, and cutting into chunks. Shred into a fine julienne with a food processor shredding plate, but go slowly.

Use 6 gallons (23 L) of water in the brew kettle; heat to 158 °F (70 °C).

Place the shredded squash in a mesh bag and steep in the hot water for 3 hours. Remove the mesh bag, then turn the heat off.

Add the liquid malt extract and stir thoroughly to dissolve the extract completely. You do not want to feel liquid extract at the bottom of the kettle when stirring with your spoon. Turn the heat back on and bring to a boil. Boil the wort for 60 minutes, adding the hops at the times indicated in the recipe. Add the sugar with 15 minutes left in the boil.

Chill the wort to 62 °F (17 °C), pitch the yeast, and ferment until complete. Keep the temperature cool (64 °F/18 °C) for the first two or three days, then allow it to warm to no more than 72 °F (22 °C). Give it at least 10 days in primary, then at least three weeks in secondary.

Rack, prime and bottle condition, or keg and force carbonate to 4 volumes.

Squatters Pub Brewery: Full Suspension Pale Ale
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.043  FG = 1.012
IBU = 39 SRM = 8 ABV = 4%

This rich, Northwest-style pale ale is all about balance and sessionability. Maybe that’s why it won gold at the Great American Beer Festival in 2001 and 2002.

Ingredients
8 lbs. (3.6 kg) 2-row pale malt
1 lb. (0.45 kg) caramel munich malt (45 °L)
10 AAU of Nugget hops (60 min.) (0.6 oz./17 g at 14% alpha acids)
10 AAU of Columbus hops (5 min.) (0.77 oz./22 g at 13% alpha acids)
10 AAU of Columbus hops (0 min.) (0.77 oz./22 g at 13% alpha acids)
1 oz. (28 g) Columbus hops (dry hop)
1 tsp. Irish moss (15 min.)
White Labs WLP001 (California Ale) or Wyeast 1056 (American Ale) or Safale US-05 yeast (1.5 qt./~1.5 L yeast starter)
¾ cup (150 g) dextrose (if priming)

Step by Step
Use 12.5 qts. (11.8 L) of mash water and mash grains at 152 °F (67 °C) for 60 minutes. Mash out, vorlauf, and then sparge with 170 °F (77 °C) water to collect 5 gallons (19 L) of wort. Add 1.5 gallons (5.7 L) of water and boil wort for 90 minutes, adding hops at times indicated in ingredient list. After the boil is complete, turn off heat, give wort a stir for one minute, and then cover and leave alone for 15 minutes to whirlpool. Cool, aerate, and pitch yeast. Ferment at 68 °F (20 °C). After fermentation is complete, bottle or keg as usual.

Extract with grains option: Substitute the pale malt in the all-grain recipe with 6.6 lbs. (3 kg) Coopers light liquid malt extract. Steep crushed malts in 1.5 qts. (1.5 L) of water at 150 °F (66 °C) for 30 minutes. Rinse grains with 0.75 qts. (750 mL) of water at 170 °F (77 °C). Add water to make 3 gallons (11 L), stir in dried malt extract and bring to a boil. Add hops as indicated and liquid malt extract with 15 minutes remaining. Top off to 5 gallons (19 L) after cooling. Follow the remaining portion of the all-grain recipe.

Star Gazer Hazy Double IPA
Star Gazer Hazy Double IPA
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.064 FG = 1.012
IBU = 35 SRM = 4 ABV = 7%

This hazy double IPA was formulated to showcase the minty and green apple aroma notes from German Polaris hops and the tropical and juicy aromas from BSG Hops’ Zamba™ blend. The grist bill is typical for the style with a little boost from sucrose to increase wort gravity without adding non-fermentables or additional malt flavor. The hopping schedule and yeast strain are intended to set the stage for aroma retention and biotransformation while keeping hop bitterness in check.

Ingredients
6.5 lbs. (2.95 kg) Rahr North Star Pils Malt or other North American 2-row Pilsner malt
3.25 lbs. (1.47 kg) red wheat malt
1.5 lbs. (680 g) flaked oats
6 oz. (170 g) acidulated malt
1 lb. (454 g) sucrose (add with first wort hops)
8 AAU Polaris hops (first wort hop) (0.4 oz./11.5 g at 20% alpha acids)
2 AAU Polaris hops (60 min.) (0.1 oz./2.8 g at 20% alpha acids)
5 AAU Zamba™ hops (60 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 10% alpha acids)
20 AAU Polaris hops (hop stand) (1 oz./28 g at 20% alpha acids)
10 AAU Zamba™ hops (hop stand) (1 oz./28 g at 10% alpha acids)
1.5 oz. (42 g) Polaris hops (dry hop at day 2)
1.5 oz. (42 g) Zamba™ hops (dry hop at day 2)
1.5 oz. (42 g) Polaris hops (dry hop at day 4)
1.5 oz. (42 g) Zamba™ hops (dry hop at day 4)
SafAle K-97 (German Ale), Omega OYL-044 (Kolsch II), or LalBrew Köln yeast
1 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
This recipe uses reverse osmosis (RO) water. Add 2 tsp. calcium chloride, 1⁄2 tsp. calcium sulfate (gypsum), and 1⁄4 tsp. sodium chloride (non-iodized) to the mash water before mashing-in. Note that acidulated malt is included in the grist bill; mash pH following mashing-in should be about 5.4.

Mash the malts at 154 °F (68 °C) for 60 minutes. Start recirculating wort. Sparge slowly and collect 6.5 gallons (24.5 L) of wort. Add first wort hops and sugar while sparging the mash.

Heat to boiling, and boil the wort for 70 minutes, adding hops at the times indicated in the recipe. Adjust original gravity post-boil with RO water as required.

Chill the wort to 158 °F (70 °C), add the hop stand additions and give the wort a long stir to create a whirlpool, then let steep for 10 minutes. Continue cooling wort to ~68 °F (20 °C). Pitch yeast, and ferment between 60–68 °F (15.5–20 °C) until complete.

Dry hops should be added on day 2 and day 4 of fermentation. If using hop bags for dry hopping, remove bags on day 7; if not, rack into secondary fermenter or keg equipped with spunding valve. Complete fermentation and any hop creep following dry hopping should be finished by about day 21.

Prime and bottle condition, or serve from keg if naturally conditioned during aging.

Avery Brewing Co.’s 20th Anniversary Mephistopheles’ Stout clone
Avery Brewing Co.’s 20th Anniversary Mephistopheles’ Stout clone
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.102 FG = 1.020
IBU = 45 SRM = 70+ ABV = 11%

A "devil" of a beer, this iteration of Mephistopheles’ was made specifically for the 20th anniversary 2020 Big Beers, Belgians, and Barleywines festival. This decadent imperial stout was aged in a 20th Anniversary Leopold Brothers’ whiskey barrel. While the actual beer rang in at 17% and required some tools most homebrewers don’t have access to, this is a scaled down, homebrewer-friendly version provided by Avery Barrel Herder, Andy Parker.

Ingredients
11 lbs. (5 kg) American 2-row pale malt
1.63 lbs. (0.74 kg) Special B malt
1.44 lbs. (0.65 kg) roasted barley
1.06 lbs. (0.49 kg) black malt
0.88 lb. (0.39 kg) aromatic malt
2.25 lbs. (1.02 kg) golden dried malt extract (DME)
2 lbs. (0.91 kg) dextrose corn sugar
12.2 AAU Sterling hops (60 min.) (2 oz./56 g at 6.1% alpha acids)
1 oz. (28 g) Apollo hops (0 min.)
1 package oak cubes
~1 oz. (28 g) maple chips, charred
~1 cup Bourbon
Wyeast 3787 (Trappist Style High Gravity), or White Labs WLP530 (Abbey Ale), or LalBrew Abbaye Belgian Ale yeast
3⁄4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by step
The maple chips may be found in the grilling section of your hardware store. A propane torch can be used to scorch the exterior. You are just looking to caramelize the sap in the maple, not to turn them into charcoal. Soak the oak cubes and charred maple chips in Bourbon — just enough to cover. They should be soaked a minimum of two weeks, more if possible. If you can get your hands on a small used Bourbon barrel, then skip the oak cubes but still soak the maple chips.

On brew day, add 1 tsp. of CaCl2 and 1⁄8 tsp. of CaSO4 (gypsum) along with 1⁄4 tsp. of 10% phosphoric acid. Employing a thick mash (1.5 qts./lb. or 2.5 L/kg), achieve a mash temperature of 153 °F (67 °C) and hold for 60 minutes or until fully converted. After mash is complete, raise temperature to 168–170 °F (76–77 °C) for mashout and a 10-minute recirculation. Begin collecting your wort and sparge with 170 °F (76 °C) water with a pH at or near 5.2. Sparge with enough water to collect roughly 6.5 gallons (24.6 L) of wort.

Boil for 60 minutes, adding the first hop addition, dextrose, and DME at the start of the boil. With 30 minutes remaining, add another teaspoon of CaCl2. The first and most important reason to add this is to make sure there is enough calcium in the wort for yeast health, knowing that you will lose some of your original addition in the mash. Secondly, the CaCl2 addition will round out the flavors and bring out the grain/malt character desired in the beer. With 10 minutes remaining, add a 1⁄2 tsp. of yeast nutrient. One Whirlfloc tablet can also be added at this time to help with beer clarity, although the beer will be opaque black. At knockout, add the Apollo hops.

After conducting a 10-minute whirlpool, chill rapidly to 66 °F (19 °C). Oxygenate thoroughly and pitch yeast. When gravity reaches 1.060 (after about four days of primary fermentation) increase temperature to 70 °F (21 °C) for warm conditioning for at least six additional days. If terminal gravity hasn’t yet been reached, letting it go a few more days is fine. Rack the beer into a secondary fermenter on top of the wood and Bourbon, or if you have a Bourbon barrel, then rack beer onto the maple and Bourbon in the barrel. Once flavor profile is achieved with a distinct wood and Bourbon character it’s time to package. Carbonate to 2.5 v/v or prime and bottle condition.

St. Bernardus Brewery, Belgium
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.094 FG = 1.017
IBU = 16 SRM = 37 ABV = 11%

This recipe is for their 60th anniversary edition, which is closer to their original recipe. Although probably not authentic, the debittered black malt will give you a much smoother product. It’s reported that St. Bernardus uses a different bottling strain than the fermentation strain, so we recommend using Westmalle’s yeast.

Ingredients
10.5 lbs. (4.8 kg) pale ale malt
3 lbs. (1.4 kg) Munich malt (10 °L)
1 lb. (0.45 kg) aromatic malt
0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) Carafa® Special III malt
2 lbs. (0.91 kg) Belgian candi syrup (Dark 2) (15 min.)
1 lb. (0.45 kg) cane sugar (15 min.)
3.5 AAU Wye Challenger hops (60 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 7% alpha acids)
1.3 AAU Styrian Golding (20 min.) (0.25 oz./7 g at 5% alpha acids)
Wyeast 3787 (Trappist High Gravity) or White Labs WLP530 (Abbey Ale) yeast
1 cup (200 g) dextrose (if bottling)

Step by Step
Mash with a 15-minute rest at 135 °F (57 °C), a 35-minute rest at 145 °F (63 °C), a 25-minute rest at 165 °F (74 °C) and for 5 minutes at 172 °F (78 °C). Collect 6 gallons (23 L) and boil wort for 60 minutes, adding hops and sugars at times indicated in the ingredient list. Cool wort and aerate. Pitch yeast at 70 °F (21 °C). Let fermentation temperature rise to around 83 °F (28 °C). Rack beer to secondary and condition for six to eight weeks at 50 °F (10 °C). Carbonate to 3.0–3.5 volumes of CO2.

Partial mash option: Substitute the Pilsner malt in the all-grain recipe with 8 lbs. (3.6 kg) Pilsner liquid malt extract and reduce the Munich malt to 2.5 lbs. (1.1 kg). Partial mash the crushed grains at 152 °F (67 °C) for 45 minutes in 5.5 qts. (5.2 L) of water. Boil wort for 60 minutes, adding hops and sugars at times indicated. Stir in liquid malt extract with 15 minutes left in boil. After cooling, top off to 5 gallons (19 L). Follow the remaining portion of the all-grain recipe.

This Gueuze is a typical, traditional Belgian-style recipe. Brew frequently throughout the year cellaring your Gueuze for months to years. After a year, if you have at least 3 batches of different ages, you can begin experimenting with blending. Your best option is to test your patience and begin blending after 3 years with a minimum of 3 batches.

Ingredients
6.2 lbs. (2.8 kg) Dingemans pale ale malt
2.2 lbs. (1 kg) Dingemans pale wheat malt
0.5 lb. (227 g) Dingemans Cara 45 malt
2.4 AAU Fuggle hops (30 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 4.8% alpha acid)
Wyeast 3278 (Belgian Lambic Blend) or White Labs WLP655 (Belgian Sour Mix I) or East Coast Yeast ECY01 (Bug Farm) blend
3/4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Mill the grains and dough-in targeting a mash of around 1.2 quarts of water to 1 pound of grain (2.5 L/kg) and a temperature of 152 °F (67 °C) using 2.7 gallons (10.1 L) of water at 166 °F (74 °C). Hold the mash at 152 °F (67 °C) until enzymatic conversion is complete, about 60 minutes. In your hot liquor tank, bring 4.4 gallons (16.7 L) of water up to 170 °F (77 °C). Sparge slowly with 170 °F water (77 °C), collecting wort until the pre-boil kettle volume is 5.75 gallons (21.8 L). Add hops once a boil is reached. Total boil time is only 30 minutes. Chill the wort to 68 °F (20 °C) and aerate thoroughly. Pitch 1 package of yeast, do not make a starter prior to pitching as a starter can alter the blend’s fermentation characteristics. Ferment in primary at 68 – 70 °F (20-21°C) for two weeks. Move to a secondary fermentor, which will act as your aging and conditioning fermentor. This can be plastic, glass, stainless or a wood barrel. Age three months to three years and blend with other batches of Gueuze.

(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.079 FG = 1.013
IBU = 32.5 SRM = 5.7 ABV = 8.7%

This is a good example of a modern homage to the heritage mild. Nick Smith at Steam Machine told me he was inspired by reading Ron Pattinson’s blogs and seeing heritage mild recipes that were completely unlike anything he’d seen before. The brewery had been gifted some honey from a local producer and wanted to use it in the mild in place of invert sugar, and the honey flavors blend perfectly with the sweet and floral aroma of East Kent Golding hops.

Ingredients
6.7 lbs. (3 kg) Crisp Chevallier® Heritage malt
6.7 lbs. (3 kg) mild malt
2 lbs. (0.9 kg) honey (0 min.)
6.25 AAU East Kent Golding hops (60 min.) (1.25 oz. at 5% alpha acids)
4.5 AAU East Kent Golding hops (10 min.) (0.9 oz. at 5% alpha acids)
White Labs WLP013 (London Ale), or Wyeast 1028 (London Ale), or SafAle S-04 yeast
1⁄3 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by step
Mash crushed grains at 149 °F (65 °C) for 60 minutes. Batch sparge for 15 minutes at 162 °F (72 °C). Collect 6.5 gallons (24.5 L) of wort in the brew kettle. Place jars of honey in a bowl of warm water (85–90 °F/29–32 °C) at this time to help loosen up the honey and make it easier to add later. Bring wort to boil for a standard 60-minute boil, adding hops as indicated in the ingredients list.

When the boil is complete, stir in the honey until dissolved. Cool wort down to 65 °F (18 °C) and transfer to fermentation vessel. Add yeast as packet directs.

Bottle conditioning mild is much more traditional than force carbonating in a keg, but either way mild is best served at lower carbonation levels. Aim for 1.5–2.0 volumes of carbonation.

When the boil is complete, stir in the honey until dissolved. Cool wort down to 65 °F (18 °C) and transfer to fermentation vessel. Add yeast as packet directs.

Bottle conditioning English mild is much more traditional than force carbonating in a keg, but either way mild is best served at lower carbonation levels. Aim for 1.5–2.0 volumes of carbonation.

IBU = 20 SRM = 5 ABV = 4.7%

Steve Bader is the owner of Bader Beer and Wine Supply in Vancouver, Washington and is BYO's ex-Replicator. Steve says, "This beer is a favorite hot weather beer due to its lighter body and refreshing taste from the coriander and bitter orange peel. Hop bittering levels are subdued to let the coriander and bitter orange peel come through in the bitterness."

"The wit is slightly cloudy, with a very light color since there are no grains with any color used to make this beer. The wit yeasts help to give the refreshing flavor with a bit of "spicy" phenolic and tart flavors. The wit yeasts also can handle slightly warmer fermentation temperatures to 74 °F (23 °C), making this a good beer to brew in the late spring or early summer."

Ingredients
6.6 lbs. (3.0 kg) Coopers Wheat liquid malt extract (unhopped)
0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) Belgian wheat malt
0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) Belgian Pilsner malt
5.4 AAU Hallertau hops (60 min)(1.5 oz./42 g of 3.6% alpha acids)
0.5 oz. (14 g) coriander seed (crushed)
1 oz. (28 g) bitter orange peel
White Labs WLP400 (Belgian Wit Ale) or Wyeast 3944 (Witbier) yeast
0.75 cup corn sugar (for priming)

Step by Step
Steep the crushed malts in 3 gallons (13.5 L) of water at 152 ºF (67 °C) for 30 minutes. Remove grains from wort, add the malt syrup and bring to a boil. Add the bittering hops and boil for 60 minutes. Add the spices for the last 15 minutes of the boil. Cool the wort to 75 °F (24 °C), transfer to fermenter, top off to 5 gallons (19 L) aerate the beer and pitch your yeast. Ferment at 70–
74 °F (21–23 °C) until fermention ends, then bottle and enjoy!

All-grain option:
Replace the 6.6 lbs. (3.0 kg) of malt syrup and both grains with 5.5 lbs. (2.5 kg) of Pilsner malt, and 5.5 lbs. (2.5 kg) of wheat malt. Mash at 152 ºF (67 °C) for 60 minutes. Collect approximately 7.0 gallons (32 L) wort to boil for 90 minutes and have a 5 gallon (19 L) yield. Lower the amount of the hops to 1.25 oz. (35 g) ounce to account for higher hop utilization.

Steve Piatz's Sterling Pilsner (Bohemian Pilsner)
Steve Piatz's Sterling Pilsner (Bohemian Pilsner)
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.056 FG = 1.014
IBU = 45 SRM = 3 ABV = 5.4%

Recipe autor Steve Piatz says, "Sterling Pilsner is a Bohemian Pilsner and is unique only in the use of all Sterling hops rather than the traditional Saaz hops. The first batch was the result of winning a sample of really fresh Sterling hops from HopUnion in a contest back when Sterling wasn't widely available. According to HopUnion Sterling was released in 1998 and is perceived as similar to a Saaz and Mt. Hood combination and is finding favor as a Saaz replacement. Since my water supply is extremely high in carbonates and Pilsen's water is very low in mineral content, I blended 0.5 gallons (~2 L) of my water with enough reverse osmosis water to make the batch."

Ingredients
11.25 lbs. (5.1 kg) 2-row Pilsner malt (US)
10.5 AAU Sterling hops (90 min.) (1.75 oz./49.7 g of 6% alpha acids)
1.2 AAU Sterling hops (15 min.) (0.2 oz./5.7 g of 6% alpha acids)
0.3 AAU Sterling hops (10 min.) (0.05 oz./1.4 g of 6% alpha acids)
0.3 AAU Sterling hops (5 min.) (0.05 oz./1.4 g of 6% alpha acids)
0.3 AAU Sterling hops (0 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g of 6% alpha acids)
White Labs WLP800 (Pilsner Lager) or White Labs WLP802 (Czech Budejovice) yeast
0.75 cups corn sugar (for priming)

Step by Step
Mashed with 3.75 gallons (14 L) of water at 152 °F (67 °C) for 30 minutes (until converted). Sparge the mash with 168 °F (76 °C) water until you collect 6.4 gallons (24 L) of wort in the kettle. The 90 minute boil will reduce the wort to 5.7 gallons (22 L) before chilling and will yield the target 5.5 gallons (21 L) of wort after chilling. Add a tablet of Whirlfloc for the last 20 minutes of the boil. Alternatively, you can use Irish moss for the last 20 minutes. At the end of the boil, the wort is chilled to the fermentation temperature — 52 °F (11 °C) — and the yeast is pitched from a large starter. Ferment at 52 °F (11 °C). Once the fermentation is nearly complete, do a diacetyl rest by letting the beer warm up to around 60 °F (16 °C) and leave it at that temperature for a day or so to allow the yeast to metabolize the diacetyl and then start a slow (4 °F/2 °C drop per day) chill down to a lagering temperature of 30–32 °F (-1.1–0 °C). Even a couple of weeks of lagering will help mellow the flavors; but 6 to 14 weeks is even better. Tradition calls for lagering a light colored beer like a Pilsner from 3 to 7 days per 4 specific gravity points of the original gravity or, for a 1.056 OG, from 42 to 98 days.

At the end of the lagering, the beer should be clear and is ready to drink once carbonated. If you keg your beer just adjust the pressure to hit around 2.3 volumes of CO2. If you want to bottle condition your beer, you should consider adding a fresh lager yeast along with the priming sugar since there won't be much viable yeast left after the long lagering stage. An alternative approach for bottle conditioning is to bottle the beer after the diacetyl rest and then keep the beer at primary fermentation temperature (52°F) for a couple of weeks to allow the beer to carbonate, then you can lager the carbonated beer in the bottles.

Extract Option:
If you can perform a full-wort boil, use 6.25 lbs. (2.8 kg) of very light colored dry malt extract in place of the Pilsner malt. Stovetop brewers could boil 3 lbs. 2 oz. (1.4 kg) of Muntons Light dried malt extract in 2.5 gallons (9.5 L) of water then add 4.25 lbs. (1.9 kg) of Alexander's Pale liquid malt extract for the final 15 minutes of the boil.

(4 gallons/15 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.090 (21.6 °P) FG = 1.021 (5.3 °P)
IBU = 27 SRM = 15 ABV = 9.2% (10.6% ABV after concentration)

Ingredients
10.4 lbs. (4.7 kg) Best Malz Pilsen (or similar continental Pilsner) malt 2 °L
7.3 lbs. (3.3 kg) Munich malt (8 °L)
0.9 lb. (400 g) Weyermann CaraMunich® III malt (57 °L)
4.8 AAU Magnum hops (60 min.) (0.4 oz./12 g at 13.5 alpha acids)
1.6 AAU Hallertau hops (30 min.) (0.4 oz./12 g 4.0% alpha acids)
White Labs WLP830 (German Lager) or Wyeast 2206 (Bavarian Lager)

Step by Step
Mill the grains and dough-in targeting a mash of around 1.5 quarts (1.4 L) of water to one pound (0.45 kg) of grain (a liquor-to-grist ratio of about 3:1 by weight) and a temperature of 155 °F (68 °C). Hold the mash at 155 °F (68 °C) until enzymatic conversion is complete. Infuse the mash with near-boiling water while stirring or with a recirculating mash system raise the temperature to mash out at 168 °F (76 °C). Sparge slowly with 170 °F (77 °C) water, collecting wort until the pre-boil kettle volume is around 6.5 gallons (25 L) and the gravity is 1.070 (17 °P).

The total wort boil time is 90 minutes, which helps reduce the S-Methyl methionine (SMM) present in the lightly kilned Pilsner malt and results in less Dimethyl Sulfide (DMS) in the finished beer. Add the first hop addition with 60 minutes remaining in the boil. Add the second hop addition 30 minutes later. Add Irish moss or other kettle finings with 15 minutes left in the boil. Chill the wort to 50 °F (10 °C) and aerate thoroughly. The proper pitch rate is around 600 billion cells, which is six packages of liquid yeast or two packages of liquid yeast in a 10-liter starter. You should consider making a smaller beer first and repitching the yeast from that beer into this one instead of making such a large starter.

Ferment around 50 °F (10 °C) until the yeast drops clear. With healthy yeast, fermentation should be complete in two weeks or less, but do not rush it. Cold fermented lagers take longer to ferment than ales or lagers fermented at warmer temperatures. If desired, perform a diacetyl rest during the last few days of active fermentation.

Once the beer has finished fermentation, let it lager for one month at near-freezing temperatures. Transfer the beer to a Cornelius keg or similar container that can be flushed with CO2 and can withstand the freezing process without cracking. Freeze concentrate the beer by 20%. Transfer the still liquid portion to another container, leaving behind the ice portion. It will be best to force carbonate this beer versus trying to bottle condition it. Target a carbonation level of two volumes. A month or more of cold conditioning at near freezing temperatures will improve the beer. Serve at 43 to 46 °F (6 to 8 °C).

White Labs WLP830 (German Lager) or Wyeast 2206 (Bavarian Lager)

Step by Step
I have used a number of Munich blend extracts and most will do an admirable job of brewing eisbock. Always choose the freshest extract that fits the beer style instead of focusing on the brand name. If you cannot get fresh liquid malt extract, use an appropriate amount of dried malt extract instead.

Place the milled CaraMunich® loosely in a grain bag. Steep the bag in about 1 gallon (~4 liters) of water at roughly 170 °F (77 °C) for about 30 minutes. Lift the grain bag out of the steeping liquid and rinse with warm water. Allow the bags to drip into the kettle. Do not squeeze the bags. Add the malt extract and enough water to make a pre-boil volume of 5.9 gallons (22.3 liters) and a gravity of 1.076 (18.4 °P). Stir thoroughly to help dissolve the extract and bring to a boil.

Once the wort is boiling, add hops at times indicated. Add Irish moss or other kettle finings with 15 minutes left in the boil. Chill the wort to 50 °F (10 °C) and aerate thoroughly. The proper pitch rate is around 600 billion cells, which is six packages of liquid yeast or two packages of liquid yeast in a 10-liter starter. You should consider making a smaller beer first and repitching the yeast from that beer into this one instead of making such a large starter.

Still of the Night Mead
Still of the Night Mead
(3 gallons/11.4 L)
OG = 1.058 FG = 1.006
ABV = 6.6%

Ingredients
5 lbs. (2.3 kg) honey (clover or wildflower)
1/2 tsp. acid blend
1/2 tsp. gypsum
1/2 tsp. Fermax or other yeast nutrient
Yeast of your choice or Lalvin D-47

Step by Step
Bring water to a boil, add water treatments (usually gypsum and acid blend). Remove from heat and stir in the honey and yeast nutrients. Let sit for 15 minutes covered, the chill to 75 °F (23 °C) and move to fermenter. Pitch yeast. Seal and put the mead in a relatively cool 65 to 70 °F (18-21 °C) corner. Ferment 10 to 14 days in primary, then rack to a glass secondary. Age in secondary for at least six weeks (check the airlocks regularly to avoid evaporation and contamination problems). Bottle (when gravity has fallen below 1.020), either as is or priming with one-eighth cup of corn sugar per gallon for sparkling mead. Since you will be aging for considerably longer than most beers, oxygen-absorbing caps or wine corks are strongly recommend. Leave the bottled mead undisturbed in a cool, dark place for three months before you even think about trying one. The first one will probably disappoint you. Leave it another three months and try it again. Like bottle-conditioned beer, bottled sparkling mead will cast a considerable amount of sediment, so decant carefully when serving.

(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.076  FG = 1.019
IBU = 63 SRM = 51 ABV = 7.3%

Ingredients
13 lb. 10 oz. (6.2 kg) Pilsner malt
12 oz. (0.34 kg) chocolate malt
8.0 oz. (0.23 kg) Caramunich® malt
8.0 oz. (0.23 kg) crystal malt (90 °L)

6.5 AAU Hallertau hops (30 min.) (1.0 oz./28 g of 6.5% alpha acids)
0.5 oz. (15 g) Hallertau hops (15 min.)
Wyeast 2206 (Bavarian Lager yeast) or White Labs WLP820 (Octoberfest/Märzen Lager) yeast
1 cup corn sugar (for priming)

Step by Step
Mash at 154 °F (68 °C). Boil wort for 60 minutes. Ferment at ale temperatures, then rack to barrel and age six months to a year (or more). Pull samples from all of your barrels every few months and taste them.

Extract with grains option:
Omit Pilsner malt and add 3.25 lb. (1.5 kg) Briess Light dried malt extract and 5.75 lb. (2.6 kg) Weyermann Pilsner liquid malt extract. Steep grains in 3 qts. (~3 L) of water at 154 °F (68 °C) for 45 minutes.

Rinse with 1.5 qts. (~1.5 L) of water at 170 °F (77 °C). Add water to make 3 gallons (11 L), add dried malt extract and bring to a boil. Boil for 60 minutes, stirring in liquid malt extract for final 15 minutes of boil.

Poor Man's Barrel Option:
Don’t have the budget (or room) for a barrel? Try this "poor man’s" method of emulating some of the aspects of barrel aging. Conduct your primary fermentation in a bucket or ferment the beer with ale yeast, then rack it to a bucket — adding any "bugs" that may be called for. Buckets are more permeable to oxygen than barrels are, so let the beer
condition in the bucket for only about 3 months, then rack it to a carboy for the remaining conditioning time. Two weeks before racking, take 3.0 oz. (85 g) of oak cubes (French oak, medium toast) and soak them in wine. Use Chardonnay for the Temptation clone, Pinot Noir for La Roja, Cabernet Sauvignon for Darth Porter and Burgundy or Meritage for
Grand Cru and La Folie. Change wine every 3 days to lessen the intensity of the new oak. Add cubes when beer is racked to carboy.

(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.068 FG = 1.012
IBU = 74 SRM = 15 ABV = 7.3%

Ingredients
15 lbs. (6.8 kg) BestMalz Red X® malt
8.3 AAU Magnum hops (first wort hop) (0.65 oz./18 g at 12.7% alpha acids)
15.4 AAU Mosaic® hops (15 min.) (1.28 oz./36 g at 12% alpha acids)

1.28 oz. (36 g) Amarillo® hops (dry hop)
1.28 oz. (36 g) Cascade hops (dry hop)
White Labs WLP007 (Dry English Ale), Wyeast 1098 (British Ale), or LalBrew Nottingham yeast
¾ cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Using 0.9 qts. of water per pound of grain (2 L/kg), mash in at 148 °F (64 °C), rest for 60 minutes or until conversion has been achieved. Increase temperature to 165 °F (74 °C) for 5 minutes to halt the conversion process. Considering the thick mash, you can achieve this by infusing boiling water.

Recirculate your wort for 10–15 minutes or until clear. Begin your lautering process as you sparge to collect 6.5 gallons (24.5 L) while adding your first wort hop addition. Boil for 60 minutes and add the suggested hops during the last 15 minutes and at the end of the boil. Yeast nutrients and a kettle fining such as Irish moss or Whirlfloc can be added too. After the boil, give the wort a long stir to create a whirlpool, then let settle for 15 minutes.

Chill wort rapidly to 68 °F (20 °C), pitch your yeast and oxygenate. Ferment at 72 °F (22 °C) until final gravity is reached and clear of diacetyl (10 to 14 days is standard). Remove from yeast and add your dry hop additions to the fermenter. Let sit for 3 days. Chill the beer then rack into kegs and carbonate to 2.4 to 2.5 volumes or a touch higher if you intend to hand bottle from the keg. Otherwise, prime and bottle condition.

While it may be hard to mimic the color and character of Pataskala Red X without a majority BestMalz Red X® base malt, we can try to mimic the color and toasted character with some playful substitutions. If you can utilize a partial mash in your setup, then go with as much Red X® as you can while proportionally cutting back on the Munich extract and Carafa® malt.

Ingredients
3 lbs. (1.36 kg) extra light dried malt extract
3.5 lbs. (1.6 kg) Munich dried malt extract
3 oz. (85 g) Carafa® Special III malt
8.3 AAU Magnum hops (first wort hop) (0.65 oz./18 g at 12.7% alpha acids)
15.4 AAU Mosaic® hops (15 min.) (1.28 oz./36 g at 12% alpha acids)

1.28 oz. (36 g) Cascade hops (dry hop)
White Labs WLP007 (Dry English Ale), Wyeast 1098 (British Ale), or LalBrew Nottingham yeast
¾ cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Heat 2 gallons (7.6 L) of water, adding the Carafa® Special malt in a muslin bag and submerge while the water heats up. Once the temperature reaches about 165 °F (74 °C) remove the grains, giving a gentle squeeze to the bag.

Increase temperature to near-boiling before turning off heat and adding the malt extract plus another gallon (3.8 L) of water. Stir continuously until all extract is dissolved. Put the pot back on heat, add the first wort hops, then raise to a boil. Boil for 60 minutes and add the suggested hops during the last 15 minutes and at the end of the boil. After the boil, give the wort a long stir to create a whirlpool, then let settle for 15 minutes.

Chill wort rapidly to 68 °F (20 °C). Add water to achieve a total fermenter volume of 5.5 gallons (20.82 L). Follow the all-grain recipe for fermentation and packaging instructions.

Tips For Success:
Since Red X® is such a unique malt and doesn’t have a true extract equivalent, brewing this beer all-grain is the ideal way to go. However, for those who haven’t gone to all-grain brewing or don’t have the space to do so, the extract recipe will give you a pretty great IPA that will be similar in color, even if it may lack some of the brightness and malt character of the all-grain version. Whatever you do, seek out this specific grain and do not substitute for something "similar" because nothing on the market will get you close enough to the character that Red X® provides . . . at least at this time.

Heat from the rocks boils the wort and caramelizes sugars they directly contact. To brew this beer, you will need at least a 10 gallon pot, a stainless steel basket and heat resistant tongs to handle the rocks. For safety purposes, it would be best to get a friend to help you. When moving the rock-filled basket into the wort, suspend it by the basket handle from the middle of a pole, held on each end by one brewer. So here’s the recipe — do you have the stones to try it?

Ingredients
5.0 lbs. (2.3 kg) 2-row pale malt
5.5 lbs. (2.5 kg) Munich malt
0.5 lbs. (0.23 kg) crystal malt (40 °L)
6 AAU Hallertau hops (60 min.) (1.5 oz./43 g of 4% alpha acids)
10-15 fist-sized chunks of granite
1 tsp. Irish moss
White Labs WLP002 (English Ale) yeast (1 qt/1 L starter)
0.75 cups corn sugar (for priming)

Step by Step
Start a hardwood fire in a large grill. Let fire burn down to coals and place rocks in coals. Mash grains in 2.5 gallons (9.5 L) of water. Hold mash temperature at 150 °F (66 °C) for 60 minutes. Run off wort, then sparge with 170 °F (77 °C) water to yield 6 gallons (23 L) of wort. With heat-resistant tongs, remove 3 to 5 rocks from coals and place in a stainless steel basket. Whisk away any ash or embers from rocks with barbecue brush. Submerge basket with stones in wort. Boil for 90 minutes. Rotate rocks in kettle with those on the coals during entire boil period to maintain boil. Add hops with 60 minutes left in boil, Irish moss with 15 minutes left in boil. Cool wort, siphon to fermenter, aerate and pitch yeast. Place stones on a clean surface and allow them to cool. Store stones — wrapped in plastic wrap or in clean Tupperware-type containers — in refrigerator. After one week of primary fermentation, add rocks to sanitized bucket and rack beer on top of stones (which will be surrounded in a layer of caramelized sugar). Let condition for 2 weeks. Bottle or keg.

Extract with grains option:
Replace 2-row and Munich malt with 3.5 lbs. (1.6 kg) Weyermann Bavarian Pils liquid malt extract and 4.0 lbs. (1.8 kg) Weyermann Munich amber liquid malt extract. Heat 6 gallons (23 L) of water to 160 °F (71 °C) and stir in malt extracts until they are completely dissolved. Place crushed crystal malt in a steeping bag and steep in wort for 45 minutes. Keep temperature between 148–162 °F (64–72 °C) while steeping. Remove bag and begin heating with heating with rocks as described in the all-grain instructions.

Strike Brewing Co.’s Beat the Heat clone
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.049 FG = 1.008
IBU = 24 SRM = 3 ABV = 5.4 %

Ingredients
10 lbs. (4.54 kg) Weyermann Barke Pilsner malt
6.5 AAU Magnum hops (60 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 13% alpha acids)
2 oz. (57 g) Taiheke® hops (dry hop)
GigaYeast GY045 (German Lager), White Labs WLP830 (German Lager), Wyeast 2124 (Bohemian Lager), or SafLager W-34/70 yeast
7⁄8 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Mill the grains, then mix with 3.75 gallons (14.2 L) of 162 °F (72 °C) strike water to reach a single infusion temperature of 150 °F (66 °C). Hold the mash at this temperature for 60 minutes.

You can begin the lauter process by either raising to mashout temperature or simply vorlauf the mash until the runnings are clear. Sparge the grains with 4.5 gallons (17 L) and top up as necessary to obtain 6.5 gallons (25 L) of wort. Add the Magnum hops at the outset of the boil and then continue to boil for 60 minutes.

After the boil, rapidly chill the wort down to 68 °F (20 °C). Pitch the yeast and aerate if using a liquid strain. After 24 hours, drop the temperature of the fermentation to 58 °F (14 °C) and then after a second 24 hours, drop it further to 53 °F (12 °C). Maintain this cold fermentation temperature until the gravity reads approximately 1.012–1.015. Raise the temperature back to 58 °F (14 °C) and then allow it to free-rise to clean up any diacetyl.

Once the final gravity has been reached, dry hop with the Taiheke® hops for three days. Rack off the yeast and hops or dump the yeast, dry hops, and trub, and lager the beer for 2–3 weeks at near-freezing temperature (32–34 °F/1–2 °C). Bottle or keg the beer and carbonate to approximately 2.8 volumes.

Strike Brewing Co.’s Beat the Heat clone
(5 gallons/19 L, extract only)
OG = 1.050 FG = 1.009
IBU = 24 SRM = 4 ABV = 5.4 %

Ingredients
5.5 lbs. (2.49 kg) Pilsen dried malt extract
6.5 AAU Magnum hops (60 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 13% alpha acids)
2 oz. (57 g) Taiheke® hops (dry hop)
GigaYeast GY045 (German Lager), White Labs WLP830 (German Lager), Wyeast 2124 (Bohemian Lager), or SafLager W-34/70 yeast
7⁄8 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Bring 5 gallons (19 L) of water to a boil. At some point prior to boiling, off heat, add the dried malt extract while stirring, and stir until completely dissolved. Add the Magnum hops at the outset of the boil. Boil for 60 minutes.

After the boil, rapidly chill the wort to 68 °F (20 °C). Pitch yeast. After 24 hours, drop the temperature of the fermentation to 58 °F (14 °C) and then after a second 24 hours, drop it further to 53 °F (12 °C). Maintain this coldest fermentation temperature until the gravity reads 1.012–1.015. Raise the temperature back to 58 °F (14 °C) and then allow it to free-rise to clean up any diacetyl.

Once the final gravity has been reached, dry hop with the Taiheke® hops for three days. Rack off the yeast and hops or dump the yeast, dry hops, and trub, and lager the beer for 2–3 weeks at near-freezing temperature (32–34 °F/1–2 °C). Bottle or keg the beer and carbonate to approximately 2.8 volumes.

Tips for Success:
According to Ryan Bridge, Head Brewer at Strike, "The unique thing about this lager is that we do a ‘warm-start’ ferment. It allows us to pitch less yeast and gives the yeast a strong start at warmer temperatures before we slowly ramp down. The resulting beer has some mild, fruity yeast esters that really work well with the dry hop. We also don’t fine or filter, so it retains a slight haze." Additionally, "This beer has noticeable hop flavor and aroma (tropical fruit/grapefruit/lime) over a crisp, bready body with mild, fruity yeast esters. It is seriously drinkable and a perfect outdoor summer beer."

IBU = 21 SRM = 6+ (sugar dependent) ABV = 7.4%

Sugar selection can completely change the impression of a Belgian beer. Some dubbels are little more than Belgian blondes with dark candi syrup instead of pure sucrose.

Ingredients
7.5 lbs. (3.4 kg) European Pilsner malt
2.75 lbs. (1.25 kg) Belgian pale malt
0.25 lbs. (0.11 kg) melanoidin malt
6 AAU Hallertau whole hops (60 min.) (1.5 oz./43 g of 4% alpha acid)
White Labs WLP530 (Abbey Ale), Wyeast 3787 (Trappist High Gravity), or Fermentis Safbrew T-58
Priming sugar (if bottling)

Step by Step
Heat 15 qts. (14 L) of water to achieve a mash temperature of 153 °F (67 °C). Mash at 153 °F (67 °C) for 60 minutes. Sparge slowly with 170 °F (77 °C) water, collecting wort until the pre-boil kettle volume is around 6.5 gallons (24.6 L).

Boil the wort for 75 minutes adding the hops with 60 minutes left in the boil. Chill the wort to 65 °F (18 °C), let the break material settle, rack to the fermenter, aerate the wort with filtered air or pure O2 and pitch yeast.

Ferment at 72 °F (22 °C). After fermentation is complete, transfer the beer into five jugs with 4 oz. per gallon (120 g per 4 L) of agave, gur, date sugar, candi sugar/syrup, homemade caramel, golden syrup, or unrefined cane sugars (e.g., turbinado, demerara, muscovado). Once the final gravity is stable, bottle or keg each aiming for 2.2 volumes of CO2. Use the priming chart at https://byo.com/resources/carbonation to determine the priming sugar needs.

2.75 lbs. (1.25 kg) Belgian pale malt
0.25 lbs. (0.11 kg) melanoidin malt
6 AAU Hallertau whole hops (60 min.) (1.5 oz./43 g of 4% alpha acid)
White Labs WLP530 (Abbey Ale), Wyeast 3787 (Trappist High Gravity), or Fermentis Safbrew T-58
Priming sugar (if bottling)

Step by Step
Heat 6 qts. (5.7 L) of water to achieve a mash temperature of 153 °F (67 °C). Mash the grains at 153 °F (67 °C) for 60 minutes. Raise the temperature to mash out at 168 °F (76 °C) and begin the lauter phase. Bring the wort to a boil and add the dried malt extract off heat. Stir until the extract is dissolved and return to a boil.

Boil the wort for 75 minutes adding the hops with 60 minutes left in the boil. Chill the wort to 65 °F (18 °C), let the break material settle, rack to the fermenter, aerate the wort with filtered air or pure O2 and pitch yeast.

Ferment at 72 °F (22 °C). After you are certain that fermentation is complete, transfer the beer into five 1-gallon (3.8-L) jugs with 4 oz. per gallon (120 g per 4 L) each of agave, gur, date sugar, candi sugar/syrup, homemade caramel, golden syrup, or unrefined cane sugars (e.g., turbinado, demerara, muscovado).

Once the final gravity is stable, bottle or keg the beer, each aiming for 2.2 volumes of CO2. Use the priming chart at https://byo.com/resources/carbonation to determine your priming sugar needs.

(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.073 FG = 1.011
IBU = 29 SRM = 12 ABV = 8.5%

Ingredients
6 lbs. (2.7 kg) Munich malt (9 °L)
6 lbs. (2.7 kg) German Pilsner malt
1.2 lbs. (0.54 kg) Caravienne® malt (20 °L)
1.2 lbs. (0.54 kg) cane (beet) sugar

IBU = 29 SRM = 12 ABV = 8.5%

Ingredients
4 lbs. (1.8 kg) Pilsner liquid malt extract
4 lbs. (1.8 kg) Munich liquid malt extract
1.2 lbs. (0.54 kg) Caravienne® malt (20 °L)
1.2 lbs. (0.54 kg) cane (beet) sugar
1 oz. (28 g) black patent malt (500 °L)
9 AAU Fuggles hops (60 min.) (2 oz./57 g at 4.5% alpha acids)
Wyeast 2565 (Kölsch) yeast
3⁄4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
If you can source Weyermann Munich liquid malt extract, then split the total extract 50/50 as per the ingredients list. If Briess is the only available liquid malt extract, then use the Briess Munich liquid malt extract as 100% of the total extract.

Bring 5.6 gallons (21.2 L) of water to approximately 162 °F (72 °C) and hold there steeping the milled specialty grains in grain bags for 15 minutes. Remove the grain bags, and let drain fully. Add liquid extract while stirring, and stir until completely dissolved. Before boiling, add and stir-in cane sugar until dissolved. Boil for 60 minutes, adding hops according to the ingredient list. After the boil, chill the wort to near fermentation temperature, about 65 °F (18 °C). Aerate the wort with pure oxygen or filtered air and pitch the yeast. Follow the remainder of the all-grain recipe.

Tips for Success:
The right fermentation temperature and the right yeast strain are essential here. A warm fermentation runs the risk of making a "hot" beer, which this is most definitely not, despite the relatively high ABV! Cooler-fermenting but well-attenuating strains (I recommend the Kolsch, but several Scottish strains or the German Ale strain work well, too) will allow a complete fermentation with minimal hot alcohols and put an upper-limit on the esters produced, letting the malts really shine through. Wyeast 3725 (Bière de Garde) and White Labs WLP072 (French Ale) are limited edition releases that are also fitting. The other key component to this beer is age: its name literally means "beer that has been stored (lagered)." Brew it, and then forget it for a while. I’ve opened (and entered in competition) bottles of this beer that are more than a year old.

Step by Step
Add calcium chloride (CaCl2) to the brewing water for a minimum 100 ppm of calcium (Ca2+). Mash the grains at 144 °F (62 °C) and hold at this temperature for 30 minutes. Raise grain bed to 151 °F (66 °C) and hold at this temperature for 30 minutes. Raise grain bed to mash out at 172 °F (78 °C) then begin the sparge. Sparge until you collect 6 gallons (23 L) in your kettle or until pre-boil gravity in the kettle reaches about 1.063 specific gravity. Total boil time is 60 minutes, adding hops at the times indicated and Whirlfloc® tablet with 10 minutes left in the boil. At 0 minutes, add the last addition of hops then give the wort a stir for at least a minute and let settle for 20 minutes. If your wort pH needs adjusting, add lactic acid to be sure your wort is at 5.2 at this point. Chill the wort to 68 °F (20 °C), let the cold break settle, pitch the yeast and aerate. Ferment at 70 °F (21 °C) for five days or until signs of fermentation have subsided. Add dry hops and let the beer sit on the dry hops for five days. Drop the temperature to 54 °F (12 °C) and condition the beer for three weeks at this temperature. Rack to a keg and force carbonate or rack to a bottling bucket, add priming sugar, and bottle. Target carbonation levels around 2.4 volumes CO2.

Partial mash:
Reduce the Irish stout malt in the all-grain recipe to 1 lb. (0.45 kg) and add 7 lbs. (3.2 kg) extra light dried malt extract (2 °L).

Sun King Brewing Company: Tequila Barrel-Aged Fistful of Hops clone
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.058 FG = 1.010
IBU = 78 SRM = 13  ABV = 6.4%

"Fistful of Hops is a quarterly rotating seasonal IPA, which means every three months the hops change. We usually combine two to three varieties of hops together for each new release. The same varieties and proportion of hops are used all the way through the recipe including dry hopping." – Dave Colt, Sun King Brewery

Ingredients
11 lbs. (57 kg) 2-row pale malt
10 oz. (283 g) flaked rye
8 oz. (227 g) Weyermann Caraaroma® malt (130 °L)
12.5 AAU Warrior® hops (70 min.) (0.75 oz./21 g at 16.6% alpha acids)
2.4 AAU Mosaic™ hops (20 min.) (0.2 oz./6 g at 12% alpha acids)
2.6 AAU Nelson Sauvin hops (20 min.) (0.2 oz./6 g at 13% alpha acids)
1.9 AAU Amarillo® hops (20 min.) (0.2 oz./6 g at 9.4% alpha acids)
4.2 AAU Mosaic™ hops (5 min.) (0.35 oz./10 g at 12% alpha acids)
4.5 AAU Nelson Sauvin hops (5 min.) (0.35 oz./10 g at 13% alpha acids)
3.3 AAU Amarillo® hops (5 min.) (0.35 oz./10 g at 9.4% alpha acids)
6 AAU Mosaic™ hops (0 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 12% alpha acids)
6.5 AAU Nelson Sauvin hops (0 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 13% alpha acids)
4.7 AAU Amarillo® hops (0 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 9.4% alpha acids)
0.5 oz. (14 g) Mosaic™ hops (dry hop)
0.5 oz. (14 g) Nelson Sauvin hops (dry hop)
0.5 oz. (14 g) Amarillo® hops (dry hop)
Tequila-soaked oak chips (light toast)
White Labs WLP001 (California Ale) or Wyeast 1056 (American Ale) or Safale US-05 yeast
3/4 cup (150 g) dextrose (if priming)

Step by Step
Mill the grains and target a mash temperature of 150 °F (66 °C). Hold at this temperature for 60 minutes. Sparge to collect about 6.5 gallons (25 L). Boil for 90 minutes, adding the hops at the times indicated. After the boil is complete, turn off the heat and stir in the flameout hop addition and begin a vigorous whirlpool in your kettle. Let settle for 15 minutes. Chill the wort, aerate thoroughly, and then pitch the yeast. Ferment at 68 °F (20 °C) until primary fermentation is complete. Add dry hops for 4-7 days.

To approximate tequila barrel aging at home, Colt suggests, "get the lightest toasted oak chips you can find and soak them in the tequila of your choice. Now add them to the beer. Taste the beer weekly and pull it off of the chips when it has reached the state where you can taste the wood, the spirit, and beer in harmony. Better still, get a 5-L oak barrel and fill it with tequila and let it age a few weeks to a month at a minimum. Next enjoy the tequila you aged and fill it back up with beer. Make sure to purge out any oxygen from the barrel before filling it with beer." After aging, bottle or keg as normal.

Partial mash option:
Reduce the 2-row pale malt in the all-grain recipe to 1 lb. (0.45 kg) and add 6.6 lbs. (3 kg) light liquid malt extract. Place crushed grains in a large muslin bag. Heat 1 gallon (3.8 L) of water and target a mash temperature of 150 °F (66 °C). Add the grain bag and hold the mash at 150 °F (66 °C) until enzymatic conversion is complete, about 60 minutes. Remove the grain bag and slowly wash the grains with 1 gallon (3.8 L) of hot water. Add the liquid malt extract and top off to 6.5 gallons (25 L) in the brewpot. Total boil time is 90 minutes. Follow the remaining portion of the all-grain recipe.

Surly Brewing Company Furious IPA clone
(5 gallons/ 19 L, extract with grains)
OG = 1.060  FG = 1.014
IBUs = 99 SRM = 15 ABV = 6%

Ingredients:
6.6 lbs. (3 kg ) Muntons light, unhopped liquid malt extract
1.5 lbs. (0.68 g) Hugh Baird or Simpson Golden Promise malt
10 oz. (0.28 kg) Belgian aromatic malt (25 °L)
12 oz. (0.34 kg) crystal malt (60 °L)
2 oz. (57 g) roast barley (480 °L)
3 AAU Ahtanum hop pellets (first wort hop) (0.5 oz./14 g of 6% alpha acid)
20 AAU Warrior hop pellets (60 min.) (1.25 oz./35 g of 16% alpha acid)
4.8 AAU Warrior hop pellets (2 min.) (0.3 oz./8.5 g of 16% alpha acid)
1.5 AAU Ahtanum hop pellets (2 min.) (0.25 oz./7 g of 6% alpha acid)
2.5 AAU Amarillo hop pellets (2 min.) (0.25 oz./7 g of 10% alpha acid)
3.2 AAU Simcoe hop pellets (2 min.) (0.25 oz./7 g of 12.8% alpha acid)
0.25 oz. (7 g) Ahtanum whole leaf hops (dry hop)
0.25 oz. (7 g) Amarillo whole leaf hops (dry hop)
0.25 oz. (7 g) Simcoe whole leaf hops (dry hop)
0.1 oz. (2.8 g) Warrior whole leaf hops (dry hop)
1⁄2 tsp. yeast nutrient (last 15 min.)
1⁄2 tsp. Irish moss (last 30 min. of the boil)
White Labs WLP 007 (Dry English Ale) or Wyeast 1335 (British Ale II) yeast
0.75 cup (150 g) of corn sugar for priming (if bottling)

Step by step
Steep the crushed grain in 2 gallons (7.6 L) of water at 153 ºF (67 ºC) for 30 minutes. Remove grains from the wort and rinse with 2 quarts (1.8 L) of hot water. Add the liquid malt extract plus the first wort hop addition and boil for 60 minutes. While boiling, add the hops, Irish moss and yeast nutrient as per the schedule. Now add the wort to 2 gallons (7.6 L) of cold water in the sanitized fermenter and top off with cold water up to 5 gallons (19 L).

Cool the wort to 75 ºF (24 ºC). Pitch your yeast and aerate the wort heavily. Allow the beer to cool to 68 ºF (20 ºC). Hold at that temperature until fermentation is complete. Transfer to a carboy, avoiding any splashing to prevent aerating the beer and add the dry hops. Allow the beer condition for one week and then bottle or keg. Allow the beer to carbonate and age for about two weeks and enjoy your Furious IPA.

All grain option:
This is a single step infusion mash. Use 8.0 lbs. (3.63 kg) 2-row pale malt to replace the liquid malt extract and increase the Golden Promise malt to 3.0 lbs. (1.36 kg). Mix the crushed grains with 3.75 gallons (14 L) of 170 °F (0 °C) water to stabilize at 153 ºF (67 ºC) for 60 minutes. Sparge slowly with 175 ºF (79 ºC) water.

Collect approximately 6 gallons (23 L) of wort runoff to boil for 60 minutes. Reduce the 60-minute hop addition to 1 oz. (28 g) Warrior hop pellets (16 AAU) to allow for the higher utilization factor of a full wort boil. The remainder of this recipe and procedures are the same as the extract with grain recipe.

Note: If you have difficulty locating Golden Promise malt, substitute Maris Otter.

Surly Brewing Co.'s Bender clone
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.057 FG = 1.013
IBU = 43 SRM = 27 ABV = 6%

Bender is a category-bending American brown ale brewed with oat crystal malt. It is described by the brewery as "crisp and lightly hoppy, complemented by the velvety sleekness oats deliver. Belgian and British malts usher in cascades of cocoa, bitter coffee, caramel, and hints of vanilla and cream."

INGREDIENTS
7.5 lb. (3.4 kg) British 2-row pale malt
2 lb. (0.9 kg) Belgian aromatic malt
0.75 lb. (0.34 kg) British medium crystal malt (55°L)
0.75 lb. (0.34 kg) Belgian Special B malt (135°L)
0.63 lb. (0.28 kg) Simpsons Golden Naked Oats (10°L)
4 oz. (113 g) British chocolate malt (425°L)
1.25 AAU Willamette hops (first wort hop) (0.25 oz./7 g at 5% alpha acids)
10.5 AAU Columbus hops (60 mins.) (0.75 oz./21 g at 13% alpha acids)
2.5 oz. (71 g) Willamette hops (0 mins.)
Wyeast 1335 (British Ale II) or White Labs WLP022 (Essex Ale) yeast
3/4 cup (150 g) dextrose (if priming)

STEP BY STEP
Mash the grains at 152°F (67°C) and hold for 60 minutes. Vorlauf until your runnings are clear and add the Willamette first wort hops to the kettle. Sparge the grains with 4 gallons (15 L) of water and top up as necessary to obtain 6 gallons (23 L) of wort. Boil the wort for 60 minutes, adding the Columbus hops at the beginning of the boil and the second Willamette addition at the end. After the boil, turn off the heat and chill the wort rapidly to slightly below fermentation temperature, about 65°F (18°C). Aerate the wort with pure oxygen or filtered air and pitch the yeast. Ferment at 67°F (19°C) for 7 days. Increase the temperature to 72°F (22°C) for an additional 3 days. Once the beer reaches final gravity, transfer the beer to a bottling bucket for priming and bottling or transfer to a keg. Carbonate to approximately 2 volumes.

PARTIAL MASH OPTION:
Scale the British 2-row pale malt down to 1 pound (0.45 kg) and add 4.5 pounds (2 kg) golden light liquid malt extract. Bring 2 gallons (7.6 L) of water to approximately 165°F (74°C) to stabilize the mash at 152°F (67°C). Add the milled grains in grain bags to the brewpot to mash for 60 minutes. Remove the grain bags and wash the grains with 1 gallon (4 L) hot water. Top off to 5.5 gallons (20 L) with water. Remove the brewpot from the heat and add the liquid extract while stirring. Stir until completely dissolved. Add the Willamette first wort hops addition, put your pot back on the heat, and bring the wort to a boil. Boil for 60 minutes, adding the Columbus hops at the beginning of the boil, and then the second Willamette addition at the end. Follow the remaining portion of the all-grain recipe.

2.5 lbs. (1.12 kg) wheat malt
8 oz. (224 g) crystal malt (10 °L)
8 oz. (224 g) Vienna malt
2.8 AAU Cascade hops (60 min.) (0.56 oz./16 g at 5% alpha acids)
2 AAU Hallertau hops (20 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 4% alpha acid)
0.25 oz. (7 g) Hallertau hops (dry hop)
1 oz. (28 g) dried sweetgrass leaves ("dry hop" in secondary)
Wyeast 1007 (German Ale) yeast
8 oz. (224 g) of dry malt extract (if priming)

Step by step
Crush malt and mash at 153 °F (67 °C) for 90 minutes at pH 5.3. Sparge with a little less than 3 gallons (11.4 liters) of 168 °F (76 °C) water at pH 6.2. Top up to at least 6.25 gallons (23.7 liters) to allow 1-gallon (3.8-liter) loss during boil. Bring to a boil and add Cascade hops for last 60 minutes of the boil. Add 0.5 ounce (14 gram) Hallertau hops for last 20 minutes of the boil.

When done boiling, chill with wort chiller to 65–70 °F (18–21 °C) and siphon into glass carboy. Aerate the wort and pitch a one-pint (470 mL) yeast starter. Set carboy in 58 °F place (14 °C) until primary fermentation is complete (about 2 weeks). Rack beer onto sweetgrass cut into 3-4 inch pieces and 0.25 ounce (7 g) of whole Hallertau hops in a sanitized glass carboy for secondary fermentation at 58 °F (14 °C). Allow sweetgrass and hops to soak for 3 days in secondary fermenter, then rack into a bottling bucket and add 8 ounces (224 g) of dry malt extract, pre-boiled in a pint (470 mL) of water. Bottle the batch. Allow beer to condition in the bottle for at least one month in a cool, dark place.

Partial-mash option:
Replace the 7.5 pounds (3.4 kg) of pale malt and wheat malt with 6 pounds (2.7 kg) of liquid malt extract (LME) for wheat beers. Steep Vienna and crystal malts at 153 °F (67 °C) in 2 qts. (2 L) for 45 minutes. Wash grains with 2 qts. (2 L) hot water. Bring this wort to a boil and add LME.

(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.060 (14.8 °P) FG = 1.023 (5.7 °P)
IBU = 22 SRM = 41 ABV = 4.9%

Ingredients

8.8 lb. (4 kg) Crisp British pale ale malt
14.8 oz. (420 g) lactose sugar (0 °L)
14.1 oz. (400 g) Baird’s black patent malt (525 °L)
10.6 oz. (300 g) Baird’s crystal malt (80 °L)
7.1 oz. (200 g) Thomas Fawcett & Sons pale chocolate malt (200 °L)
6 AAU Kent Goldings hop pellets (60 min.) (1.2 oz./35 g at 5% alpha acids)
White Labs WLP006 (Bedford British) or Wyeast 1099 (Whitbread Ale) yeast

Step by Step

Mill the grains and dough-in targeting a mash of around 1.5 quarts of water to 1 pound of grain (a liquor-to-grist ratio of about 3:1 by weight) and a temperature of 151 °F (66 °C). Hold the mash at 151 °F (66 °C) until enzymatic conversion is complete. Infuse the mash with near-boiling water while stirring or with a recirculating mash system raise the temperature to mash out at 168 °F (76 °C). Sparge slowly with 170 °F (77 °C) water, collecting wort until the pre-boil kettle volume is around 5.9 gallons (22.3 L) and a gravity of 1.051 (12.6 °P).

The total wort boil time is 60 minutes. I prefer to mix in the lactose with the first runnings, which gives me lots of time to make sure it gets dissolved before firing up the kettle. Add the first hop addition as soon as the wort reaches a full boil and then start your timer. Add Irish moss or other kettle finings with 15 minutes left in the boil.

Chill the wort to 68 °F (20 °C) and aerate thoroughly. The proper pitch rate is 2 packages of liquid yeast or 1 package of liquid yeast in a 2-liter starter. Ferment at 68 °F (20 °C). When finished, carbonate the beer to approximately 1.5 to 2 volumes.

OG = 1.060 (14.8 °P) FG = 1.023 (5.7 °P)
IBU = 22 SRM = 41 ABV = 4.9%

Ingredients

6.6 lb. (3.0 kg) English pale ale liquid malt extract
14.8 oz. (420 g) lactose (0 °L)
14.1 oz. (400 g) Baird’s black patent malt (525 °L)
10.6 oz. (300 g) Baird’s crystal malt (80 °L)
7.1 oz. (200 g) Thomas Fawcett & Sons pale chocolate malt (200 °L)
6 AAU Kent Goldings hop pellets (60 min.) (1.2 oz./35 g at 5% alpha acids)
White Labs WLP006 (Bedford British) or Wyeast 1099 (Whitbread Ale) yeast

Step by Step

If you cannot get fresh liquid malt extract, it is better to use an appropriate amount of dried malt extract (DME) instead.

Mill or coarsely crack the specialty malt and place loosely in a grain bag. Avoid packing the grains too tightly in the bag, using more bags if needed. Steep the bag in about 1 gallon (~4 liters) of water at roughly 170 °F (77 °C) for about 30 minutes. Lift the grain bag out of the steeping liquid and rinse with warm water. Allow the bags to drip into the kettle for a few minutes while you add the malt extract and lactose powder. Do not squeeze the bags. Add the malt extract, lactose, and enough water to make a pre-boil volume of 5.9 gallons (22.3 L) and a gravity of 1.051 (12.6 °P). Stir thoroughly to help dissolve the extract and bring to a boil.

The total wort boil time is 60 minutes. Add the first hop addition as soon as the wort reaches a full boil and then start your timer. Add Irish moss or other kettle finings with 15 minutes left in the boil. Chill the wort to 68 °F (20 °C) and aerate thoroughly. Follow the fermentation and packaging instructions for the all-grain version.

Sweet Stout I
Sweet Stout I
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.064 FG = 1.014
IBU = 25 SRM = 28 ABV = 6.8%

Ingredients

10 lbs. (4.5 kg) 2-row pale malt
0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) caramel malt (80 °L)
0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) Crisp chocolate malt
4 oz. (113 g) Briess Blackprinz® malt
1.25 lbs. (0.57 kg) lactose sugar
6.75 AAU East Kent Goldings hop pellets (90 min.)
(1.5 oz./43 g at 4.5% alpha acids)
White Labs WLP013 (London Ale) or Wyeast 1028 (London Ale) yeast
3/4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step

Mash grains at 152–154 °F (67–68 °C) with 14 qts. (13 L) water and let rest 1 hour. Run off and sparge with hot water at 160–170 °F (71–77 °C) to collect around 6 gallons (23 L) of wort. Once at a boil, add hops and boil for 90 minutes. Turn off heat and add lactose, stirring well to dissolve. Rack from trub, cool to 65–70 °F (18–21 °C) and pitch yeast, preferably as a 1 qt. (1 L) starter. Ferment at same temperature for 5–7 days before racking to secondary. Leave for 1–3 weeks before bottling or kegging in the usual manner.

Extract with grains option:
Replace all the 2-row pale malt with 6.6 lbs. (3 kg) golden liquid malt extract (LME). Steep the crushed grains in 2 gallons (7.6 L) water at 160 °F (71 °C) for 20 minutes. Rinse with 2 qts. (2 L) hot water and top off to 6 gallons (23 L). Once at a boil, turn off the heat and stir in the LME. The remainder of this recipe is the same as the all-grain version.

Tip:

If you keg this beer and have the appropriate equipment you can serve it with mixed nitrogen/carbon dioxide gas. In any case, it is a very pleasant drink, not complex perhaps, but with enough body and hint of roast so it tastes very full and chewy but not cloyingly sweet. As an elusive style, you can consider the above recipe and the additional Sweet Stout II recipe online as merely stepping-stones to formulating your own unique sweet stout.

OG = 1.046 FG = 1.014
IBU = 28 SRM = 32 ABV = 4.3 %

Ingredients
3.3 lbs. (1.5 kg) Briess unhopped light liquid malt extract
1 lb. 10 oz. (0.73 kg) light dried malt extract
11 oz. (0.31kg) crystal malt (60 ºL)
6.0 oz. (0.17 kg) chocolate malt
6.0 oz. (0.17 kg) roast barley grain
3.0 oz. (85 g) Carafa® malt
5.0 oz. (0.14 kg) dark roast coffee (medium grind)
2.5 oz. (71g) lactose powder
1/2 tsp. yeast nutrient (15 min)
7.5 AAU Galena hops (60 min.) (0.63 oz./18 g of 12.0% alpha acid)
White Labs WLP023 (Burton Ale) or Wyeast 1275 (Thames Valley Ale)
0.75 cup (150 g) of corn sugar for priming (if bottling)

Step by Step
Steep the crushed grain in 3 gallons (11.4 L) of water at 154 ºF (68 ºC) for 30 minutes. Remove grains from the wort, add the liquid extract and bring to a boil. Add the only addition of Galena hops and boil for 60 minutes. During the boil, use this time to thoroughly sanitize a fermenter. Add the yeast nutrient after 45 minutes of boiling. Dissolve in the lactose at the end of the boil. Now add the wort to 2 gallons (7.6 L) of cold water in the sanitized fermenter and top off with cold water up to 5 gallons (19 L).

Cool the wort to 75 ºF (24 ºC). Pitch your yeast and aerate the wort heavily. Allow the beer to cool to 68 ºF (20º C). Hold at that temperature until fermentation is complete. Transfer to a carboy, avoiding any splashing to prevent aerating the beer. Let the beer condition for 1 week. One day prior to bottling or kegging make a coffee extract by steeping the ground dark roast coffee in 24 oz. (0.7 L) of cold water and refrigerate. Strain out the coffee grounds, add your extract and then bottle or keg. Allow to carbonate for 2 weeks and enjoy your Giddyup Stout!

All-grain option:
This is a single step infusion mash. Replace the malt syrup and dry malt extract with 8 lbs. (3.6 kg) 2-row pale malt. The other grains remain the same. Mix the crushed grain with 4 gallons (15.2 L) of 170 °F (77 °C) water to stabilize at 154 ºF (68 ºC) for 60 minutes. Sparge slowly with 175 ºF (79 ºC) water. Collect approximately 6 gallons (23 L) of wort runoff to boil for 60 minutes. The remainder of this recipe is the same as the extract-with-grain recipe.

Tafelbier
Tafelbier
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.024 FG = 1.007
IBU = 6 SRM = 10 ABV = 2.2%

Similar to Trappist single, Tafelbier is a low-gravity session style beer with a nice Belgian character in the background that is a great beer to drink on brew days when you need to keep your wits about you but would also like to have a few beers. It also has a quick turnaround, so it’s perfect for brewing when you need a beer for a fast-approaching event.

Ingredients
2 lbs. (0.91 kg) Pilsner malt
2.1 lbs. (0.95 kg) Abbey malt (26 °L)
0.6 lb. (0.27 kg) Belgian caramel Vienna malt (25 °L)
0.4 lb. (0.18 kg) torrified wheat
0.25 lb. (113 g) Belgian aromatic malt (19 °L)
1.9 AAU Saaz hops (60 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 3.75% alpha acids)
Wyeast 3787 (Trappist Style High Gravity) or White Labs WLP530 (Abbey Ale) or Lallemand Abbaye or Safbrew BE-256 yeast
3⁄4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
This is a multi-step mash. Mill the grains, then mix with 2 gallons (7.6 L) of 154 °F (72 °C) strike water to reach a mash temperature of 144 °F (66 °C). Hold this temperature for 30 minutes. Raise the mash temperature through infusion of boiling water or recirculating system up to 158 °F (70°C). Hold this temperature for 30 minutes.

Due to the very low enzymatic power of this mash, it is recommended to perform an iodine test to confirm starch conversion before beginning to lauter. If iodine test confirms conversion, then you can raise the mash up to mash out at 172 °F (78 °C). If iodine test is negative, continue to hold at 158 °F (70 °C) until iodine test is clear. Vorlauf until your runnings are clear, then begin sparge. Sparge about 2 gallons (7.6 L) of water then top off your kettle to 6.5 gallons (24.6 L).

Boil for 90 minutes, adding hops according to the ingredient list. After the boil, whirlpool for 5 minutes, then let settle for 5 minutes. Chill the wort to about 65 °F (18 °C) and then pitch yeast and aerate wort.

Once fermentation commences, allow beer to free rise up to 70 °F (21 °C). You can hold this temperature for ten days or until the completion of primary fermentation, whichever is later. Bottle or keg the beer and carbonate to approximately 2.3 volumes.

Tafelbier
(5 gallons/19 L, partial mash)
OG = 1.025 FG = 1.008
IBU = 6 SRM = 7 ABV = 2.2%

Due to the high percentage of non-steepable malts and grains in the all-grain version of this recipe, the final beer produced with the partial mash recipe will be different than the all-grain beer. That said, this will still be a complex, yet easy-drinking beer.

Ingredients

2 lbs. (0.91 kg) Briess Goldpils Vienna liquid malt extract
1 lb. (0.45 kg) Pilsner malt
0.6 lb. (0.27 kg) Abbey malt (26 °L)
0.6 lb. (0.27 kg) Belgian caramel Vienna malt (25 °L)
0.4 lb. (0.18 kg) torrified wheat
0.25 lb. (113 g) Belgian aromatic malt (19 °L)
1.9 AAU Saaz hops (60 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 3.75% alpha acids)
Wyeast 3787 (Trappist Style High Gravity) or White Labs WLP530 (Abbey Ale) or Lallemand Abbaye or Safbrew BE-256 yeast
3⁄4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Bring 1 gallon (3.8 L) of water to approximately 165 °F (74 °C). Place crushed malts and torrified wheat in one or more grain bags and submerge in water. Temperature should stabilize around 152 °F (67 °C). Maintain this temperature for 45 minutes.

Remove the grain bag, and place in a colander. Wash grains with 1 gallon (3.8 L) hot water. Top off kettle to 5 gallons (19 L). Add the malt extract while stirring, and stir until completely dissolved. Boil for 60 minutes, adding hops according to the ingredient list.

After the boil, whirlpool for 5 minutes, then let settle for 5 minutes. Chill the wort to about 65 °F (18 °C), top off to 5.25 gallons (20 L) and then pitch yeast and aerate wort.

Once fermentation commences, allow beer to free rise up to 70 °F (21 °C). You can hold this temperature for ten days or until the completion of primary fermentation, whichever is later. Bottle or keg the beer and carbonate to approximately 2.3 volumes.

Tangerine Wheat Beer
Tangerine Wheat Beer
Courtesy of Bader Beer & Wine Supply
Vancouver, Washington

(5 gallons/19 L, extract with grains)
OG = 1.052 FG = 1.014
IBU = 30 SRM = 7 ABV = 5%

The Mandarina Bavaria hop produces distinct fruity, citrusy flavors of tangerine and when combined with tangerine peel adds a fresh fruit aroma to this beer that gives it a wonderful summertime appeal. If you want to use fresh tangerine peels, try to get only the "zest" portion of the peel, and leave the white "pith" on the tangerine. This beer will finish slightly hazy with the generous use of flaked wheat. As a lower alcohol beer this is designed for quick summertime drinking, as it loses some of the tangerine characteristic after about 6 to 8 weeks. Lower bitterness levels also make it a great beer to enjoy with a variety of lighter foods.

Ingredients
6.6 lbs. (3 kg) Bavarian wheat liquid malt extract
1.5 lbs. (0.68 kg) flaked wheat
0.75 lb. (340 g) crystal malt (20 °L)
6.5 AAU Cascade hops (60 min.) (1 oz./28 g at 6.5% alpha acids)
7 AAU HBC 438 hops (10 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 14% alpha acids)
4.5 AAU Mandarina Bavaria hops (5 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 9% alpha acids)
0.5 oz. (14 g) HBC 438 hops (0 min.)
0.5 oz. (14 g) Mandarina Bavaria (0 min.)
1 oz. (28 g) dried tangerine peel (5 min.)
Imperial Yeast A01 (House Yeast) or Lallemand Nottingham or Wyeast 1098 (British Ale) or White Labs WLP007 (Dry English Ale) yeast
3⁄4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by step
Steep crushed malted grain in a muslin bag in 3–4 gallons (11–15 L) of 150 °F (66 °C) water for 30 minutes. Remove the grain bag, allowing the liquid to drip back into the pot. Bring wort to a boil. Remove pot from burner and slowly add 1 cup of the liquid malt extract, stirring to dissolve. Return to a boil, adding hops and tangerine peel as indicated.

At the end of the boil turn off the heat, add the 0-minute hops and the remainder of your liquid malt extract. Strain the hot wort into a fermenter filled with 2 gallons (8 L) of cold water top off to the 5.5-gallon (21-L) mark. Add yeast when the temperature of your beer is less than 70 °F (21 °C), and begin fermenting. After 7 days check the specific gravity of your beer. Bottle or keg as desired as usual when the final gravity is reached.

Tart Cherry Mead
Tart Cherry Mead
(5 gallons/19 L)
OG = 1.146 FG = 1.034
ABV = 15.5%

Ingredients
2 gallons (8 L) tart cherry juice
18.1 lbs. (8.2 kg) orange blossom honey
4 g GoFerm
2 tsp. pectic enzyme
3 packages Lalvin 71B-1122 yeast
16 g Fermaid O
1.1 tsp. potassium bicarbonate
68.3 mL Super Kleer KC finings
0.28 tsp. potassium metabisulfite

Step by step
Slowly stir honey with 2 gallons (8 L) of warm water, making sure it all dissolves to create the must. Stir in fruit juice. Prepare 150 mL of warm water with GoFerm addition in it and then slowly mix in yeast. Slowly add must to the yeast-GoFerm mixture until you get its temperature within

10 °F (5 °C) of the must. Aerate the must with oxygen and an aeration stone or wand if available. Pitch the yeast-GoFerm mixture into your must and add the pectic enzyme. When working with whole fruit it can take several hours to get an accurate gravity reading, so after some time has passed, check the gravity. If needed, add a bit more water or honey to get to your target starting gravity and volume. You can optionally aerate a second time at 12 hours using oxygen.

During active fermentation you need to degas the must twice a day using a wine whip or similar device. Add 4 grams of Fermaid O nutrient at 24 hours, 48 hours, 72 hours, and the 7-day point. If you have a pH meter, monitor the pH daily and add a tsp. of potassium bicarbonate (more if needed) if the pH drops below 3.5.

After 2–3 weeks most of the fermentation will be over. At this point, transfer to a secondary to separate the mead from the sediment. Check the gravity with a hydrometer periodically. Which final gravity has been reached, transfer the mead again, and add the Super-Kleer. With fermentation complete, add 0.25–0.5 tsp. of potassium metabisulfite as an antioxidant.

Age for two months. Transfer the mead one final time once it is completely clear. At the 3-month point, the mead is usually quite pleasant to taste, and you can consider bottling or kegging.

No, not Taddy Porter, Teddy Porter — as in Teddy Roosevelt. In 1907, Teddy Roosevelt reputedly first uttered the words "good to the last drop," which became Maxwell House’s slogan. Modern historians dispute this, however, claiming that the line was really written by an ad executive. One thing beyond dispute is that you’ll be sad to see the last drop of this beer go.

(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.049 FG = 1.008
IBU = 15 SRM = 4 ABV = 5.4%

The subtle flavor of teff is quite nice in a cream ale, and you may choose to actually throw teff in the oven (spread evenly in a shallow pan, baked at 300 °F/148 °C for 15–30 minutes) to bring out a more nutty flavor and some color as well.

Ingredients
9 lbs. (4.1 kg) 2-row pale malt
1 lb. (0.45 kg) teff
0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) flaked corn
2.75 AAU Cascade hops (60 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 5.5% alpha acid)
2.75 AAU Cascade hops (10 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 5.5% alpha acid)
Fermentis US-05 or White Labs WLP001 (California Ale) or Wyeast 1056 (American Ale) yeast
3⁄4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Mill the teff to a coarse flour, milling with 2 pounds (0.91 kg) of 2-row pale malt and gelatinizing at 176 °F (80 °C). Once complete, add to mash tun and dough-in with remaining grain. Target a mash of around 1.2 quarts of water to 1 pound of grain (2.5 L/kg), and a temperature of 154 °F (68 °C) using 3.3 gallons (12.5 L) of water at 168 °F (76 °C). Hold the mash at 154 °F (68 °C) until enzymatic conversion is complete, about 60 minutes. In your hot liquor tank, bring 4.5 gallons (17 L) of water up to 170 °F (77 °C). Sparge slowly with 170 °F (77 °C) water, collecting wort until the pre-boil kettle volume is 6 gallons (23 L). Add 0.5 oz. (14 g) Cascade hops once a boil is reached. Total boil time is 60 minutes. After 50 minutes add 0.5 oz. (14 g) of Cascade hops. Boil 10 more minutes. Chill the wort to 68 °F (20 °C) and aerate thoroughly then pitch yeast. Ferment in primary at 68–70 °F (20–21 °C) for 14 days. Keg or bottle as normal.

Terje Raftevold’s kornøl (Northwest Norwegian farmhouse ale)
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.075 FG = 1.018
IBU = 0 SRM = 5 ABV = 7.5%

Ingredients
7.7 lbs. (3.5 kg) pale malt
7.7 lbs. (3.5 kg) Pilsner malt
4.5 AAU Saaz hops (0 min.) (1.6 oz./45 g at 2.8% alpha acids)
3–4 juniper branches (the tips, with berries on, if possible)
Kveik yeast (Escarpment Labs, ideally) or bread yeast

Step by Step
Lay 2–3 juniper branches in the bottom of the mashtun, then the milled malts on top. Make a juniper infusion with the last branch, with about 8-gallons (30.3-L) water brought to a boil. Mash in with juniper infusion, targeting 165 °F (74 °C) mash temperature initially with about 5.75 gallons (21.9 L), stir well, leave it 1–1.5 hours. At the end, temperature should still be 158 °F (70 °C). Sparge by adding the remaining hot juniper infusion. Let the wort run through a bag containing the hops. Cool the wort to 86 °F (30 °C), then pitch the yeast. Ideally you should make a starter with the first wort and let the sparging go on for a few hours (Terje brews 32 gallons/120 L at a time).

If fermenting with kveik, let it ferment 48 hours. With American bread yeast, 72 hours. Store cool, in a keg with spunding-valve. By controlling the storage temperature you can control the amount of post-fermentation, which will affect sweetness and also the level of carbonation. Fermented with kveik yeast, the beer is ready to drink after 48 hours.

Tips For Success:
I realize a lot of the numbers sound absurd, but that’s really the temperatures and times these people use. I’ve brewed Terje’s recipe 3–4 times, and 165 °F (74 °C) and short fermentation really does give the best results.

During the mash, be sure to stir well so that all lumps are broken up, allowing the hot water to pasteurize the malts completely. Don’t shorten the mash, because you need the time to make sure everything is pasteurized.

Remember there is no cold-side, so you really have to sanitize the mashtun, filter, juniper branches, and everything that’s used during mash and lautering. Yes, pasteurization should, in theory, take care of it, but in practice raw ale brewers are very careful with sanitation. Terje dips the juniper branches in boiling juniper infusion, for example.

IBU = 30 SRM = 21 ABV = 7.2%

Ingredients
7 lb. 10 oz. (3.5 kg) Weyermann Munich Amber liquid malt extract
4.4 lb. (2.0 kg) Weyermann Munich Type II malt (10 °L)
0.45 lbs. (0.2 kg) Weyermann Caramunich® Type I malt (35 °L)
8.0 AAU Hallertauer Mittelfrüh, Hersbrücker, Perle or Mt. Hood hops (60 mins) (1.8 oz./50 g of 4.5% alpha acid)
0.5 oz. (14 g) Hallertauer Mittelfrüh, Hersbrucker, Perle or Mt. Hood hops (5 mins)
Wyeast 2206 (Bavarian Lager), Wyeast 2308 (Munich Lager), White Labs WLP838 (Southern German Lager) or White Labs WLP920 (Old Bavarian Lager) yeast
1 cup corn sugar (for priming)

Step by Step
Divide the mixed cracked specialty grains in two muslin bags and place these into about 1.8 gallons (6.9 L) of cold water. Raise the temperature of the steeping liquid over half an hour to 162 °F (72 °C). Turn off the heat and leave the bags in the liquor for another half an hour. Lift the bags out of the liquid, rinse them with several cups of cold water and discard. Stir in the malt extract, adjust the kettle volume and bring to a boil. Because the extract has already been boiled once, there is no need for the long two-hour boil of the wort from the all-grain version. Add the bittering hops after 15 minutes and the flavor hops after 55 minutes. Shut-down after a total boil time of 75 minutes. Then follow the steps outlined in the all-grain recipe.

Ingredients
8.25 lbs. (3.7 kg) Weyermann Munich Amber liquid malt extract
3.55 lb. (1.6 kg) Weyermann Munich Type II malt (10 °L)
0.45 lbs. (0.2 kg) Weyermann Caramunich® Type I malt (35 °L)
8.0 AAU Hallertauer Mittelfrüh, Hersbrücker, Perle or Mt. Hood hops (60 mins)(1.8 oz./50 g of 4.5% alpha acid)
0.5 oz. (14 g) Hallertauer Mittelfrüh, Hersbrucker, Perle or Mt. Hood hops (5 mins)
Wyeast 2206 (Bavarian Lager), Wyeast 2308 (Munich Lager), White Labs WLP838 (Southern German Lager) or White Labs WLP920 (Old Bavarian Lager) yeast
1 cup corn sugar (for priming)

Step by Step
Heat 5.5 quarts (5.2 L) of water to 165 °F (74 °C) and pour it into a 2-gallon (7.6-L) insulated beverage cooler. Place crushed grains in a nylon steeping bag and submerge grains in cooler. Open bag and stir grains thoroughly, then close bag and cooler and let mash for 45 minutes, starting at 154 °F (68 °C). While grains are mashing, heat 3.0 quarts (2.8 L) of water to a boil in your brewpot. Also, heat 5.0 quarts of water to 180 °F (82 °C) in a separate pot.

After the grains have mashed, recirculate a couple quarts (liters) of wort until it is fairly clear, then run off first wort and add it to the boiling water in your kettle. Add 180 °F (82 °C) water to cooler, stir grains and let sit for 5 minutes.

Then recirculate and draw off second wort, adding it to the wort in your kettle. Add about 3.0 lbs. (1.4 kg) of the liquid malt extract (not all of it) to your brewpot and bring wort to a boil. Boil wort for 60 minutes, adding hops at times indicated in the ingredient list. With 15 minutes left in the boil, stir in about half of the remaining liquid malt extract. (Keep the boil clock running.) At the end of the boil, stir in the rest of the malt extract and cover your brewpot. Let it sit for 15 minutes before you cool. Cool wort. Transfer chilled wort to fermenter and top up to 5 gallons (19 L) with cold water. Pitch yeast and follow the fermentation instructions in the all-grain recipe.

Terrapin Beer Company's Wake-n-Bake Coffee Oatmeal Imperial Stout clone
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.086  FG = 1.020
IBU = 50  SRM = 49  ABV = 9.4%

Ingredients

12.25 lbs. (5.6 kg) UK 2-row pale malt
1.75 lbs. (0.79 kg) flaked oats
1.75 lbs. (0.79 kg) flaked barley
12 oz. (0.34 kg) Simpsons chocolate malt
12 oz. (0.34 kg) Thomas Fawcett dark crystal malt (85 °L)
9 oz. (0.26 kg) Simpsons roasted barley
9 oz. (0.26 kg) Simpsons black malt
1⁄2 tsp. yeast nutrient (15 min.)
1⁄2 Whirfloc® tablet (15 min.)
9.6 AAU Nugget pellet hops (60 min.) (0.75 oz./21 g at 12.8% alpha acids)
7.7 AAU Nugget pellet hops (30 min.) (0.6 oz./17 g at 12.8% alpha acids)
2.5 oz. (71 kg) Jittery Joe’s "Terrapin Wake-n-Bake" Coffee (coarsely ground)
Wyeast 1272 (American Ale II) or White Labs WLP051 (California Ale V) yeast
1/2 cup (100 g) dextrose (if priming)

Step by Step

Mill the grains (flaked oats and flaked barley don’t need to be milled) and mix with 6 gallons (23 L) of 165 °F (74 °C) strike water to reach a mash temperature of 150 °F (66 °C). Hold at this temperature for 60 minutes. Vorlauf until your runnings are clear. Sparge the grains with 3.5 gallons (13.25 L) of 169 °F (76 °C) water until 7 gallons (26.5 L) of 1.065 gravity wort is collected in your boil kettle. Boil for 75 minutes adding hops and other additions at times indicated. After the boil, turn off the heat and whirlpool the kettle by gently stirring with a mash paddle for two minutes and then let rest for an additional eight minutes to achieve a 10-minute flame out steep. Chill the wort to 66 °F (19 °C) and transfer to your fermenter. Aerate the wort with pure oxygen for 90 seconds and pitch yeast. Recommended pitch rate is 294 billion yeast cells, which can be obtained by using either 1 packet after making a 1.5-L stir plate starter, 1 packet after making a 4.4-L non-stir plate starter, or 3 vials/packets of yeast without a starter. Allow fermentation to free rise up to 68 °F (20 °C) and hold until the beer reaches 60% apparent attenuation (1.033 specific gravity) then ramp fermentation temperature up to 72 °F (22 °C) and hold at this temperature for an additional 14 days. Slowly crash cool the fermenter down at the rate of 5 °F (3 °C) per day for about 8 days or until you reach 32 °F (0 °C). Hold at this temperature for an additional 5–7 days. Then rack the beer onto the coarsely ground coffee. After 48 hours on coffee, transfer the beer into a keg or bottling bucket. Carbonate to 2.2 volumes of CO2.

Partial mash option:
Reduce the 2-row pale malt in the all-grain recipe to3.5 lbs. (1.6 kg) and add 6 lbs. (2.7 kg) golden light liquid malt extract. You will need either a small mash tun or 2 large brew-in-a-bag or paint strainer bags to make this partial mash work. Place the crushed 2-row pale malt, flaked oats, and flaked barley in the first bag. Add the grain bag to 3 gallons (7.5 L) of 160 °F (71 °C) water to reach a mash temperature of 150 °F (66 °C). Hold at this temperature for 45 minutes, then add the crystal, chocolate, barley, and black malt in the second bag. Hold 15 minutes. Remove both grain bags, and wash with 2 gallons (7.6 L) hot water, then top your kettle up to 7 gallons (26.5 L). Once you reach a boil, add your malt extract and hops. Boil for 75 minutes. Follow the remaining portion of the all-grain recipe.

Tips for Success:
If opting for North American 2-row malt in the all-grain recipe, which generally has more beta amylase than most British 2-row malt, increase your mash temperature to 154 °F (68 °C) to properly limit yeast attenuation.

For a beverage that’s only consumed by adults, craft beer is surprisingly good at playing upon nostalgia. Many of the most popular beer trends of the last decade, from milkshake IPAs to pastry stouts, explore the rich and vibrant flavors of childhood sweets in new and inventive ways. But perhaps one of the most classic childhood indulgences—especially in those parts of the country dotted with dairy farms—is a refreshing glass of chocolate milk. Striking the perfect balance between rich and wholesome, it should come as no surprise that the chocolate milk flavor profile would become a classic in the world of craft beer as well. Terrapin’s Moo-Hoo employs a generous addition of lactose sugar along with cocoa nibs from Olive and Sinclair Chocolate Company to recreate the perfect equilibrium of that American favorite, demonstrating that the pairing of dark beers and chocolaty richness can be both endlessly adaptable and enduringly simple.

Ingredients
9.5 lbs. (4.3 kg) 2-row pale malt
13 oz. (370 g) flaked oats
12 oz. (340 g) crystal malt (80 °L)
12 oz. (340 g) English chocolate malt
5 oz. (140 g) Carafa® Special III malt
3 oz. (85 g) English roasted barley
1 lb. (0.45 kg) lactose sugar (0 min.)
2–3 oz. (57–85 g) cocoa nibs
6 AAU Nugget hops (60 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 12% alpha acids)
6 AAU Nugget hops (30 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 12% alpha acids)
Wyeast 1272 (American Ale II), White Labs WLP051 (California Ale V),
or Mangrove Jack’s M36 (Liberty Bell Ale) yeast
2⁄3 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by step
Several days before brew day, begin soaking the cocoa nibs in vodka, using just enough to cover the nibs. Cover and store at room temperature.

Mash grains at 154 °F (68 °C) for 60 minutes. Begin lautering by bringing the mash up to a mash-out temperature of 168 °F (70 °F) and hold for 10 minutes. Begin recirculating, vorlaufing until the wort runs clear then direct runoff to the boil kettle.

Boil for 60 minutes adding the hops as indicated in the ingredients list and the lactose at the end of the boil. Chill wort and ferment at 68 °F (20 °C).

When the beer has finished primary fermentation, transfer to secondary and add cocoa nibs along with the vodka. Allow for up to one week of contact time to extract the desired flavor profile. After this, transfer to a keg or bottle condition.

Thai-Style Beer Marinade
Thai-Style Beer Marinade

We have enjoyed this marinade recipe many times. The combination of
the honey, beer, and spices makes it a local favorite. Best of all, it
is easy to prepare and cooks in a flash.

Ingredients:

1/3 cup peanut oil
1/2 cup honey
1/2 cup dark soy sauce
1/4 cup pilsner (or you can use a darker beer for more a malty flavor)
2 tbs. sugar
3 cloves garlic
1 tsp. Thai chilies (dried) (or use crushed red pepper flakes — or more if you dare!)
1/2 tsp. freshly grated ginger
1/2 tsp. freshly ground black pepper
11/2 tsp. dark toasted sesame oil
12 pre-soaked bamboo (or metal skewers)
11/2 lbs. favorite meat (elk in the Rockies)
Step-by-step:

Cut meat into thin strips (easier if meat is partially frozen).
Soak meat in marinade (we like using a 1-gallon zip-close bag and marinating overnight).
Skewer the strips.
Grill over high heat. Baste and turn after 1-2 minutes (metal skewers will reduce cooking time)
Serve with Thai salad or noodles.

Baked Apples (New England-style Cider)
(1 gallon/3.8 L, scale as needed)
OG = 1.068 FG = ~1.010 ABV = ~7.6%

Ingredients
0.9 gal. (3.4 L) pasteurized apple juice (12–13 °Brix /1.047-1.051 SG, which is typically bottle strength)
12 oz. (340 g) dark brown sugar
1/4 tsp. Fermaid O
5 g SafAle US-05 yeast (or similar strain)
30 g corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Mix the apple juice and brown sugar together until the sugar is dissolved. Sprinkle yeast on top and close the vessel with an airlock.

Ferment until the specific gravity reaches about 1.015 then cold crash. Once the yeast has flocculated and the active fermentation appears to have stopped, rack into a small keg and carbonate to 2.5 volumes. Opting to keep mine cold I did not stabilize with potassium metabisulfite and sorbate, but that would be necessary if the cider was being bottled or transported without temperature control.

(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.085 (1.100 after sugar additions) FG = 1.016
IBU = 90 SRM = ~60 ABV = 12%

Ingredients
15.5 lbs. (7.0 kg) organic 2-row malt
1.75 lbs. (0.80 kg) roasted barley
1.0 lb. (0.45 kg) flaked barley
1.0 lb. (0.45 kg) Special B malt
2.0 lbs. (0.91 kg) cane sugar (added during fermentation)
1.0 lb. (0.45 kg) treacle (black strap molasses will also work)
26 AAU Magnum hops (60 min.) (1.6 oz./45 g of 16% alpha acids)
2.0 oz. (57 g) E.K. Goldings hops (5 min.)
1 tsp. Whirlfloc (10 min.)
2 tsp. Wyeast yeast nutrient (10 min.)
Wyeast 1214 (Abbey Ale) or White Labs WLP500 (Trappist Ale) yeast

Step by Step
Mash in at 149–150 °F (65–66 °C) at a mash thickness around 1.20 qts. of water for one pound of grain. Let the mash rest for 60 minutes. Do not perform a mash out. Run off to the kettle, sparging with 172 °F (78 °C) water. Boil the wort for 90 minutes. At 60 minutes until the end of the boil add your bittering hops. At ten minutes until the end of the boil add whirlfloc, yeast nutrient and treacle. At five minutes until the end of the boil add your flavor and aroma hops. At the end of the boil, whirlpool or let the wort stand for ten minutes to extract a bit more flavor from the late addition hops.

Cool the wort to 70 °F (21 °C). Run cooled wort into a clean carboy that has a yeast cake from a previous brew. Oxygenate the wort for three minutes with pure oxygen through a diffusion stone. Keep the fermentation temperature between 75 and 80 °F (24 and 27 °C) for the entire fermentation. Once fermentation is approaching high kräusen, add one pound of hydrated cane sugar directly to the carboy. (On the brew day boil 2 qts./2 L of water for a few minutes and then dissolve the two pounds of sugar in it. Split the mixture into two sanitized mason jars and store in the fridge until needed.) Twenty-four hours later add 1 pound of hydrated cane sugar to the carboy. Let the beer sit in the primary fermenter for three weeks. After the three weeks rack to a secondary 5.0-gallon (19-L) carboy and cold condition cold for two months. Bottle condition to around 2.60 volumes of CO2. I use the kräusen method outlined by George and Laurie Fix on page 69 of the "Märzen, Oktoberfest, Vienna" Classic Beer Style Series books.

Extract Option:
Reduce pale malt to 2.25 lbs. (1.0 kg). Steep grains at 149–150 °F (65–66 °C) in 2.0 gallons (7.6 L) for 45 minutes. Add water to make 6.5 gallons, stir in 5.5 lbs. (2.5 kg) Cooper’s Light dried malt extract and boil the wort for 90 minutes, adding hops at times indicated. Add treacle with 10 minutes left in boil. Ferment between 75 and 80 °F (24 and 27 °C).

The Brothers Reid Scottish Ale
The Brothers Reid Scottish Ale
(5 gallons/19 L, partial mash)
OG = 1.040 FG = 1.010
IBU = 18 SRM = 11+ ABV = 3.9%

Ingredients
3 lb. 6 oz. (1.5 kg) Briess Light dried malt extract
1 lb. 10 oz. (0.74 kg) pale ale malt
0.25 lb. (0.11 kg) crystal malt (30 °L)
2.0 oz. (56 g) roasted barley (300 °L)
5.5 AAU Kent Goldings hops (60 min.) (1.1 oz./31 g of 5% alpha acids)
1 tsp. Irish moss
Wyeast 1728 (Scottish Ale) or White Labs WLP028 (Edinburgh Ale) yeast (0.75 qt./~0.75 L yeast starter)
0.75 cups corn sugar (for priming)

Step by Step
Place crushed grains in a nylon steeping bag. In a large kitchen pot, heat 3.0 qts. (2.8 L) of water to 173 °F (79 °C). Submerge grain bag in water and let steep at 162 °F (72 °C) for 15 minutes. (The temperature will drop a bit during the steep, but this won’t hurt.) While grains are steeping, heat 1.5 qts. (~1.5 L) of water to 170 °F (77 °C) in a sauce pan. Also, begin heating 2 gallons (7.6 L) of water to a boil in your brewpot. When steeping is done, place a colander over your brewpot and lift the grain bag into it. Pour the "grain tea" through the bag (which will strain out most of the grain bits), then rinse the bag with the 1.5 qts. (~1.5 L) of 170 °F (77 °C) water.

Heat the (roughly) 3 gallons (11 L) of wort in your brewpot to a boil, then stir in dried malt extract. (It will foam a bit, so don’t pour all the extract in at once.) Bring the wort back to a boil, add the hops and boil for 60 minutes. Add Irish moss with 15 minutes left in boil.

After the boil, put a lid on your brewpot and cool the wort (either in a cold-water bath in your sink or with a wort chiller). Cool until the side of the brewpot no longer feels warm. Transfer wort to your fermenter and top up to 5 gallons (19 L) with cool water. Aerate the wort and pitch your yeast. Ferment at 65 °F (18 °F). When beer falls clear, bottle with corn sugar (or keg). (In other words, skip "secondary fermentation.")

OG = 1.098 (23.4 °P) FG = 1.030 (7.5 °P)
IBU = 77 SRM = 61 ABV = 9.2%

Ingredients
11.4 lb. (5.17 kg) Edme Maris, Muntons or similar pale English liquid malt extract
22 oz. (624 g) Great Western roasted barley (500 °L)
14 oz. (397 g) Dingemans Special B (120 °L)
8 oz. (227 g) Briess caramel Munich (60 °L)
7 oz. (198 g) Briess chocolate malt (350 °L)
7 oz. (198 g) Crisp pale chocolate malt (200 °L)
15.99 AAU Horizon hops (1.23 oz./35 g at13% alpha acids) (60 min.)

Step by Step
Mill or coarsely crack the specialty malt and place loosely in a grain bag. Avoid packing the grains too tightly in the bag, using more bags if needed. Steep the bag in about 1.5 gallon (~6 liters) of water at roughly 170 °F (77 °C) for about 30 minutes. Lift the grain bag out of the steeping liquid and rinse with warm water. Allow the bags to drip into the kettle for a few minutes while you add the malt extract. Do not squeeze the bags. Add enough water to the steeping liquor and malt extract to make a pre-boil volume of 5.9 gallons (22.3 L) and a gravity of 1.084 (20.2 °P). Stir thoroughly to help dissolve the extract and bring to a boil.

The total wort boil time is 60 minutes. Add the bittering hops as soon as the wort begins to boil. Add Irish moss or other kettle finings with 15 minutes left in the boil. Add the remaining hop additions at 10 minutes and 1 minute. Chill the wort to 67 °F (19 °C) and aerate thoroughly. The proper pitch rate is 16 grams of properly rehydrated dry yeast, three packages of liquid yeast or one package of liquid yeast in a 6-liter starter.

Ferment at 67 °F (19 °C) until the yeast drops clear. Allow the lees to settle and the brew to mature without pressure for another two days after fermentation appears finished. Rack to a keg and force carbonate or rack to a bottling bucket, add priming sugar and bottle. Target a carbonation level of 2 to 2.5 volumes. Store the beer in a cool, dark place and allow to age. The beer will improve over time and should mature six or more months before drinking.

Step by Step
Mill the grains and dough-in targeting a mash thickness that will enable your system to achieve the necessary pre-boil volume and gravity. Hold the mash at 154 °F (68 °C) until enzymatic conversion is complete. Infuse the mash with near boiling water while stirring or with a recirculating mash system raise the temperature to mash out at 168 °F (76 °C). Sparge slowly with 170 °F (77 °C) water, collecting wort until the pre-boil kettle volume is around 6.5 gallons (25 L) and the gravity is 1.076 (18.4 °P). If your system loses efficiency on big beers, start with an additional 4 to 5 lbs. (2 kg) of base malt or make sure you have a couple of pounds (1 kg) or more of malt extract on hand to make up any deficiency in efficiency.

The total wort boil time is 90 minutes. Add the bittering hops with 60 minutes remaining in the boil. Add Irish moss or other kettle finings with 15 minutes left in the boil. Add the remaining hop additions at 10 minutes and 1 minute. Chill the wort to 67 °F (19 °C) and aerate thoroughly. The proper pitch rate is 16 grams of properly rehydrated dry yeast, three packages of liquid yeast or one package of liquid yeast in a 6-liter starter. Follow the remainder of the extract with grains recipe.

OG = 1.096 (24 °P) FG = 1.020 (5 °P)
IBU = 85 SRM = 18 ABV = 10%

I brewed this beer with the Manchester Area Society of Homebrewers (MASH) homebrew club at my home in Bedford, New Hampshire when I was an Assistant Brewer at Anheuser-Busch in Merrimack, New Hampshire.

Ingredients
18 lbs. (8.2 kg) Maris Otter pale malt
1.0 lb. (0.45 kg) crystal malt (60 °L)
1.0 lb. (0.45 kg) light Munich malt
13.5 AAU Columbus hops (60 min.) (1.0 oz./28 g at 13.5% alpha acids)
9.75 AAU Centennial hops (60 min.) (1.0 oz./28 g at 9.75% alpha acids)
9.75 AAU Centennial hops (15 min.) (1 oz./28 g at 9.75% alpha acids)
1.5 oz. (43 g) Cascade whole hops (5 min.)
Wyeast 1056 (American Ale) or White Labs WLP001 (California Ale) yeast (4 qt./4 L yeast starter, OG 1.030)

Step by Step
Mash ale grains in with hard water (target 300–400 ppm hardness) at 150 °F (66 °C) and hold for 60 minutes before lautering. Chill the wort to 70 °F (21 °C), pitch the yeast and ferment at 62–72 °F (16–22 °C).

Extract Option:
Replace pale malt with 8.75 lbs. (4.0 kg) Briess Light dried malt extract. Steep grains at 150 °F (66 °C) for 45 minutes in 5.5 qts. (5.2 L) of water. Add water to make 6.0 gallons (23 L), stir in dried malt extract and bring to a boil. Boil for 60 minutes, adding hops at times indicated. Chill the wort to 70 °F (21 °C), pitch the yeast and ferment at 62–72 °F (16–22 °C).

The Hammer Rye IPL
The Hammer Rye IPL
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.071 FG = 1.014 IBU = 66 SRM = 6 ABV = 8.3%
Inspired by Jack's Abby Brewing RIPL Effect, this was my attempt to brew something akin with a rye edge coming out from behind the bold hop profile. Jack's Abby used triticale, but I used a rye malt in my brew, and also used the hops I had on hand.

Ingredients
10 lbs. (4.54 kg) continental Pilsner malt
5 lbs. (2.27 kg) rye malt
8 oz. (0.23 kg) crystal malt (10 °L)
6 oz. (170 g) rice hulls
4.4 AAU Apollo hops (first wort hops) (0.25 oz./7 g at 18% alpha acids)
9 AAU Apollo hops (15 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 18% alpha acids)
9.6 AAU Columbus hops (0 min.) (0.75 oz./21 g at 13% alpha acids)
9.2 AAU Chinook hops (0 min.) (0.75 oz./21 g at 12.2% alpha acids)
4.8 AAU Cascade hops (0 min.) (0.75 oz./21 g at 6.4% alpha acids)
7.1 AAU Amarillo® hops (0 min.) (0.75 oz./21 g at 9.5% alpha acids)
1.5 oz. (43 g) Amarillo® hops (dry hop)
0.75 oz. (21 g) Chinook hops (dry hop)
0.75 oz. (21 g) Cascade hops (dry hop)
Wyeast 2007 (Pilsen Lager) or White Labs WLP840 (American Lager) yeast as a (~4 qt./4 L) starter
1 tsp. gypsum (optional if using low mineral water)
2⁄3 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
This is a single infusion mash. Heat 5.6 gallons (21.2 L) of strike water to 168 °F (76 °C) to stabilize the mash temperature at 152 °F (67 °C). Rest at this temperature for 45 minutes then begin lautering. Once you begin your run-off into your kettle add the first wort hops to the kettle. Collect 6.5 gallons (25 L) of wort, add the optional gypsum (see ingredients list) and boil for 75 minutes adding the second addition of hops with 15 minutes left in the boil.

After the boil is complete, begin a 20-minute whirlpool phase, keeping the wort hot. Rapidly chill wort to 52 °F (11 °C), pitch an appropriate yeast starter (~4 qt./
4 L) and aerate the wort thoroughly. Ferment at 52 °F (11 °C). After primary fermentation is complete (1–2 weeks), drop the temperature of the beer down to 45 °F (7 °C) and condition for one to three weeks. After conditioning, gently rack the beer into a CO2 flushed secondary vessel with flushed hops already in the vessel. Raise the temperature to 55–60 °F (13–16 °C) and wait three to seven days on the dry hops. Bottle the beer with priming sugar or rack the beer to a keg and force carbonate. Carbonate the beer to 2.4 volumes CO2.

0.75 oz. (21 g) Cascade hops (dry hop)
Wyeast 2007 (Pilsen Lager) or White Labs WLP840 (American Lager) yeast
1 tsp. gypsum (optional if using low mineral water)
2⁄3 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
I've used the Briess rye liquid malt extract which is made up of about 20% rye malt and 10% caramel malt (40 °L). This will give the beer a slightly less rye edge and a slightly more caramel flavor than the all-grain version. That said, it will still produce an amazing beer.

Add 5.5 gallons (21 L) of water plus malt extract to your kettle. When the temperature of the kettle reaches about
180 °F (82 °C), add the first wort hops to the kettle. Collect 6.5 gallons (25 L) of wort, add the optional gypsum (see ingredients list) and boil for 75 minutes adding the second addition of hops with 15 minutes left in the boil.

After the boil is complete, begin a 20-minute whirlpool phase, keeping the wort hot. Rapidly chill wort to 52 °F (11 °C), pitch an appropriate yeast starter (~4 qt./
4 L) and aerate the wort thoroughly. Ferment at 52 °F (11 °C). After primary fermentation is complete (1–2 weeks), drop the temperature of the beer down to 45 °F (7 °C) and condition for one to three weeks. After conditioning, gently rack the beer into a CO2 flushed secondary vessel with flushed hops already in the vessel. Raise the temperature to 55–60 °F (13–16 °C) and wait three to seven days on the dry hops. Bottle the beer with priming sugar or rack the beer to a keg and force carbonate. Carbonate the beer to 2.4 volumes CO2.

6.9 AAU Centennial hops (0.75 oz. /21g of 9.2% alpha acid) (15 min.)

Step by Step
Mash at 150 °F (66 °C) for 30 minutes, start lautering slowly. Collect 7.5 gallons (28 L) in the brew kettle and boil for 75 minutes adding hops as indicated. After knockout, cool the wort down to ~190 °F (88 °C) before adding the first coffee addition. Ferment at 63 °F (17 °C). After fermentation has slowed down you can add the cocoa nibs and bloomed cocoa powder directly to either the primary or secondary fermentation vessel. Let the beer sit for one more week. Using a sanitized growler, draw off a 1/2 gallon (~2 L) from the fermenter onto the second addition of coffee for a 24-hour cold extraction of the coffee beans. Place growler with beer and coffee beans in a refrigerator for 24 hours. Strain the beer back into fermenter and you're ready for bottling/kegging.

This recipe is based on some of the Barclay Perkins (1855) and Whitbread (1856) porters that were sent out to India nearly two hundred years ago. Of course, elements of the ingredients, equipment, and processes are different, and tastes have also changed over time, so in keeping with The Kernel’s philosophy, they have made a beer that contemporary beer drinkers want to drink, rather than a blindly faithful copy of a 19th century recipe.

Ingredients
9.6 lbs. (4.3 kg) Maris Otter pale ale malt (2.4 °L)
0.9 lb. (0.4 kg) brown malt (38 °L)
0.9 lb. (0.4 kg) chocolate malt (330 °L)
0.9 lb. (0.4 kg) crystal malt (60 °L)
0.4 lb. (0.2 kg) black malt (500 °L)
5.6 AAU Bramling Cross hops (first wort hop) (0.7 oz./20 g at 8% alpha acids)
5.6 AAU Bramling Cross hops (15 min.) (0.7 oz./20 g at 8% alpha acids)
8 AAU Bramling Cross hops (10 min.) (1 oz./30 g at 8% alpha acids)
11.2 AAU Bramling Cross hops (5 min.) (1.4 oz./40 g at 8% alpha acids)
2.8 oz. (80 g) Bramling Cross hops (dry hop)
1⁄2 Whirlfloc tablet (10 min.)
White Labs WLP013 (London Ale) or Wyeast 1028 (London Ale) yeast
1⁄2 cup cane sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Mill the grains and dough-in targeting a mash of around 1.3 quarts of strike water to 1 pound of grain (2.7 L/kg) and a temperature of 154 °F (68 °C). Hold the mash at 154 °F (68 °C) until enzymatic conversion is complete. Sparge slowly with 171 °F (77 °C), collecting wort until the pre-boil kettle volume is 6 gallons (23 L). Add the first wort hops during the sparging process.

Total boil time is 60 minutes, adding the remaining hops at the times indicated. Add Whirlfloc with 10 minutes left in the boil.

Chill the wort to 68 °F (20 °C) and aerate thoroughly. Pitch the yeast. Ferment at 68 °F (20 °C) until fermentation is complete. Dry hop 3 days before bottling or kegging. Carbonate the beer to around 2.4 volumes of CO2. Condition at 59–68 °F (15–20 °C), allowing time for the beer to carbonate fully.

Step by Step
Steep the crushed grains in 6 gallons (23 L) of 154 °F (68 °C) water for 30 minutes. Remove steeping bag and add liquid malt extract with the heat source off. Stir until completely dissolved. Add the first wort hops and bring wort to a boil.

Total boil time is 60 minutes, adding the remaining hops at the times indicated. Add Whirlfloc with 10 minutes left in the boil.

Chill the wort to 68 °F (20 °C) and aerate thoroughly. Pitch the yeast. Ferment at 68 °F (20 °C) until fermentation is complete. Dry hop 3 days before bottling or kegging. Carbonate the beer to around 2.4 volumes of CO2. Condition at 59–68 °F (15–20 °C), allowing time for the beer to carbonate fully.

Tips for Success:
Chocolate malt and crystal malt has replaced some of the black malt, which can sometimes produce burnt or astringent flavors. This recipe calls for lots of late hops and dry hopping and The Kernel brewery experiments with a number of different varieties. Bramling Cross (used here) give a traditional British character, but Columbus can also work well if you want more of a New World character.

We visited The Kernel Brewery in London, England last year. It is located under a truss of the London Bridge. There are 12 employees at Kernel and each takes turns brewing the beer. They brew five days a week so each employee brews every two weeks or so. They make five standard beers — a table beer, pale ale, IPA, stout, and a porter. The brewer of the day decides which hops will go into his or her beer. This change in beers has really taken off with customers who look forward to each new tweak on each beer style.

The best selling beer at Kernel is their table beer, which is a well-balanced session ale with a great hop presence, smooth body, and a surprising hoppiness for a 3.3% ABV beer. The key to this beer is the higher final gravity that balances out the US hops in the beer. It is a great summer beer that will give you the hops you want without the high alcohol content.

Ingredients
3.9 lbs. (1.8 kg) Muntons extra light dried malt extract
6 oz. (170 g) US crystal malt (20 °L)
4 oz. (113 g) Belgian aromatic malt
4 oz. (113 g) flaked oats
0.75 lb. (0.34 kg) maltodextrin powder
1.8 AAU Centennial hops (60 min.) (0.18 oz./5 g at 10% alpha acids)
4.9 AAU Simcoe® hops (10 min.) (0.375 oz./10.6 g at 13% alpha acids)
3.8 AAU Centennial hops (10 min.) (0.375 oz./10.6 g at 10% alpha acids)
0.5 oz. (14 g) Centennial hops (1 min.)
0.5 oz. (14 g) Centennial hops (dry hop)
White Labs WLP001 (California Ale) or Wyeast 1056 (American Ale) or Safale US-05 yeast
3⁄4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by step

Bring 5 gallons (19 L) brewing water in your pot up to 150 °F (66 °C). Place the crystal malt, aromatic malt, and flaked oats in a muslin bag and add to the brewing water. Steep for 30 minutes and then remove the grain bag, allowing the liquid to drip back into the pot. Remove from heat and stir in the malt extract and maltodextrin, being careful not to scorch any on the bottom of the pot. Turn heat back on once all the extract is dissolved and bring wort to a boil. Boil for 60 minutes, adding hops as indicated.

At the end of the boil, cool wort and ferment at 68–70 °F (20–21 °C). After one week in primary, transfer to a secondary fermenter (ideally a glass carboy) for two weeks, adding dry hops for the final 3 days. Bottle or keg as usual.

WLP650 (Brettanomyces bruxellensis) or Wyeast 5112 (Brettanomyces bruxellensis) yeast
1 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Mill the grains, then mix with 4.4 gallons (16.7 L) of 166 °F (74 °C) strike water to achieve a single infusion rest temperature of 152 °F (67 °C). Hold at this temperature for 60 minutes. Mashout to 170 °F (77 °C).

Vorlauf until your runnings are clear before directing them to your boil kettle. Batch or fly sparge the mash to obtain 7 gallons (26.5 L) of wort. Boil for 90 minutes, adding hops at the times indicated above left in the boil. At 15 minutes left in the boil, you can add Irish moss or Whirlfloc as kettle fining agents.

After the boil, add the corn sugar, honey, raisins, orange peel, and rosemary. Whirlpool for 15–20 minutes before chilling the wort to slightly below fermentation temperature. Pitch saison yeast. Start fermenation around 75 °F (24 °C) and ramp up as it goes. Ferment to completion, which may require a bit of patience and time. Bottle or keg the beer and carbonate to approximately three volumes using Brett Brux yeast.

The Lost Abbey Brewing Company’s Ten Commandments clone
(5 gallons/19 L, extract with grains)
OG = 1.089 FG = 1.006
IBU = 34 SRM = 29 ABV = 11%

Ingredients
5.5 lbs. (4.54 kg) extra light dried malt extract
1.5 lbs. (0.68 kg) crystal wheat malt (55 °L)
0.75 lb. (0.34 kg) Special B malt
0.75 lb. (0.34 kg) melanoidin malt
0.75 lb. (0.34 kg) flaked barley
0.4 lb. (0.18 kg) Carafa® II malt
1.4 lbs. (0.64 kg) corn sugar
1.4 lbs. (0.64 kg) honey
6.75 AAU Amarillo® hops (60 min.) (0.8 oz./23 g at 9% alpha acids)
3.25 AAU Magnum hops (45 min.) (0.25 oz./7 g at 13% alpha acids)
5 oz. (142 g) blackened raisins (see Tips for Success below)
0.5 oz. (14 g) sweet orange peel
0.026 oz. (0.75 g) fresh rosemary
WLP565 (Belgian Saison) or Wyeast 3724 (Belgian Saison) yeast
WLP650 (Brettanomyces bruxellensis) or Wyeast 5112 (Brettanomyces
bruxellensis) yeast
1 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Bring 2.5 gallons (9.5 L) of water to roughly 152 °F (67 °C). Steep all the milled malt in a nylon bag for 30 minutes then remove. Allow the bag to drain back into the kettle. Add enough water to bring the total volume to 6.5 gallons (24.6 L). Add the dried malt extract, stir, and finally heat to a boil. Follow the all-grain recipe for remaining boil, fermentation, and packaging instructions.

Tips for Success:
Ten Commandments will surely test your faith in microbiota. The brew day should be relatively straight forward except for the blackened raisins and rosemary. A subtle hand is needed for the rosemary addition as too much of the herb will unbalance the beer; The Lost Abbey uses 4 oz. (113 g) in 25 BBLs (775 gallons/29 hectoliters) of wort. As for the raisins, you’re looking for a pleasantly caramelized character that you get via brûléeing the raisins. Lost Abbey uses a large torch to accomplish this task but feel free to use safer alternatives such as a broiler.

The other major difficulty with this beer is the fermentation. The DuPont strain is notorious for stalling around 1.030. However, with a bit of patience and heat, it’ll start back up and finish fermenting. Note that the strain can tolerate fermentation temperatures up to 90 °F (32 °C). Finally, the beer is carbonated and conditioned using Brett Brux yeast. If you decide to keg the beer, you may want to consider using a funky, dedicated Brett or sour keg. Tomme recommends patience...all the flavors in the beer take months to meld together.

The Lost Abbey Brewing Co.’s Gnoel de Abbey clone
Gnoel de Abbey is a blend of two different beers. To re-create Gnoel de Abbey at home, brew both base beer styles, then blend in a 70/30 blonde-to-stout ratio. Bottle or keg what you don’t blend as standalone beers.

Gnoel de Abbey Blonde (Blending Beer)
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.048 FG = 1.008
IBU = 26 SRM = 4 ABV = 5.2%

Ingredients
9.75 lbs. (4.4 kg) American 2-row pale malt
5 oz. (0.23 kg) German Vienna malt
6.3 AAU US Magnum hops (90 min.) (0.45 oz./12.8 g at 14% alpha acids)
0.07 oz. (2 g) freshly ground coriander (15 min.)
1⁄2 tsp. Irish moss (15 min.)
White Labs WLP830 (German Lager) or Wyeast 2124 (Bohemian Lager) or Mangrove Jack’s M84 (Bohemian Lager) yeast
3⁄4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Achieve a mash temperature of 148 °F (64 °C) and mash for at least 60 minutes or until conversion is complete. Recirculate enough wort to achieve wort clarity and set the grain bed for sparging. Target a sparge water temperature of 170 °F (77 °C) and collect 7 gallons (26 L) of wort.

Boil wort for 90 minutes adding hops after hot break has ensued. Add Irish moss and coriander 15 minutes before flameout. Whirlpool and chill to 56 °F (13 °C) for fermentation. Ferment at 56 °F (13 °C) until 70–75% of the attenuation is reached. Allow fermentation to free rise to 64 °F (18 °C) for diacetyl rest.

After fermentation and diacetyl rest, cold condition the beer by dropping temperature from 64 to 59 °F (18 to 15 °C) on day one and 10 °F (5 °C) per day thereafter until reaching 32 °F (0 °C). Hold for one week and ensure all yeast and trub has been removed from the beer. When both beers are ready, rack into blending vessel and marry with the imperial stout portion of the brew in a 70/30 blonde-to-stout ratio.

3⁄4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
On brew day, target a mash temperature of 148 °F (64 °C) and mash for at least 60 minutes or until conversion is complete. Recirculate enough wort to achieve wort clarity and set the grain bed for sparging. Target a sparge water temperature of 170 °F (77 °C) and collect 7 gallons (26 L) of wort. Boil the wort for 90 minutes, adding hops after hot break has ensued. Add Irish moss and Cascade hops 15 minutes before flameout. Whirlpool and chill to 68 °F (20 °C) for fermentation.

Ferment using both yeast strains at 68 °F (20 °C) until 70–75% of the attenuation is reached, then allow to free rise to 72 °F (22 °C) to ensure beer finishes fermentation. (The English strain should produce some esters and enhance the malt in a way that the American ale strain cannot.) Add Bourbon-soaked oak chips or cubes to beer. Cold condition the beer by dropping temperature from 72 to 67 °F (22 to 19 °C) on day one and 10 °F (5 °C) per day thereafter until reaching 32 °F (0 °C). Hold for one week and ensure all yeast and trub has been removed from the beer.

Once both beers are complete, rack into a 70/30 blonde-to-stout ratio. Package beer to your preferred methods targeting carbonation levels between 2.5–2.7 volumes of CO2.

3⁄4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Using a 5-gallon (19-L) kettle, start by steeping all the specialty grains (placed in a muslin bag) in about 4 gallons (15 L) of water at 148 °F (64 °C) for 15 minutes. Remove grain bag then bring liquid to or near a boil. Turn off the flame and slowly add half of the malt extract, stirring to avoid clumping or scorching. Turn flame back on, bring to boil and immediately add bittering hops. With 15 minutes until knockout, add the remaining malt extract. Follow the remainder of the all-grain recipe for boil, fermenting, and packaging instructions. After chilling the beer, but before pitching your yeast, remember to top up with water to 5 gallons (19 L).

Tips for Success: While The Lost Abbey may have the luxury of using oak barrels for their barrel aging, most homebrewers need to find a more efficient way to replicate the process. About two weeks before your brew day, soak 4 oz. (113 g) of oak chips or cubes in Bourbon so the chips have time to absorb the Bourbon character. Using American oak may provide the closest replication to The Lost Abbey’s beer, but any origin of oak is acceptable, depending on what specific character the brewer is seeking to achieve.

IBU = 35  SRM = 4  ABV = 5.9%

This Belgian-style blonde ale is light bodied and hop driven. It has a low level of yeast phenols and instead a lot of the spicy character comes from the aromatic hops.

Ingredients
7.25 lbs. (3.3 kg) Pilsner malt
0.54 lbs. (0.24 kg) Crisp crystal malt (15 °L)
1.48 lbs. (0.67 kg) dextrose (15 min.)
6.25 AAU Warrior® hops (90 min.) (0.39 oz./11 g of 16% alpha acids)
1.95 AAU Brewers Gold hops (45 min.) (0.32 oz./9.2 g at 6% alpha acids)
1.9 AAU Brewers Gold hops (15 min.) (0.31 oz./8.9 g at 6% alpha acids)
0.81 oz. (23 g) German Tettnang hops (0 min.)

3⁄4 cup (150 g) dextrose (if priming)

Step by Step
Crush your grains and mash at 146 °F (63 °C) for 60 minutes. Mash out, vorlauf, and then sparge at 170 °F (77 °C) to collect approximately 7 gallons (26.6 L) of wort. Boil for 90 minutes, adding hops at times indicated and sugar for final 15 minutes. After the boil is complete, add the whirlpool hops, stir, and let sit for 15 minutes prior to cooling. Ferment starting at 66 °F (19 °C), but allow the temperature to rise without control. Bottle or keg as normal.

Extract with grains option: Substitute the Pilsner malt in the all-grain recipe with 5 lbs. (2.3 kg) Weyermann Pilsner liquid malt extract. Steep crushed malts in 3 gallons (11 L) of water as the water heats up to 160 °F (71 °C). Combine "grain tea" with enough water in brewpot to make 5 gallons (19 L) of wort. Boil 60 minutes, adding hops at times indicated and sugar and liquid malt extract for final 15 minutes. Follow the remaining portion of the all-grain recipe.

Theodore Hamm’s Brewing Company's Hamm’s clone
(6 gallons/23 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.040 FG = 1.006
IBU = 20 SRM = 3.2 ABV = 4.5%

Hamm’s is crisp, refreshing and very light in color and body. It typically has very high carbonation levels that cover any sweetness that might be present. This beer is brewed with a double mash and is diluted upon packaging as all American-style Pilsners are. You ferment 5 gallons (19 L) of base beer, but yield 6 gallons (23 L) in the keg.

Ingredients
7.8 lbs. (3.5 kg) 6-row pale malt
3 lbs. (1.4 kg) brewer’s corn grits
2.4 AAU Hallertau hops (60 min.) (0.6 oz./17 g at 4% alpha acids)
2.7 AAU Tettnanger hops (60 min.) (0.6 oz./17 g at 4.5% alpha acids)
2.4 AAU Hallertau hops (5 min.) (0.6 oz./17 g at 4% alpha acids)
1/2 teaspoon Irish moss (15 min.)
White Labs WLP840 (American Lager) or Wyeast 2035 (American Lager) yeast
7/8 cup (175 g) dextrose (if priming)

Step by Step
Reserve a handful of 6-row malt. Mash in remaining malt with 4.1 gallons (16 L) of water at 133 °F (56 °C) and begin mashing at 122 °F (50 °C) in your kettle. Combine corn with the handful of 6-row malt in 1 gallon (3.8 L) of water in a large kitchen pot and begin heating it. Rest cereal mash at 158 °F (70 °C) for 5 minutes, then bring to a boil. Boil for 30 minutes, stirring almost constantly. Heat the main mash, stirring often, to 140 °F (60 °C) and hold. Combine cooked corn with main mash and adjust temperature — if needed — to 152 °F (67 °C). Hold at 152 °F (67 °C) for 30 minutes, stirring often. Heat mash to 168 °F (76 °C), stirring often, and transfer mash to lauter tun, recirculate and run off wort. Sparge with water hot enough to keep grain bed at 170 °F (77 °C ). Collect about 5 gallons (19 L) of wort, add 1.5 gallons (5.7 L) of water and bring to a vigorous, rolling boil. Boil the wort down to 5 gallons (19 L) over 90 minutes, adding hops and Irish moss at times indicated. Cool wort to 48 °F (9 °C) and transfer to fermenter. Aerate wort and pitch yeast from starter. Ferment at 52 °F (11 °C), allowing temperature to rise to 60 °F (16 °C) when fermentation is almost finished. Hold for 3 days at this temperature. Separate beer from yeast and cool to 40 °F (4.4 °C). Allow to cold condition (lager) for 4–5 weeks. When you are ready to keg the beer, boil a little over 1 gallon (3.8 L) of water for 15 minutes, cool rapidly and add 3.3 qts. (3.2 L) to your 5-gallon (19-L) Corny keg. Transfer beer to keg until it is full. You will be left with 3.3 qts. (3.2 L) of base beer to either dilute to 4 qts. (3.7 L) with boiled and cooled water or to package as "malt liquor."

Extract with grains option:
Substitute the corn grits and reduce the 6-row pale malt in the all-grain recipe with 2 lbs. (0.91 kg) 6-row pale malt, 3.3 lbs. (1.5 kg) light liquid malt extract 1 lb. (0.45 kg) flaked maize, and 0.75 lb. (0.34 kg) corn sugar. Steep the 6-row and flaked maize in 5 gallons (19 L) of water at 150 °F (65 °C) for 45 minutes. Remove grains and rinse with 2 qts. (2 L) of 170 °F (77 °C) water. Add the malt extract and boil for 60 minutes. With 5 minutes remaining, add the corn sugar. Follow the remaining portion of the all-grain recipe.

The Olde Country (New England-style Cider)
(1 gallon/3.8 L, scale as needed)
OG = 1.062 FG = ~1.010 ABV = ~7%

Ingredients
0.9 gal. (3.4 L) pasteurized apple juice (12–13 °Brix /1.047-1.051 SG, which is typically bottle strength)
8 oz. (240 mL) unsulfured molasses
8 oz. (227 g) golden raisins, chopped
1/4 tsp. Fermaid O
5 g SafAle US-05 yeast (or similar strain)
30 g corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Mix the apple juice, raisins, and molasses together until the molasses is dissolved. Sprinkle yeast on top and close the vessel with an airlock.

Ferment until the specific gravity reaches about 1.015 then cold crash. Once the yeast has flocculated and the active fermentation appears to have stopped, rack into a small keg and carbonate to 2.5 volumes. Opting to keep mine cold I did not stabilize with potassium metabisulfite and sorbate, but that would be necessary if the cider was being bottled or transported without temperature control.

Combine water in brewpot, "grain tea" from steep and dried malt extract and bring to a boil. Boil for 90 minutes, adding hops at beginning of boil. Don’t let wort volume drop below 2.5 gallons (9.5 L) during the boil. (Add water, if so.) Stir in liquid malt extract during the final 10 minutes. Add spices when boil is finished and let them steep for 5 minutes prior to cooling wort. Cool wort, transfer to fermeter and top up to 5 gallons (19 L). See all-grain recipe for remaining instructions.

Ingredient notes: Get chamomile flowers at a spice store, health food shop, tea shop or craft store. Google "buy dried chamomile flowers" to find online sources. Chamomile tea is usually pure chamomile flowers (check the ingredient list). Use only the orange zest of the tangerines. Do not use the white pith. Using broken pieces of star anise is cheaper; use the equivalent of one whole star.

Navish’s Oatmeal Stout clone
The Portsmouth Brewery, New Hampshire
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.065 FG = 1.025
IBU = 50 SRM = 35 ABV = 5.3%

Ingredients
11 lbs. (5 kg) pale malt
1 lb. (0.45 kg) caramel malt (60 °L)
0.2 lb. (91 g) chocolate malt
0.2 lb. (91 g) black malt
0.8 lb. (0.36 kg) roasted barley
1 lb. (0.45 kg) rolled quick oats
0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) steel-cut oats (45 min.)
14 AAU Chinook hops (75 min.) (1.2 oz./33 g of 12% alpha acids)
Wyeast 1084 (Irish Ale) or White Labs WLP004 (Irish Ale) yeast
0.75 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Mash the grains and rolled oats at 160 °F (71 °C) for one hour and then sparge and run off enough wort into the kettle for a 90-minute boil. Add 1.2 ounce (33 g) of Chinook hops at 15 minutes into the boil. Add 0.5 lbs. (0.23 kg) of steel-cut oats (Irish oatmeal) in a mesh bag to the boil during the last 45 minutes. Remove bag of Irish oatmeal and cool wort. Move cooled wort to fermenter and add Irish stout yeast. Ferment at 65–68 °F (18–20 °C) until reaching terminal gravity (about 7–12 days).

The Queen's Mead Recipe
OG = 1.073 FG = 0.998 ABV = 9.8%

Bitten by the meadmaking bug during the pandemic, Paul Crowther set out to make a historic mead. Not just any mead steeped in history, but one said to have been enjoyed by Queen Elizabeth I and possibly created by ancient Celts who occupied Britain more than 1,000 years earlier.

Ingredients
2.8 lbs. (1.5 kg) raw wildflower honey
1 gallon (3.8 L) water
0.15 oz. (4.3 g) briar leaves
0.15 oz. (4.3 g) thyme
0.075 oz. (2.1 g) rosemary
0.037 oz. (1 g) bay leaves
0.037 oz. (1 g) powdered mace
0.037 oz. (1 g) powdered cloves
Yeast nutrient (optional)
White Labs WLP013 (London Ale) or Mangrove Jack’s M15 (Empire Ale) yeast

Step by step
Boil the briar leaves, bay leaves, thyme, and rosemary in the water for 30 minutes. Leave the water to cool to 68 °F (20 °C) and then strain out the herbs. Add the honey to the water and mix well. Try to float a small hen’s egg in your must. If it does not float add more honey until it does. Alternatively, ensure gravity is at least 1.073. Decant the must into your fermenting vessel.

At this point, you have the option of adding 1 tsp. of yeast nutrient. This will make the recipe less historically accurate, however will aid the fermentation process greatly.

After three days pour the mead back into a pot and boil for five minutes. Either decant back into a clean fermenting vessel and pitch yeast as per the manufacturer instructions or for a more historically accurate recreation, if you homebrew beer, ensure you have a batch of ale fully fermented and ready for racking. Rack your beer and then decant your mead directly onto the ale trub. If using the trub method, after three days rack the mead back into a clean fermenting vessel. Once in fermenting vessel add the cloves and mace. Wait for the mead to ferment fully and bottle. Bottle age for at least six months before drinking.

Notes
The finished beverage is light and refreshing, dry with herbal and floral notes dancing across the palate. It’s the color of pale straw or a sunrise just before the sun breaks the horizon. I first brewed this recipe a year ago and have still got five bottles stashed away in a corner of my garage — I suspect it will only get better with age.

I can imagine sitting in Butler’s bee garden, sharing a bottle whilst he excitedly tells me some interesting bee-related fact, or perhaps in a wattle and daub roundhouse passing around a horn with some Celtic tribesmen. I’ve become a part of this 1,500 years of history through making this mead, and if you choose to remake it you will be too.

Joseph Schlitz Brewing Company: Schlitz Gusto (circa 1960's) clone
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.046 FG = 1.010
IBU = 30 SRM = 3 ABV = 4.7%

"The beer that made Milwaukee famous," and the beer that your father probably used to drink. This is a clone recipe of the 60s-era Schlitz, when Schlitz was the largest brewery in the world and before the infamous "reformulation" done in the 1970s.

Ingredients
5.5 lbs. (2.5 kg) North American Pilsner malt
2 lbs. (0.91 kg) 6-row pale malt
2 lbs. (0.91 kg) flaked maize
1.75 AAU Cluster hops (60 min.) (0.55 oz./16 g at 7% alpha acids)
1.75 AAU Cluster hops (10 min.) (1.1 oz./32 g at 7% alpha acids)
1/4 tsp. calcium chloride
1/4 tsp. gypsum
1 tsp. Irish moss (15 min.)
Wyeast 2035 (American Lager) or White Labs WLP840 (American Lager) yeast (3 qt./~3 L yeast starter)
1 cup (200 g) dextrose (if priming)

Step by Step
This recipe calls for a multi-step mash infusion schedule. Starting with RO water, add the calcium chloride and the gypsum. Dough-in the grains at 113 °F (45 °C) with 14.3 qts. (13.5 L) of water. Immediately begin heating mash to 145 °F (63 °C). Stir mash while heating. Rest for 15 minutes at 145 °F (63 °C), then heat mash to 154 °F (68 °C) and rest for 30 minutes (or until iodine test shows negative). Heat to 167 °F (75 °C) and transfer to lauter tun. Let mash sit for 5 minutes, then recirculate for 20 minutes (or until clear). Sparge with 170 °F (77 °C) water and collect roughly 5 gallons (19 L) of wort, add 1.5 gallons (5.7 L) of water and bring to a boil. Boil for 90 minutes, adding hops and Irish moss as indicated. Cool wort to 55 °F (13 °C), transfer to fermenter, aerate thoroughly and pitch yeast. Let ferment at 55 °F (13 °C) until fermentation slows, then allow temperature to rise to 60 °F (16 °C). After three days (or after sampling the beer and detecting no diacetyl), separate beer from yeast, cool beer to 40 °F (4.4 °C) and begin lagering. Allow to lager for 6 weeks, then keg and force carbonate to 2.6 volumes of CO2.

Partial mash option:
Replace the Pilsner malt from the recipe with 3 lbs. (1.4 kg) Pilsen dried malt extract and 0.5 lb. (230 g) of corn sugar. Heat 6 quarts (5.7 L) water to 164 °F (73 °C) and submerge crushed 6-row and flaked maize in a large steeping bag. Stir and then let partial mash rest, starting at 153 °F (67 °C) for 45 minutes. While the partial mash is resting, heat 1 gallon (3.8 L) of water to a boil in your brewpot and heat 5.5 qts. (5.2 L) of water to 180 °F (82 °C) in a large soup pot. Recirculate about 2 qts. (2 L) of wort, then run off first wort and add to boiling water in brewpot. Add the 180 °F (82 °C) water to the cooler until liquid level is the same as before. Stir grains, let rest 5 minutes, then recirculate and run off wort as before. Add corn sugar and bring wort to a boil. Once hot break forms, add hops and boil for 60 minutes. Follow the remaining portion of the all-grain recipe.

(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.045 FG = 1.006
IBU = 13 SRM = 4 ABV = 5.2%

This is a beer formulated with some information I received about how Schlitz was brewed in 1975. I simplified this formulation by using flaked maize and specifiying that the beer be fermented at working strength, rather than using high gravity brewing.

Ingredients
4 lbs. (1.8 kg) 2-row pale malt
2 lb. 10 oz. (1.2 kg) 6-row pale malt
2 lb. 14 oz. (1.3 kg) flaked maize
1/4 tsp. calcium chloride (90 min.)
1 tsp. Irish moss (15 min.)
1.75 AAU Cluster hops (60 min.) (0.25 oz./7 g of 7% alpha acids)
1.75 AAU US Fuggles hops (60 min.) (0.35 oz./10 g of 5% alpha acids)
Wyeast 2035 (American Lager) yeast (3 qt./~3 L yeast starter)
3/4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
In kettle, mash in to 113 °F (45 °C) with 3.5 gallons (13 L) of water. Immediately begin heating mash to 145 °F (63 °C). Stir mash while heating. Rest for 15 minutes at 145 °F (63 °C), then heat mash to 154 °F (68 °C) and rest for 30 minutes (or until iodine test shows negative). Heat to 167 °F (75 °C) and transfer to lauter tun. Let mash sit for 5 minutes, then recirculate for 20 minutes (or until clear).

Sparge with 170 °F (77 °C ) water and collect roughly 5 gallons (19 L) of wort, add 1.5 gallons (5.7 L) of water and 1/4 tsp. of calcium chloride and bring to a boil. Boil for 90 minutes, adding all hops with 60 minutes left in boil. Add Irish moss with 15 minutes left.

Cool wort to 55 °F (13 °C), transfer to fermenter, aerate thoroughly and pitch yeast. Let ferment at 55 °F (13 °C) until fermentation slows, then allow temperature to rise to 60 °F (16 °C). After three days (or after sampling the beer and detecting no diacetyl), separate beer from yeast, cool beer to 40 °F (4.4 °C) and begin lagering. Allow to lager for 6 weeks, then keg and force carbonate to 2.6 volumes of CO2.

(5 gallons/19 L, partial mash)
OG = 1.068 FG = 1.024
IBU = 24 SRM = 35 ABV = 5.8%

Ingredients
4.5 lbs. (2 kg) extra light dried malt extract
1 lb. (0.45 kg) maltodextrin powder
10 oz. (283 g) crystal malt (20° L)
10 oz. (283 g) crystal malt (80° L)
10 oz. (283 g) crystal malt (120° L)
1 lb. (0.45 kg) chocolate malt
1.5 lbs. (0.68 kg) Munich malt (20° L)
12 oz. (336 g) flaked barley
5.75 AAU German Northern Brewer hops (60 min.)(0.64 oz./18 g of 8% alpha acids)
5 AAU Liberty hops (5 min.) (1.5 oz./43 g at 3.7% alpha acid)
Wyeast 1028 (London Ale) or White Labs WLP023 (Burton Ale) or White Labs WLP013 (London Ale)
1/2 teaspoon isinglass for fining
3/4 cup corn sugar for priming

Step by Step
Steep the grains in 8 quarts (7.6 L) of water at 150 ºF (66 °C) for 30 minutes. Rinse the grains with 1 gallon (3.8 L) of water at 170 °F (77 °C). Add water to make 3 gallons (11 L), stir in the maltodextrin and malt syrup and return to a boil. When the wort begins boiling, add Northern Brewer hops and boil for 60 minutes. Add the Liberty hops for the last 5 minutes of the boil.

Cool wort in an ice bath or with wort chiller. Transfer to primary fermenter and add enough cold water to bring the volume up to 5.25 gallons (20 L). Pitch yeast and oxygenate-aerate well. Ferment this beer on the warm side, at 72 ºF (21 °C) as per the brewer’s instructions, for 7 to 10 days. Add the isinglass to the beer after fermentation is complete to help achieve clarity. Prime, bottle and age for about two weeks.

All-Grain Option: Replace the malt syrup and malto-dextrin with 9 lbs. (4.1 kg) of pale malt and 1.25 lbs. (0.57 kg) of dextrin malt. Mash the grains together. Fred says Thirsty Dog uses a simple single-infusion mash at 155 ºF (68 °C) for this beer. I would suggest 60 minutes. Change the boiling hops to 6 AAU German Northern Brewer hops (0.75 ounce at 8% alpha acid). Note that the boiling hops are slightly lower for the all-grain batch, due to greater hop extract efficiency from a full boil of the entire wort. Ferment and condition as described in the extract-with-grains instructions.

A bit more chocolate malt than you’d usually see in a traditional mild makes this collaboration beer unique (though you’d lose points from a BJCP judge). Dominic Driscoll, Production Manager at Thornbridge, noted he was aware of this but that their patrons prefer the more roasted character this imparts. The Slovenian hops are also the brewer’s preference. Swap them for English Golding hops if you wish.

Ingredients
5.5 lbs. (2.5 kg) Maris Otter pale ale malt
0.5 lb. (230 g) chocolate malt
5.6 oz. (159 g) wheat malt
5.6 oz. (159 g) medium crystal malt (90 °L)
3.5 oz. (100 g) dark crystal malt (135 °L)
11.5 oz. (325 g) Lyle’s Golden Syrup
6.3 AAU Fuggle hops (60 min.) (1.4 oz./40 g at 4.5% alpha acids)
1.6 oz. (45 g) Styrian Golding hops (0 min.)
White Labs WLP002 (English Ale), Wyeast 1968 (London ESB Ale), or LalBrew London yeast
1⁄3 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by step
Mash crushed grains at 153 °F (68 °C) for 60 minutes. Batch sparge for 15 minutes at 162 °F (72 °C). Collect 6.5 gallons (24.5 L) of wort in the brew kettle. Turn off heat and slowly pour in Golden Syrup while constantly stirring, making sure to stir in thoroughly until dissolved in order to avoid scorching.

Bring wort to boil for a standard 60-minute boil, adding hops as indicated in the ingredients list. When the boil is complete, cool wort down to 65 °F (18 °C) and transfer to fermentation vessel. Add yeast as packet directs.

Bottle conditioning English mild is much more traditional than force carbonating in a keg, but either way mild is best served at lower carbonation levels. Aim for 1.5–2.0 volumes of carbonation.

18 mL CO2 hop extract (Start of boil) (62% alpha acids)
1 tablet Whirlfloc® tablet (10 min)
0.5 tsp. Yeastex nutrient (10 min)
2 Mexican vanilla beans
2.5–5 oz. (71-142 g) coffee beans
2 packs Wyeast 1968 (London ESB Ale) or White Labs WLP002 (English Ale) yeast
2 packs Wyeast 1056 (American Ale) or White Labs WLP001 (California Ale) yeast
Lallemand CBC-1 or other high alcohol tolerant yeast strain (if priming)
2⁄3 cup (133 g) dextrose (if priming)

Step by Step
Before brew day, pitch two packs each of Wyeast 1968 and 1056 (White Labs WLP002 and WLP001, respectively) into a 0.8 gallon (3 L) yeast starter on a stir plate (Equates to pitching rate of 1 million cells per mL wort per degree Plato). When yeast flocculates, place the starter in the fridge and store until brew day. The brew day will require two mashes, referred to here as Mash #1 and Mash #2.

On brew day, mill 16.7 lbs. (7.6 kg) of pale ale malt and dough-in with 22.25 quarts hot water (21.1 L), targeting a mash at 159 °F (70.6 °C) (Mash #1). Hold until enzymatic conversion is complete. If your system allows, raise the mash temperature to 168 °F (76 °C) and recirculate the wort until clear. Sparge with 170 °F (77 °C) water to collect 6.5 gallons (25 L) of wort. If your boil off volume is greater than 10% per hour, adjust the amount of wort you collect accordingly. Take a specific gravity reading and, if needed, add light dried malt extract to reach a specific gravity of 1.065. Heat to a boil and add the hop extract. Boil for 4 hours.

Time Mash #2 so that the wort from Mash #1 has boiled for at least 4 hours before you begin to collect the first runnings from Mash #2 into the boil kettle. For Mash #2 mill 11.1 lbs. (5 kg) of pale ale malt along with the remaining grain and dough-in with 22.25 quarts of hot water (21.1 L), targeting a mash at 159 °F (70.6 °C). Hold until enzymatic conversion is complete. If your system allows, raise the mash temperature to 168 °F (76 °C) and recirculate the wort until clear. Collect 3.5 gallons (13.2 L) of first runnings wort in the boil kettle to reach a total volume of 6.5 gallons (25 L). If necessary, sparge with 170 °F (77 °C) water to bring the volume up to 6.5 gallons (25 L) of wort. The specific gravity of the wort in the kettle at this point should be about 1.124. Boil for 90 minutes adding Whirlfloc, yeast nutrient, and sugar at 10 minutes. Before cooling, take a specific gravity reading and, if needed, add light dried malt extract to reach a specific gravity of 1.169 and a final volume of 5.5 gallons (20.7 L).

Chill the wort to 62 °F (16.7 °C). Oxygenate with pure oxygen for 90 seconds before pitching the yeast starter (decanting the spent wort first). Ferment at 62–64 °F (16.7–17.8 °C). After 12–24 hours of fermentation, oxygenate with pure oxygen for 60 seconds. Hold the fermentation temperature at 62–64 °F (16.7-17.8 °C) for 7 to 10 days before raising the temperature up to 70 °F (21.1 °C) for 7 days to perform a diacetyl rest and ensure a complete fermentation (final specific gravity of ~1.055). Rack to secondary fermenter and leave for 1 to 3 weeks. (Due to extreme viscosity, racking this beer can take an incredibly long time).

Before or after racking the beer to the secondary, prepare a vanilla bean tincture: Cut open two Mexican vanilla beans, making sure to scrape out the seeds, and cut the pods into pieces. Place the vanilla seeds and pods into just enough neutral spirit (like vodka) to cover, and age for 5 days before adding it directly to the secondary fermenter. Age the beer with vanilla bean tincture for a minimum of 3 days.

If barrel aging, rack the beer into barrel after secondary fermentation and age to taste. My "brandy barrel aged with vanilla beans" version of this beer was aged in a brandy barrel with an additional vanilla bean tincture for six months before kegging (read on).

If bottling add 2.5–5 oz. (71-142 g) of whole Intelligentsia Black Cat (pre-2014 Dark Lord) or Dark Matter Unicorn Blood (2014–2015 Dark Lord) coffee beans (in a muslin bag) to the beer in secondary fermenter and age for 24 to 48 hours, preferably at 38 °F (3 °C). Rack the beer to a bottling bucket and add a fresh packet of yeast to assure proper carbonation. Lallemand CBC-1 and Safale US-05 are two good options that can handle the high ABV. Carbonate aiming for a carbonation level of 2–2.2 volumes of CO2. Once carbonated, condition the beer at cellar temperature for several months.

If kegging, add 2.5–5 oz. (71-142 g) of whole Intelligentsia Black Cat (pre-2014 Dark Lord) or Dark Matter Unicorn Blood (2014–2015 Dark Lord) coffee beans (in a muslin bag) to empty keg and rack the beer into a keg, aging on coffee beans for 24 to 48 hours, preferably at 38 °F (3 °C). Remove the beans and aim for a carbonation level of 2–2.2 volumes of CO2. Once carbonated, condition at cellar temperature for several months.

Partial mash option:
Substitute the pale ale malt in the all-grain recipe with 14.6 lbs. (6.6 kg) Briess extra light dried malt extract and 9.4 oz. (266 g) Weyermann Carafoam® malt. Prepare yeast starts as described in the all-grain recipe. On brew day, crush the steeping grains and place them in two steeping bags. Steep the bags at 155 °F (68 °C) in 20 quarts (18.9 L) of water for 20 minutes. Rinse the grains with 4 quarts (3.8 L) of 170 °F (77 °C) hot water. Add dried malt extract (DME) and water to achieve a pre-boil volume of 6.5 gallons (25 L). Boil for 60 minutes, adding the hop extract, sugar and yeast nutrients at the specified times. Follow the remaining portion of the all-grain recipe.

This light yellow German-style ale is no longer brewed by Thunder Island, but you can brew it at home for a fresh, crisp brew for the summer.

Ingredients
8.5 lbs. (3.8 kg) 2-row pale malt
8 oz. (0.23 kg) white wheat malt
8 oz. (0.23 kg) Munich malt
6.2 AAU Magnum hop pellets (50 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 12.3% alpha acids)
1/2 tsp. Irish moss (15 min.)
1/2 tsp. yeast nutrient (15 min.)
White Labs WLP029 (German Ale/Kölsch) or Wyeast 2565 (Kölsch) yeast
¾ cup (150 g) dextrose (if priming)

Step by Step
Mash the crushed grains with 3.5 gallons (13 L) of 170 °F (77 °C) water to stabilize at 150 °F (66 ºC) for 60 minutes. Slowly sparge with 175 °F (79 °C) water. Collect approximately 6 gallons (23 L) of wort runoff to boil for 60 minutes. Add the hops, Irish moss, and yeast nutrient as per the schedule. Cool the wort to 75 °F (24 °C). Pitch your yeast and aerate the wort heavily. Allow the beer to cool to 68 °F (20 °C). Hold at that temperature until fermentation is complete. Transfer to a carboy, avoiding any splashing to prevent aerating the beer. Allow the beer to condition 1 week and then bottle or keg.

Extract with grains option:
Reduce the 2-row pale malt to 2 lbs. (0.9 kg) and add 3.3 lbs. (1.5 kg ) Muntons extra light liquid malt extract and 0.75 lb. (0.34 kg) Muntons light dried malt extract. Steep the crushed grain in 2.5 gallons (9.5 L) of water at 150 °F (66 °C) for 30 minutes. Remove grains from the wort and rinse with 2 quarts (1.9 L) of hot water. Add the malt extracts and boil for 60 minutes, adding hops, Irish moss, and yeast nutrient as per the schedule. When done, add the wort to 2 gallons (7.6 L) of cold water in a sanitized fermenter and top off with cold water up to 5 gallons (19 L). Follow the remaining portion of the all-grain recipe.

De-husked roasted malts like Carafa® III are an ideal solution to darken the color of schwarzbiers as they don’t have any sharp acrid notes as highly kilned malts do. This makes a surprisingly smooth dark lager.

Ingredients
5 lbs. (2.27 kg) German Pilsner malt
4 lbs. (1.8 kg) German Munich II malt (9 °L)
6 oz. (170 g) Weyermann Carafa® III Special malt (525°L)
5 oz. (140 g) Carapils®/Carafoam® malt
6.5 AAU Herkules hops (60 min.) (0.45 oz./13 g at 14.5% alpha acids)
0.7 AAU Perle hops (15 min.) (0.1 oz./2 g at 6.5% alpha acids)
0.5 AAU Saaz hops (5 min.) (0.1 oz./2 g at 4.5% alpha acids)
Lallemand Diamond Lager or Wyeast 2487 (Hella Bock Lager) or White Labs WLP833 (German Bock Lager) yeast
2⁄3 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step

This recipe uses a multi-step infusion mash. Dough in at around 104 °F (40 °C) for a hydration rest of 15 minutes. Raise the temperature to 122 °F (50 °C) for a protein rest of 15 minutes. Raise the temperature to 149 °F (65 °C) for a beta amylase rest of 30 minutes. Raise the temperature to 162 °F (72 °C) for an alpha amylase rest of 30 minutes. Raise temperature to 169 °F (76 °C) for the mash-out. Recirculate wort then begin sparge.

Boil for 75 minutes, adding hops as indicated. At the end of the boil, turn off heat and whirlpool for 15 minutes. Heat-exchange to the high end of the temperature range for the selected yeast. As soon as primary fermentation is vigorous, reduce the tank temperature to the low end of the yeast’s temperature range. After 7 additional days, give the beer a diacetyl rest by raising the tank temperature to 66 °F (19 °C) and hold it there for about 2 days. Rack and reduce the beer temperature for lagering by 2 °F (1 °C ) a day until reaching 31 °F (–1 °C) or close to it, equipment permitting. The lagering temperature should definitely not be higher than 38 °F (3.5 °C). Lager for 4 to 6 weeks. Some brewers may shorten the lagering time to 2 to 4 weeks, others will lengthen it to 12 weeks. Rack again. Carbonate to approximately 2.3 volumes of CO2.

The inspiration for this beer was a play on De Baets’ remarks that traditional saisons were low gravity and heavily hopped. When it was still brewed with the Rodenbach strain, De Ranke’s XX Bitter was a rough approximation of a traditional saison, but with its cleaner character today you’ll have to brew your own for a taste of history. This recipe makes for a refreshing summer beer with the gravity dialed down and aromatics pushed to the fore.

Ingredients
7.5 lbs. (3.4 kg) Pilsner malt
0.50 lbs. (0.23 kg) flaked wheat
6 AAU Sterling hops (60 min.) (0.75 oz./21 g of 8% alpha acids)
4 AAU Hallertauer hops (10 min.) (1.0 oz./28 g of 4% alpha acids)
1 oz. (28 g) Hallertauer hops (0 min.)
0.75 oz. (21 g) Sterling hops (0 min.)
1.13 oz. (32 g) Sterling hops (dry hop)
Wyeast 3711 (French Saison) or East Coast Yeast ECY08 (Saison Brasserie) yeast
Wyeast 3763 (Roeselare Blend) yeast and bacteria
5.8 oz. (164 g) table sugar (for priming)

Step by Step
Mash at 145 °F (63 °C) for 90 minutes. Boil for 90 minutes adding hops as indicated. Start fermentation at 70 °F (21 °C) with both the saison yeast and the Roeselare blend, allow to rise into the mid-80s °F (28–29 °C). Rack to secondary when primary fermentation is complete and dry hop for a week. Allow the gravity to stabilize before bottling, aim for 3.0 volumes of carbonation.

Extract Equivalent
Replace the Pilsner malt and flaked wheat with 3.0 lbs. (1.4 kg) of Pilsner dried malt extract, 0.75 lb. (0.34 kg) of wheat dried malt extract, and 0.50 lbs. (0.23 kg) of table sugar.

Timothy Taylor Brewery: Landlord clone
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.043 FG = 1.010
IBU = 34 SRM = 6 ABV = 4.1%

Ingredients
8.75 lbs. (4 kg) Golden Promise malt
6.75 AAU UK Fuggle hops (60 min.) (1.5 oz./43 g at 4.5% alpha acids)
4.1 AAU UK Golding hops (10 min.) (0.75 oz./21 g at 5.5% alpha acids)
1 oz. (28 g) Styrian Golding hops (0 min.)
Wyeast 1469 (West Yorkshire Ale) or White Labs WLP037 (Yorkshire Square Ale) or Lallemand Windsor Ale yeast
3/4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
On brew day, prepare your ingredients; mill the grains, measure your hops, and prepare your water. This recipe uses reverse osmosis (RO) water. Add 1/4 tsp 10% phosphoric acid per 5 gallons (19 L) of brewing water, or until water measures pH 5.5 at room temperature. Add 1 tsp. calcium chloride (CaCl2) to the mash. On brew day, mash in the Golden Promise at 152 °F (67 °C) in 13 qts. (12 L) of water, and hold this temperature for 60 minutes. Raise the temperature by infusion or direct heating to 168 °F (76 °C) to mashout. Recirculate for 15 minutes. Fly sparge with 168 °F (76 °C) water until 7 gallons (26.5 L) of wort is collected. Add 1/2 tsp. of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) to the kettle. Boil the wort very hard for 70 minutes, adding the hops at times indicated in the recipe. After adding the flameout hops, allow the hops to rest in the kettle for 40 minutes as the wort cools naturally. Chill to 66 °F (19 °C) and rack to the fermenter. Oxygenate, then pitch the yeast. Ferment at 68 °F (20 °C) until complete. Rack the beer, prime and bottle condition, or keg and force carbonate.

Extract only option:
Substitute the Golden Promise malt in the all-grain recipe with 6 lbs. (2.7 kg) Maris Otter liquid malt extract. Stir the malt extract into 6 gallons (23 L) of water at 158 °F (70 °C). Stir thoroughly to dissolve, and then bring to a boil. Follow the remaining portion of the all-grain recipe.

Ingredients
8.5 lbs. (3.86 kg) pale ale malt
1.25 lbs. (0.57 kg) Munich malt
1.25 lbs. (0.57 kg) torrified wheat
0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) crystal 300 malt (115 °L)
2.8 AAU Cascade hops (60 min.) (0.35 oz./10 g at 8% alpha acids)
16 AAU Cascade hops (0 min.) (2 oz./57 g at 8% alpha acids)
1 oz. (28 g) Bramling Cross hops (dry hop)
2 oz. (57 g) El Dorado® hops (dry hop)
Wyeast 1275 (Thames Valley) or White Labs WLP023 (Burton Ale) or SafAle S-04 yeast
1/2 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Mill the grains, then mix with 3.6 gallons (13.6 L) of 166 °F (74 °C) strike water to achieve a single infusion rest temperature of 151 °F (66 °C). Hold at this temperature for 60 minutes. Vorlauf until your runnings are clear before directing them to your boil kettle. Batch or fly sparge the mash to obtain 6.5 gallons (25 L) of wort in the kettle. If fly sparing, stop once your running’s SG hits 1.012 and top off to the desired pre-boil volume with water. Boil for 60 minutes, adding hops at the times indicated above left in the boil. At 15 minutes left in boil add either Irish moss, Whirlfloc, or other kettle fining agent of your choice.

After the boil, add flame-out hops and whirlpool for 15 minutes before rapidly chilling the wort to slightly below fermentation temperature, which is 70 °F (21 °C) for this beer. Pitch yeast and aerate well.

Maintain fermentation temperature to avoid producing too many esters, which can easily occur with this strain. Once primary fermentation is done, drop the temperature to 61 °F (16 °C). Add the dry hops and let them extract for 5 days. Bottle or keg the beer and carbonate to approximately 2.0 volumes.

Step by Step
Mash in with 15.4 qts. (14.5 L) of water to achieve a mash temperature of 150 °F (66 °C). Add phosphoric acid to adjust pH to 5.2–5.3. Hold for at least 30 minutes or until fully converted. Raise temperature to 168 °F (76 °C) for mash out. Vorlauf until runnings are clear. Collect wort; sparge until reaching 6 gallons (23 L) in the kettle.

Boil for 60 minutes with the above hop additions. Add hot water (while wort is still at or near-boiling temperatures) to adjust gravity to 1.060, then whirlpool for 20 minutes. Rapidly cool the wort to 65 °F (18 °C). Thoroughly oxygenate wort if using a liquid yeast strain, then pitch yeast. Ferment at 65–66 °F (18–19 °C). Once primary fermentation has slowed significantly, add dry hops. Four days after dry hopping, crash temperature to 35 °F (2 °C), but only when confident fermentation is complete. Carbonate to 2.6 volumes.

(5 gallons/19 L, partial mash)
OG = 1.060 FG = 1.014
IBU = 50+ SRM = 8 ABV = 6.2%

Ingredients
5.88 lbs. (2.67 kg) Briess CBW® Pale Ale dried malt extract
10 oz. (284 g) Munich malt (10 °L)
7 oz. (198 g) biscuit malt (35 °L)
4 oz. (113 g) CaraMunich® Type 3 malt (60 °L)
Follow hop schedule & yeast options from all-grain recipe

Step by Step
Mash in with 2 gallons (7.6 L) of water to achieve a mash temperature of 150 °F (65.6 °C). Place the crushed malts in a muslin bag and mash for at least 45 minutes or until fully starch is fully converted.
Once mashing is complete, remove grain bag and let the liquid drip out without squeezing the grains.

Raise the temperature to near boiling. Remove pot from heat source and add half of the total malt extract slowly, stirring constantly. Bring to a boil. Boil for 60 minutes with the indicated hop additions. Taking the pot temporarily off the heat source, stir in the remaining malt extract very slowly with 5–10 minutes left in the boil, then return to heat source. Meanwhile, pre-boil 3.5 gallons (13.3 L) of water, and chill it as close to 65 °F (18 °C), to later top up your wort.

When boil is complete, whirlpool for 20 minutes. Rapidly cool the wort to 65 °F (18 °C). Top up the wort by adding the pre-boiled water. Thoroughly oxygenate wort if using a liquid strain, then pitch yeast. Ferment at 65–66 °F (18–19 °C). Once primary fermentation has nearly ceased, add dry hops (on or shortly after day 7). Four days after dry hopping, crash temperature to 35 °F (2 °C), but only when confident fermentation is complete. Carbonate to 2.6 volumes.

Tips For Success:
Don’t get stressed out if your brewing program comes up with wildly different IBU calculations. When there are this many hop additions, variance is bound to happen. Following Titletown Brewing Company’s recipe will produce a very aromatic and flavorful hop character in your beer, with only a moderate level of bitterness. Of course, if the alpha acid numbers on your hops are much different than those listed, adjust your quantities accordingly. The key to a successful brew is ensuring your hops are as fresh as possible and from a trusted source.

To Better Times (Farmhouse Table Beer)
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.035 FG = 1.007
IBU = 10 SRM = 3 ABV = 3.7%

This recipe was created with one purpose in mind — to make a refreshing, tasty beer out of very little. The hops used are an illustration, but really any will do — the first time I made it, I just used a handful of wild hops.

Ingredients
2.5 lbs. (1.13 kg) 2-row pale ale malt
2.5 lbs. (1.13 kg) Pilsner malt
1.9 lbs. (860 g) rolled oats/oatmeal
10 oz. (283 g) dried bread (made from about 1 lb./0.45 kg fresh bread)
3.3 AAU East Kent Golding hops (30 min.) (0.6 oz./17 g at 5.7% alpha acids)
25–30 bay leaves (30 min.)
Omega Yeast Labs OYL-033 (Jovaru Lithuanian Farmhouse), Lallemand Belle Saison, or bread yeast
3⁄4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by step
Before brewing, dry the bread in the oven at 195 °F (90 °C), turning occasionally, for an hour or until completely dry, then break into small chunks. Mash all the grains and bread at around 149 °F (65 °C) for one hour. Collect 5.5 gallons (21 L) of wort in the kettle and boil for 30 minutes, adding the hops and bay leaves as soon as the boil begins.

At the end of the boil, remove the hops and bay leaves, then chill the wort to around 86 °F (30 °C) and aerate well before pitching the yeast. Ferment at 86 °F (30 °C) for five days, then chill to around 39 °F (4 °C), if possible, for two days. Rack to keg or bottles and either prime with the sugar or keg and force carbonate to around 2.0–2.5 volumes.

Ingredients
9.5 lbs. (4.3 kg) Muntons pale ale malt (5.5 °L)
0.2 lb. (0.9 kg) Muntons chocolate malt (380 °L)
0.8 lb. (0.36 kg) Dingemans Special B malt (100 °L)
0.9 lb. (0.4 kg) Muntons light crystal malt (56 °L)
0.8 lb. (0.36 kg) Hugh Baird Carastan malt (15 °L)
7.11 AAU Magnum hops (bittering) (0.55 oz./16 g of 13% alpha acid)
0.5 oz. (14 g) Santiam hops (flavor)
0.5 oz. (14 g) Glacier hops (flavor)
White Labs WLP051 (California Ale V), Wyeast 1098 (Whitbread British) or White Labs WLP002 (English Ale) yeast
1 cup light dried malt extract (for priming)

Step by Step
Assuming a milled dry grain temperature of 68 °F (20 °C) and a desired liquor-to-grist ratio of 3:1 by weight, heat about 4.25 gallons (16 L) of water to a temperature of roughly 166 °F (74 °C). Infuse the mash with this liquor until you reach the mash target temperature of 155 °F (68 °C). Hold that temperature for about 45 minutes for proper grain hydration and enzymatic conversion. Meanwhile, heat plenty of sparge water to a temperature of 175 °F (79 °C), which should be sufficient to raise the grain bed temperature during the sparge to the mash-out temperature of 167 °F (75 °C). Recirculate the initial runnings until the wort runs clear. Sparge very slowly for about 45 minutes until the kettle gravity is about 1.050 (12.4 °P).

Boil the wort for 75 minutes. Add the bittering hops 15 minutes into the boil and the flavor hops 55 minutes into the boil. After shut-down, take a gravity reading. If necessary, liquor the wort down to the target OG of 1.058 (14.26 °P).

Then add the aroma hops and whirlpool for about half an hour. Heat-exchange the wort to about 70 ºF (21 °C), pitch the yeast, and aerate thoroughly. Primary fermentation should last about a week. Allow the lees to settle for two days after primary fermentation and rack the brew into a clean container. Let the brew mature without pressure for another two or three weeks. Rack again and add the priming agent. Now bottle or keep in a closed Cornelius keg for conditioning. Omit the priming agent, if you use bottled CO2 and a keg. After a week, the porter should be ready for serving.

Step by Step
Mill or coarsely crack the specialty malts. Mix them well and apportion them into two muslin bags. Steep the bags in about 1 gallon (~4 liters) of water at roughly 170 ºF (77 °C). Hydrate the grain for about an hour, while periodically giving the steeping pot a boost of heat to maintain the proper temperature. Lift each bag separately out of the steeping liquid and rinse it with 2 cups of cold water.

Allow the bags to drip dry. Do not squeeze them. Add about 3 gallons (11.4 L) of brewing liquor to the steeping liquor and bring to a boil. Turn off the heat and stir in the malt extract. Bring the wort to a boil and add the bittering hops. Boil for 1 hour. Add the flavor hops 20 minutes before shut down. At shut-down, take a gravity measurement and liquor the wort down to the required original gravity of 1.058 (12.37 °P). Add the aroma hops and whirlpool for 30 minutes. Then follow the equivalent instructions for the all-grain recipe.

Traditional Cathedral Kölsch
Traditional Cathedral Kölsch
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.048 FG = 1.012
SRM = 2.8 IBU = 25 ABV = 4.7%

Ingredients
8.7 lbs. (3.9 kg) Pils malt (< 2 °L)
1.3 lbs. (0.59 kg) wheat malt (2 °L)
5.5 AAU Tettnanger (60 min.) (1.35 oz./38 g of 4.1% alpha acid)
1 oz. (28 g) Tettnanger hops (10 min.)
1 tsp. Irish moss
White Labs WLP029 (Kölsch) or Wyeast 2565 (Kölsch) yeast
3/4 cup DME or corn sugar

Step by Step
If you want to be true to style, start with as thick a mash as you can, at roughly 110 °F (43 °C). Increase the mash temperature gradually by about 1 °F (1/2 °C) per minute by infusing it very slowly with near-boiling water. To avoid excessive hot spots, keep stirring the mash gently while you are raising the temperature. Once the mash reaches about 146 °F (66 °C), stop for a 30-minute rest, which favors the formation of easily fermentable maltose. Then employ the next saccarification rest, for about 15 minutes, in the upper 150 °F range (around 70 °C). Then ramp the temperature up to sightly below 170 °F (roughy 78 °C). It is OK to thin out the mash at this point. Some German breweries have as much as 80% of their net kettle volume in water in the mash tun before they start the sparge. During the sparge, check the mash temperature periodically, and make sure it remains steady. The sparge for a Kölsch may be relatively fast. Do not continue sparging when the run-off drops below a gravity of 1.010.

Boil the Kölsch for about 70 minutes. Add the bittering hops about 10 minutes into the boil and the flavor hops, as well as the Irish moss, about 10 minutes before shut-down. You can get by with only two additions of German noble hops. If your palate craves a smidgen more aroma, however, you can add an extra half-ounce of hops exactly at shutdown.

Cool the wort to the proper temperature and pitch a true Kölsch-style, top-fermenting yeast. The White Labs WLP029 (Kölsch) prefers a temperature of 65-69 °F (18–21 °C) and really does not like a temperature below 62 °F (17 °C). The Wyeast 2565 (Kölsch), on the other hand, is happiest at what is more of an altbier temperature of 56–64 °F (13–18 °C). Select the White Labs yeast if you like a fruitier Kölsch; select the Wyeast yeast if you prefer a cleaner, crisper taste. Wait for about two weeks until final gravity settles in. Now rack your brew off its lees and put it into your lagering fridge (or cool basement). When the beer is done, rack it again and prime with dried malt extract or corn sugar and bottle the beer. Making Kölsch is that simple!

Traditional Cathedral Kölsch
(5 gallons/19 L, partial mash)
OG = 1.048 FG = 1.012
SRM = 2.8 IBU = 25 ABV = 4.7%

Ingredients
5.75 lbs. (2.6 kg) German-style light malt extract (such as Weyermann or Bierkeller)
1.3 lbs. (0.59 kg) wheat malt ( 2 °L)
5.5 AAU Tettnanger (60 min.) (1.35 oz./38 oz. of 4.1% alpha acid)
1 oz. (28 g) Tettnanger hops (10 min.)
1 tsp. Irish moss
White Labs WLP029 (Kölsch) or Wyeast 2565 (Kölsch) yeast
3/4 cup DME or corn sugar

Step by Step
Coarsely mill the wheat, place it into a muslin bag and put the bag into cold water. Heat the water for about 30 minutes to 170–190 °F (77–88 °C). Do not boil the liquid! Lift the bag out of the pot and rinse it with several cups of cold water. Do not squeeze the bag! Add your "wheat water" to your kettle liquor and bring it to a boil. Turn off the heat when you stir in the extract. Stir and bring to a boil. From then on, follow the all-grain instructions to finish the beer.

IBU = 25 SRM = 13 ABV = 7.7%

This recipe calls for a triple decoction mash and a 90 minute boil. Be prepared for a long brewday, but the reward at the end will be well worth the extra efforts.

Ingredients
8 lbs. (3.6 kg) German Pilsner malt
2 lbs. (0.91 kg) Pilsner malt, toasted (see step-by-step)
5 lbs. (2.3 kg) German Munich dark malt (9 °L)
1 oz. Hallertau Tradition hops (60 min.) (1 oz./28 g at 5.8% alpha acids)
2.9 AAU Hallertau Tradition hops (20 min.) (0.25 oz./7 g at 5.8% alpha acids)
1.9 AAU Tettnanger hops (20 min.) (0.25 oz./7 g at 3.8% alpha acids)
Wyeast 2206 (Bavarian Lager) or White Labs WLP820 (Oktoberfest/Märzen Lager) or Mangrove Jack's M76 (Bavarian Lager) yeast
3/4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step By Step
About one week prior to brewday toast the 2 lbs. (0.91 kg) of Pilsner malt in the oven at in 350 °F (177 °C) oven for 15 minutes. Two days prior to brewday, make an appropriate sized starter if using the liquid yeast strain. Use 2 sachets if using dried yeast.

Add approximately 22.5 qts. (21.3 L) of water at 99 °F (37 °C) to hit the first strike temperature of 95 °F (35 °C). Hold for 15 minutes. At the end of this time, draw off about 40 percent of the mash into a separate pot, leaving as much liquid behind as possible. Maintain the temperature of this rest mash during the decoction.

First Decoction: Raise the temperature slowly, about 5 °F (3 °C) per minute, to 155 °F (68 °C). Hold for ten minutes, then raise the temperature quickly to boiling. Boil for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally to avoid scorching. Then transfer the boiled mash to the rest mash two cups at a time, until the rest mash is at the next strike temperature, 122 °F (50 °C). Set any remaining decocted mash aside until it cools to 122 °F (50 °C), then stir it into the mash. Let the mash rest for 15 minutes, then proceed to the second decoction.

Second Decoction: Again draw off about 40 percent of the mash, leaving behind as much liquid as possible. Raise the temperature 5 °F (3 °C) per minute, to 155 °F (68 °C), hold for ten minutes, then raise the temperature quickly to boiling. Boil for 30 minutes. Transfer the boiled mash to the rest mash two cups at a time until the rest mash is at the next strike temperature, 155 °F (68 °C). Set any remaining decocted mash aside until it cools to 155 °F (68 °C), then stir it into the mash. Let rest for 15 minutes, then proceed to the third decoction.

Third Decoction: In this decoction instead of boiling the thick part of the mash, we’ll be boiling the liquid part of the mash. Draw off 40-50 percent of the liquid and bring it quickly to a boil. Hold for at least 30 minutes.

Test the rest mash for conversion with iodine as described above, then add the decocted liquid back to the rest mash until the mash-out temperature of 170 °F (77 °C) is reached. Set any remaining liquid aside until it cools to 170 °F (77 °C), then stir it back into the mash. There are two reasons we’re boiling the liquid at this point:

That’s where the sugars reside now, so boiling the high-gravity liquid will contribute greatly to maltiness and color by caramelizing some of the sugars in the liquid.
Since we’re no longer concerned with preserving the amylase enzymes now that conversion is complete, it’s to our advantage to disable them. That way the dextrins in the mash, which contribute to body and head retention, aren’t further converted into fermentable sugars, resulting in a thin beer.
Let the mash rest at the mash-out temperature for 10 minutes, then transfer to the lauter tun if a combination mash/lauter tun isn’t being used. In either case thoroughly stir the mash so the heavier husks settle out and form a well-stratified filter bed.

Proceed with the sparge, stopping when you’ve collected 7 gallons (26.5 L) of wort. Boil the wort for a total of 90 minutes, adding hops per the schedule indicated. Reserve two quarts of wort for later use in priming the beer.

Chill the remaining wort to about 60 °F (16 °C) and pitch the yeast. Transfer the fermenter to a 50 °F (10 °C) refrigerator for three to four hours after pitching and ferment for seven to 10 days, then transfer to a secondary fermenter.

When the beer is clear (three to five weeks), rack to the bottling bucket into which the reserved priming wort has been poured. Bottle as usual.

Traditional Pumpkin Ale
Traditional Pumpkin Ale
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.054 FG = 1.014
IBU = 15 SRM = 14 ABV = 5.4%

This is my traditional amber spiced pumpkin ale recipe, a classic example of what would come to mind if you ordered a pumpkin beer a decade ago.

Ingredients
4 lbs. (1.8 kg) pale ale malt
2 lbs. (0.9 kg) Vienna malt
1.5 lbs. (0.68 kg) dark Munich malt
12 oz. (340 g) flaked oats
12 oz. (340 g) flaked wheat
12 oz. (340 g) caramel malt (20 °L)
6 oz. (170 g) brown malt
2 oz. (57 g) chocolate malt
8 oz. (227 g) brown sugar
3 oz. (85 g) light molasses
9 lbs. (4.1 kg) canned pumpkin puree (plain, unspiced)
6 cinnamon sticks, broken up
1.5 Tbsp. crystalized ginger, chopped
1 whole nutmeg, chopped
10 dried allspice berries, crushed
0.25 tsp. ground mace
4.1 AAU UK Goldings hops (60 min.) (0.7 oz./20 g at 5.9% alpha acids)
Wyeast 1272 (American Ale II), White Labs WLP051 (California Ale V), or Mangrove Jack’s M36 (Liberty Bell Ale) yeast
3⁄4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Prepare the pumpkin (can be done the night before brewing) by removing from cans and putting into a large baking dish. Roast in a 400 °F (204 °C) oven for about one hour, stirring every 15 minutes, until fairly dry and caramelized but not burned. Put in a fine mesh bag. If prepared the night before, allow to cool, cover, and refrigerate until brew day. Remove from refrigerator and allow to come to room temperature before using.

Prepare spices (can be done during the mash or boil). Place spices in a fine mesh bag (a hop bag works nicely).

This recipe uses reverse osmosis (RO) water. Adjust all brewing water to a pH of 5.5 using phosphoric acid. Add 1 tsp. of calcium chloride to the mash.

Step mash: Mash in first five grains at 131 °F (55 °C) using a 1.5 qts./lb. water-to-grist ratio (3.1 L/kg). Hold for 15 minutes. Raise to 149 °F (65 °C) and rest for 30 minutes. Raise to 158 °F (70 °C) and rest for 30 minutes. Finally, raise to 168 °F (76 °C) to mashout. Add the pumpkin in the mesh bag, and the caramel, brown, and chocolate malts, and recirculate for 15 minutes, recirculating over the top and through the mesh bag.

Sparge slowly and collect 6.5 gallons (24.5 L) of wort. If lautering is difficult, adding a pound (0.45 kg) of rice hulls can help.

After the wort has been collected, add the mesh bag of pumpkin to the kettle. Leave it in the kettle as it comes to a boil. Remove the bag when the wort has come to a boil, allowing liquid to drip back into the kettle.

Boil the wort for 90 minutes, adding hops at the time indicated in the recipe. The sugar and molasses are added with 15 minutes left in the boil. Put the spices in a tight mesh bag and add when boil is complete, stirring; remove after 10 minutes. Run off from the kettle slowly, preferably filtering through the spent hops.

Chill the wort to 66 °F (19 °C), pitch the yeast, and ferment until complete.

Rack the beer, allowing the beer to drop bright, using crash cooling or fining if necessary. Adjust spices to taste, if desired. Prime and bottle condition, or keg and force carbonate.

3⁄4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Prepare the pumpkin (can be done the night before brewing) by removing from cans and putting into a large baking dish. Roast in a 400 °F (204 °C) oven for about one hour, stirring every 15 minutes, until fairly dry and caramelized but not burned. Put in a fine mesh bag. If prepared the night before, allow to cool, cover, and refrigerate until brew day. Remove from refrigerator and allow to come to room temperature before using.

Prepare spices and place them in a fine mesh bag.

Use 6 gallons (23 L) of water in the brew kettle; heat to 158 °F (70 °C). Place the pumpkin (still in the mesh bag), and the caramel, brown, and chocolate malts in another mesh bag, and steep in the hot water for 30 minutes. Remove the mesh bags, then turn the heat off.

Add the liquid malt extract and stir thoroughly to dissolve the extract completely. You do not want to feel liquid extract at the bottom of the kettle when stirring with your spoon. Put the pumpkin mesh bag back in, turn the heat back on and bring to a boil. Once a boil is reached, remove the pumpkin, allowing liquid to drip back into the kettle. Boil the wort for 60 minutes, adding the hops at the time indicated in the recipe. Add the sugar and molasses with 15 minutes left in the boil.

Follow the remainder of the all-grain recipe.

Bamberg Rauchbier
Bamberg Rauchbier
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.054 FG = 1.013
IBU = 30 SRM = 18 ABV = 5.3%

Ingredients
4.0 lbs. (1.8 kg) Pils malt (<2° L)
2.0 lbs. (0.91 kg) Munich malt (10° L)
3.0 lbs. (1.4 kg) Weyermann smoked malt (2–3.5° L)
0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) dextrin malt
0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) Vienna malt (2–3.5° L)
1.0 lb. (0.45 kg) Weyermann Caramunich® II (~45° L)
3 oz. Weyermann Carafa® Special III (450–488° L)
6.7 AAU German noble hops, such as Hallertauer or Tettnanger (75 min.) (1.5 oz./43 g of 4.5% alpha acid)
0.75 oz. (21 g) German noble hops, such as Hallertauer or Tettnanger (30 min.)
0.75 oz. (21 g) German noble hops, such as Hallertauer or Tettnanger (15 min.)
2 packages of Wyeast 2206 (Bavarian Lager) or White Labs WLP830 (German Lager)
1 cup DME or corn sugar (for bottling)

Step by Step
Rauchbier-mashing involves several rests. To imitate the original Bamberg method, dough in at a cool 113 °F (45 °C) and keep the temperature at that level for about 30 minutes. Next, infuse the mash slowly with very hot water, while stirring gently, to raise the temperature by about 2 °F (1 °C) per minute to 149 °F (66 °C) for another 30-minute rest. At 149 °F (66 °C), beta amylase enzymes are at their peak performance, while alpha amylase have become active as well (they start at 140 °F/60 °C).

The optimum target pH value for a rauchbier mash is around 5.0. Infuse the mash again with hot water to reach 162 °F (72 °C) for yet another 30-minute rest. At this temperature, alpha amylase reach their peak performance. Finally infuse the mash to reach 170 °F (77 °C). This is the temperature you should maintain for the duration of a 90-minute sparge.

Boil time for the wort is at least 90 minutes, but two hours is better, because a longer boil promotes wort browning from melanoidins. Add the bittering hops about 15 minutes into the boil, the flavor hops about 30 minutes before shut-down, and the aroma hops about 15 minutes before shut-down. Check the gravity at the end of the boil and compensate for evaporation losses by adding cold water to the fermenter.

Heat-exchange the wort to roughly 55 °F (13 °C) and aerate. Primary fermentation lasts about seven days, at which point there should be a gravity drop of about 90% of the difference between OG and FG. Rack the brew, and start reducing the brew’s temperature by about 2 °F (1 °C) per day to as close to 28 °F (-2 °C) as your equipment allows. Lager the brew at this temperature undisturbed for six to eight weeks. Then rack, prime and bottle. The rauchbier is ready for drinking after about another week. Serve the beer at around 45 °F (7 °C).

Traditional Umqombothi
Traditional Umqombothi
(~2.5 gallons/10 L, all-grain)
ABV = ~2.5%

Recipes for umqombothi vary wildly. Some use double the amount of sorghum-to-maize, others use more maize than sorghum. Some start with a vast amount of liquid while others add the liquid in stages as the days progress. This recipe is based on one given to me by Nolu but with a few of my own tweaks that came about when I wasn’t sure what to do next and couldn’t get hold of my mentor. The recipe (with some added passion fruit) went on to win the homebrewing competition, which was judged by drinkers that were extremely familiar with the style.

Ingredients
8.8 lbs. (4 kg) malted sorghum
4.4 lbs. (2 kg) maize meal

Step by Step

Day one
Pour 2 gallons (8 L) of boiling water into a sanitized bucket, then add all of the maize meal and 4.4 lbs. (2 kg) of the malted sorghum to the water. Stir well to ensure there are no dough balls. Place a lid on the bucket for 10 minutes. After 10 minutes, add 1 gallon (4 L) of water. Mix again, then cover with cheesecloth or a tea towel and leave to cool overnight.
﻿

Day two
You should see lots of small bubbles rising to the surface of the mash. If you can’t, leave it for a few more hours. You will also note a decidedly sour aroma.

In a large pot, boil 1 gallon (4 L) of water. Once it reaches boiling point, add your sour mash, stirring constantly. Cook for one hour. Timing isn’t as important as you might be used to and you can start the timer from the moment the pot hits the stove — no need to wait until it reaches a boil. The mixture will darken as it cooks.

Stir occasionally to help stop it from sticking to the bottom of the pan, although some scorched grain is inevitable and an acceptable part of the process. After about an hour, return the mixture to your bucket and again leave it to cool overnight. You will find that the mixture is very thick, with little liquid.
﻿

Day three
Add the remaining 4.4 lbs. (2 kg) of malted sorghum to the cooled porridge. The mixture will be incredibly thick, with a consistency of mashed potatoes. Add a further 2 quarts (2 L) of cold water and stir. You want the mixture to reach a consistency of runny oatmeal. You might have to add up to 3 gallons (12 L) of extra water, depending on how much the porridge gelatinized during the boil.

Cover and leave in a warm place to ferment overnight.
﻿

Day four
You should see plenty of fermentation action, with bubbles rising to the surface throughout the day. If you have visible fermentation, you can strain the mixture and leave the wort to continue fermenting overnight. If fermentation is slow, leave it for another day, pushing the rest of the process back a day.
﻿

Day five
If you have strained your mixture, you should see a healthy kräusen atop your liquid, made up of large, cream-colored bubbles. This indicates that it is time to serve. Umqombothi is served uncarbonated and usually unchilled.

1⁄2 whirlﬂoc tablet (5 min.)
Safale US-05 yeast
White Labs WLP500 (Trappist Ale) yeast
1 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step

Mash grains at 152 °F (67 °C) for 45 minutes in 15 qts. (14 L) of water. Boil wort for 60 minutes, adding your first hop addition at the beginning of the boil. Add second hop addition and sugar with 15 minutes left in the boil and whirlfloc with 5 minutes remaining. Cool wort below 70 °F (21 °C) and pitch dried yeast. After signs of active fermentation are present, approximately 12–24 hours, pitch the Belgian yeast. After primary fermentation is complete, add dry hops to secondary and allow 4 to 14 days before bottling. For a higher carbonation level, use 13⁄4 cups of corn sugar when using thicker Champagne-style bottles or other bottles that are rated for high pressure.

Ingredients

4 lbs. (1.8 kg) Pilsen liquid malt extract.
1.25 lbs. (0.57 kg) light dried malt extract
1.5 lbs. (0.68 kg) 2-row pale malt
8 oz. (0.23 kg) wheat malt
8 oz. (0.23 kg) flaked wheat
8 oz. (0.23 kg) Vienna malt

1⁄2 whirlﬂoc tablet (5 min.)
Safale US-05 yeast
White Labs WLP500 (Trappist Ale) yeast
1 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step

If you can find a malt extract made from Belgian pale or Pilsner malt, use that, otherwise use English malt extract. You will need a 2-gallon (7.6-L) beverage cooler and a large steeping bag to follow these instructions. Add crushed grains and flaked wheat to grain bag. Add 5.5 qts. (5.2 L) of 163 °F (73 °C) water to cooler and submerge bag. Mash for 45 minutes at 152 °F (67 °C). Heat 5.5 qts. (5.2 L) of water to 180 °F (82 °C) near end of mash. Run off wort by collecting about 2 cups of wort from the cooler, then adding the same volume of hot water to the top of the grain bed. Repeat until you collect about 2.5 gallons (9.5 L) of wort this way. (Don’t let the grain bed temperature rise above 170 °F/77 °C.) Stir in dried malt extract and bring wort to a boil.

Boil wort for 60 minutes, adding your first hop addition at the beginning of the boil. Add second hop addition and sugar with 15 minutes left in the boil and whirl-floc with 5 minutes remaining. Cool wort and transfer to fermenter. Top up to 5 gallons (19 L), aerate and pitch dried yeast. Pitch Belgian yeast once fermentation starts. Dry hop for 4 to 14 days. For a higher carbonation level, use 13⁄4 cups of cornnsugar when using thicker Champagne-style bottles or other bottles that are rated for high pressure.

Tips for Success:
For a "cleaner" beer, hold the fermentation temperature steady around 68–70 °F (20–21 °C). For a beer with more "Belgian-y" esters, let the fermentation climb after the first couple days to the mid 70s °F (~24 °C).

Belgian Dubbel
Belgian Dubbel
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.070 FG = 1.012
IBU = 20 SRM = 15 ABV = 7.5%

We decided on a simple grain bill for our dubbel to allow the yeast to express that Belgian character of fruity esters and some spicy phenols in the aroma that so many of us enjoy when we first take a sip of a well-made dubbel.

Ingredients
10 lbs. (4.5 kg) Belgian Pilsner malt
3 lbs. (1.4 kg) Dingeman’s pale malt
7 oz. (0.2 kg) Belgian caramel Munich malt (56 °L)
1 lb. (0.45 kg) Belgian candi syrup D-90 (near end of fermentation)
4.8 AAU Hallertauer hops (60 min.) (1 oz./28 g at 4.8% alpha acids)
2.4 AAU Hallertauer hops (20 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 4.8% alpha acids)
Wyeast 3787 (Trappist Style High Gravity) or White Labs WLP530 (Abbey Ale) or Lallemand Abbaye or Safbrew BE-256 yeast
3⁄4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
This is a multi-step mash. Mill the grains, then mix with 5.1 gallons (19.4 L) of 154 °F (72 °C) strike water to reach a mash temperature of 144 °F (66 °C). Hold this temperature for 30 minutes. Raise the mash temperature through infusion of boiling water or recirculating system up to 158 °F (70°C). Hold this temperature for 30 minutes. Raise the mash temperature to mash out at 172 °F (78 °C). Vorlauf until your runnings are clear, then begin sparge. Sparge the grains with enough water to obtain 7 gallons (26.5 L) of wort.

Boil for 90 minutes, adding hops according to the ingredient list. After the boil, whirlpool the hot wort for 5 minutes, then let settle for 5 minutes. Chill the wort to about 65 °F (18 °C) and then pitch yeast and aerate wort.

Once fermentation commences, allow beer to free rise up to 70 °F (21 °C). You can hold this temperature for ten days or until the completion of primary fermentation, whichever is later. Add the candi syrup once fermentation begins to slow down. Bottle or keg the beer and carbonate to approximately 2.5 volumes.

Wyeast 3787 (Trappist Style High Gravity) or White Labs WLP530 (Abbey Ale) or Lallemand Abbaye or Safbrew BE-256 yeast
3⁄4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step

Bring 5 gallons (19 L) of water to approximately 165 °F (74 °C) and hold there, steeping the specialty malts in grain bags for 15 minutes. Remove the grain bags and let drain fully. Add the malt extracts while stirring, and stir until completely dissolved.

Boil for 60 minutes, adding hops according to the ingredient list. After the boil, whirlpool the hot wort for 5 minutes, then let settle for 5 minutes. Chill the wort to about 65 °F (18 °C), top off to 5.25 gallons (20 L) and then pitch yeast and aerate wort.

Once fermentation commences, allow beer to free rise up to 70 °F (21 °C). You can hold this temperature for ten days or until the completion of primary fermentation, whichever is later. Add the candi syrup once fermentation begins to slow down. Bottle or keg the beer and carbonate to approximately 2.5 volumes.

Tips for success:

If you are unable to get Belgian Pilsner malt you can use a German or Czech Pilsner malt, but we both feel there is a slight difference with the Belgian Pilsner malt that warrants its use.

Belgian Tripel
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.082 FG = 1.013
IBU = 32 SRM = 6 ABV = 8.9%

This tripel has a standard grain bill and a process like our Belgian dubbel with one twist —the addition of Weyermann Abbey malt. The Abbey malt gives the finished tripel more malt character that the best commercial examples in Belgium all have.

Ingredients
15.75 lbs. (7.2 kg) Pilsner malt
7 oz. (0.2 kg) Weyermann Abbey Malt® (26 °L)
1 lb. (0.45 kg) Belgian candi syrup (1 °L) (near end of fermentation)
8.3 AAU Premiant hops (60 min.) (1.1 oz./31 g at 7.5% alpha acids)
2.6 AAU Saaz hops (30 min.) (0.7 oz./20 g at 3.75% alpha acids)
Wyeast 3787 (Trappist Style High Gravity) or White Labs WLP530 (Abbey Ale) or Lallemand Abbaye or Safbrew BE-256 yeast
3⁄4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
This is a multi-step mash. Mill the grains, then mix with 6.1 gallons (23 L) of 154 °F (72 °C) strike water to reach a mash temperature of 144 °F (66 °C). Hold this temperature for 30 minutes. Raise the mash temperature through infusion of boiling water or recirculating system up to 158 °F (70°C). Hold this temperature for 30 minutes. Raise the mash to mash out at 172 °F (78 °C). Vorlauf until your runnings are clear, then begin sparge. Sparge the grains with enough water to obtain 7 gallons (26.5 L) of wort.

Boil for 90 minutes, adding hops according to the ingredient list. After the boil, whirlpool for 5 minutes, then let settle for 5 minutes. Chill the wort to about 65 °F (18 °C) and then pitch yeast and aerate wort.

Once fermentation commences, allow beer to free rise up to 70 °F (21 °C). You can hold this temperature for ten days or until the completion of primary fermentation, whichever is later. Add the candi syrup once fermentation begins to slow down. Bottle or keg the beer and carbonate to approximately 2.8 volumes.

Step by Step
This recipe is designed for homebrewers to achieve 5.5 gallons (21 L) wort in their fermenter on brew day. This will help offset the loss of volume to the heavy hopping rate of this beer. Build your water profile to achieve a 100:200 PPM sulfate: chloride profile. Crush the malt and add to 4.5 gallons (17 L) strike water to achieve a stable mash temperature at 154 °F (68 °C). After 60 minutes, begin to lauter. Collect 7 gallons (26.5 L) of wort in the kettle. Boil for 60 minutes, adding the hop extract after the wort comes to a boil and the turbinado sugar with 15 minutes left in the boil. After the boil, chill the wort down to 180 °F (82 °C) and then add the hop stand addition. Stir the wort, then let settle for 30 minutes before cooling to yeast pitching temperature. Ferment at 68 °F (20 °C). As the kräusen begins to fall, typically day 4 or 5, add the dry hops and spunding valve. Let the beer sit on the hops for 3 days. Bottle with priming sugar or keg and force carbonate to 2.4 volumes of CO2.

Extract with grains option:
Substitute the pale ale malt in the all-grain recipe with 6 lbs. (2.7 kg) extra light dried malt extract. Place the crushed malt in a muslin bag. Steep the grains in 1 gallon (4 L) water at 154 °F (68 °C) for 45 minutes. Remove the grain bag and wash with 2 qts. (2 L) hot water. Top off the kettle to 6.5 gallons (25 L), stir in the dried malt extract and heat up to boil. Follow the remaining portion of the all-grain recipe.

(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.096 FG = 1.021
IBU = 106 SRM = 11 ABV = 10.7%

Ingredients
18 lbs. (8.17 kg) Maris Otter pale ale malt
1 lb. (0.45 kg) Carared® (20 °L)
30 AAU Centennial hops (first wort hop) (3 oz./85 g at 10% alpha acids)
30 AAU Centennial hops (5 min.) (3 oz./85 g at 10% alpha acids)
3 oz. (85 g) Centennial hops (dry hop)
1⁄2 whirfloc tablet (5 min.)
White Labs WLP001 (California Ale), Wyeast 1056 (American Ale) or Safale US-05 yeast (4.25 qt./~4.25 L yeast starter)
3⁄4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Mill the grains. Dough in using 4.5 gallons (17 L) of water with a target mash holding temperature of 148 °F (64 °C). Hold the mash temperature for approximately 60 minutes or until the conversion is complete. Raise the temperature of the mash to 168 °F (76 °C) and begin sparging with 170 °F (77 °C) water until you collect 6 gallons (23 L) of wort in the kettle. As runoff begins, add the first wort hops to the kettle.

The total wort boiling time for this recipe is 60 minutes. When there are 5 minutes remaining in the boil, be sure to add your whirfloc or other kettle fining agent to help with precipitation of the hot break. Add the second hop addition 5 minutes prior to flame out as well.

Cool the wort to 70 °F (21 °C), transfer to your fermentation vessel and aerate the wort adequately. Since this is a very high gravity beer, you will likely need to use pure oxygen to get the levels of 10–12 ppm needed to ensure a complete fermentation. It should also be noted that normal pitching rates will be inadequate. To be safe, you should pitch 2–3 times the amount of yeast you would normally pitch for a 1.050 beer. (The yeast starter size listed in the ingredients list is a compromise between the optimal amount of yeast for fermenting a beer of this gravity and the fact that overpitching can scrub some hop character.) Add the contents of your yeast starter to the chilled wort. Ferment around 70 °F (21 °C) until the final gravity is reached, which should be in 10 to 14 days. Rack to a secondary vessel and allow the beer to mature for one week around the same temperature. Then dry hop the beer for an additional week. Your beer is now ready to rack into a keg or bottles along with the priming sugar.

Ingredients
12.25 lbs. (5.55 kg) light liquid malt extract
1 lb. (0.45 kg) Carared® (20 °L)
30 AAU Centennial hops (first wort hop) (3 oz./85 g at 10% alpha acids)

Step by Step
Mill the specialty grains. Place the milled grains in a grain bag. Steep them in 2 gallons (7.6 L) of 148 °F (66 °C) water for 30 minutes. Add the first wort hops to the kettle. Rinse the grain bag with about 2 qts. (1.9 L) of water and allow it to drip into the kettle for about 15 minutes, but be sure not to squeeze the bag.

Add enough water for a pre-boil volume of 6 gallons (23 L). (If you cannot perform a full-wort boil, split your wort into two 2.5-gallons (9.5-L) batches and boil individually. Split the ingredients proportionally between batches.) Stir in the malt extracts and begin the 60-minute boil. When there are 5 minutes remaining in the boil, be sure to add your whirfloc or other kettle fining agent to help with precipitation of the hot break. Add the second hop addition 5 minutes prior to flame out as well. Cool the wort to 70 °F (21 °C), transfer to your fermentation vessel and aerate the wort adequately.

Many people expect a darker beer to be bigger and richer, even though that is not always the case. This recipe is on the bigger end of the style, with a rich caramel note.

Ingredients
6.2 lb. (2.8 kg) Great Western wheat malt (2 °L) or similar
2.6 lb. (1.2 kg) Durst or Weyermann Munich malt (8 °L) or similar
1.9 lb. (850 g) Durst or Weyermann continental Pilsner malt (1.8 °L) or similar
5.3 oz. (150 g) Dingemans Special B malt (120 °L) or similar
5.3 oz. (150 g) Briess crystal malt (40 °L) or similar
2.6 oz. (75 g) Weyermann Carafa® Special II (430 °L)
3.36 AAU Hallertau pellet hops (60 min.)(0.84 oz./24 g at 4% alpha acids)
Wyeast 3068 (Weihenstephan Weizen) or White Labs WLP300 (Hefeweizen Ale) or Lallemand Munich Classic yeast

Step by Step
Mill the grains and dough-in targeting a mash of around 1.5 quarts of water to 1 pound of grain (a liquor-to-grist ratio of about 3:1 by weight) and a temperature of 152 °F (67 °C). Hold the mash at 152 °F (67 °C) until enzymatic conversion is complete. Infuse the mash with near boiling water while stirring or with a recirculating mash system raise the temperature to mash out at 168 °F (76 °C). Sparge slowly with 170 °F (77 °C) water, collecting wort until the pre-boil kettle volume is around 6.5 gallons (24.4 L) and the gravity is 1.043 (10.8 °P).

The total wort boil time is 90 minutes, which helps reduce the SMM present in the lightly kilned Pilsner malt and results in less DMS in the finished beer. Add the bittering hops with 60 minutes remaining in the boil. I skip kettle finings in this beer. Chill the wort rapidly to 62 °F (17 °C), let the break material settle, rack to the fermenter, pitch the yeast and aerate thoroughly. The proper pitch rate is 10 grams of properly rehydrated dry yeast, two packages of liquid yeast or one package of liquid yeast in a 2-liter starter.

Ferment at 62 °F (17 °C) until the beer attenuates fully. With healthy yeast, fermentation should be complete in a week, but don't rush it. The cooler than average ale fermentation temperature can extend the time it takes for complete attenuation. Rack to a keg and force carbonate or rack to a bottling bucket, add priming sugar, and bottle. Target a carbonation level of 2.5 to 3 volumes.

OG = 1.056 (13.8 °P)
FG = 1.014 (3.5 °P)
IBU = 16 SRM = 17 ABV = 5.6%

Ingredients
5.0 lb. (2.3 kg) wheat liquid malt extract (4 °L)
2.2 lb. (1 kg) Weyermann Munich Amber liquid malt extract (8 °L)
5.3 oz. (150 g) Dingemans Special B malt (120 °L) or similar
5.3 oz. (150 g) Briess crystal malt (40 °L) or similar
2.6 oz. (75 g) Weyermann Carafa® Special II (430 °L)
3.36 AAU Hallertau pellet hops (60 min.) (0.84 oz./24 g at 4% alpha acids)
Wyeast 3068 (Weihenstephan Weizen) or White Labs WLP300 (Hefeweizen Ale) or Lallemand Munich Classic yeast

Step by Step
I have used a number of wheat and Munich malt extracts with good results. Always choose the freshest extract that fits the beer style. If you can't get fresh liquid malt extract, it is better to use an appropriate amount of dried malt extract (DME) instead.

Mill or coarsely crack the specialty malt and place loosely in a grain bag. Avoid packing the grains too tightly in the bag, using more bags if needed. Steep the bag in about 1⁄2 gallon (~2 liters) of water at roughly 170 °F (77 °C) for about 30 minutes. Lift the grain bag out of the steeping liquid and rinse with warm water. Allow the bags to drip into the kettle for a few minutes while you add the malt extract. Do not squeeze the bags. Add enough water to the steeping liquor and malt extract to make a pre-boil volume of 5.9 gallons (22.3 L) and a gravity of 1.047 (11.8 °P). Stir thoroughly and bring to a boil.

The total wort boil time is 60 minutes. Add the bittering hops with 60 minutes remaining in the boil. I skip kettle finings for this beer. Chill the wort rapidly to 62 °F (17 °C), let the break material settle, rack to the fermenter, pitch the yeast and aerate thoroughly. The proper pitch rate is 10 grams of properly rehydrated dry yeast, two packages of liquid yeast or one package of liquid yeast in a 2-liter starter. Follow the remainder of the all-grain version of this recipe.

(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.060  FG = 1.013
IBU = 45  SRM = 5  ABV = 6.6%

Trillium’s website describes this beer as, "Layers of hops-derived aromas and flavors of citrus zest and tropical fruit rest on a pleasing malt backbone. Dangerously drinkable with a dry finish and soft mouthfeel from wheat. Our year round hoppy pale ale culminates in a restrained bitterness and dry finish."

Ingredients
10 lbs. (4.3 kg) 2-row pale malt
1.5 lbs. (0.68 kg) wheat malt
12 oz. (0.34 kg) dextrine malt
4 oz. (113 g) British pale crystal malt (22 °L)
3.5 AAU Columbus hops (60 min.) (0.25 oz./7 g at 14% alpha acids)
10.5 AAU Columbus hops (10 min.) (0.75 oz./21 g at 14% alpha acids)
2 oz. (57 g) Columbus hops (hop stand)
4 oz. (113 g) Citra® hops (dry hop)
1 oz. (28 g) Columbus hops (dry hop)
1⁄2 Whirlfloc® tablet (10 min.)
White Labs WLP007 (Dry English Ale) or Wyeast 1098 (British Ale) or Gigayeast GY054 (Vermont IPA) yeast
3⁄4 cups (150 g) dextrose (if priming)

Step by Step
Crush the malt and add to 4 gallons (15 L) strike water to achieve a stable mash temperature at 150 °F (65.5 °C) until enzymatic conversion is complete. Sparge slowly with 170 °F (77 °C) water, collecting wort until the pre-boil kettle volume is 6 gallons (23 L). Boil the wort for 60 minutes, adding the hops as indicated. After the boil is finished, cool the wort to 180 °F (82 °C) and then add the hop stand addition. Stir the wort, then let settle for 30 minutes before chilling the wort down to yeast-pitching temperature. Now transfer to the fermenter and pitch the yeast. Ferment at 68 °F (20 °C). As the kräusen begins to fall, typically day four or five, add the dry hops to the fermenter and let the beer sit on the hops for five days. Bottle with priming sugar or keg and force carbonate to 2.4 volumes CO2.

Extract with grains option:
Replace the 2-row pale malt and wheat malt in the all-grain recipe with 6.6 lbs. (3 kg) golden liquid malt extract and 1 lb. (0.45 kg) wheat dried malt extract. Reduce the dextrine malt 4 oz. (113 g). Place the crushed malt in a muslin bag. Steep the grains in 1 gallon (4 L) of water at 160 °F (71 °C) for 20 minutes. Remove the grain bag and wash with 2 qts. (2 L) of hot water. Top off the kettle to 5 gallons (19 L) and heat up to boil. As soon as the water begins to boil, remove the brew pot from the heat and stir in the dried and liquid malt extracts. Stir until all the extract is dissolved then return the wort to a boil. Boil the wort for 60 minutes. Follow the remaining portion of the all-grain recipe

Tips for Success:
Trillium Head Brewer JC Tetreault suggests building a water profile for this beer starting with soft water. "Supplement the mash with gypsum and calcium chloride to about a 2:1 ratio. This ensures sufficiently assertive hop character but still provides a softer finish." I think maybe a 100:50 ppm ratio would be a good starting point and you can adjust from there.

Handling the post fermentation beer with the utmost care to avoid introducing oxygen in any form is key in retaining those precious hop oils that Trillium Brewing Co. has become known for. JC adds his dry hops while primary fermentation is nearing completion, "in order to ensure good aromatic pre-cursor bioconversion. Ideally, dry hop in a keg under a little head pressure to avoid blowing off aromatics with the escaping carbonation. We strongly recommend force carbonating hop forward beers. Purge the keg with CO2 and add the dry hops in a fine mesh bag along with some sanitized stainless weights or glass marbles. Tie the fine mesh bag to the lid with some teflon floss (ie. Glide) to suspend the hops off the bottom of the keg." Beware of "beer volcanoes" when adding hops to the primary fermenter before terminal gravity, as the hops can create a nucleation point to release dissolved CO2, creating a volcano effect on the beer, which can lead to a significant amount of beer loss and a giant mess.

JC is also well known for having hop variations on base beer recipes. Don’t be afraid to substitute out Citra® in the dry hop for Mosaic™, Galaxy, or El Dorado®. He will also at times double dry hop his beers, so splitting the dry hops may help add a new dimension.

Build your water profile, starting with either very soft or RO water. Target a water profile of 200:100 PPM sulfate:chloride. Crush the malt and add to 4 gallons (15 L) strike water to achieve a stable mash temperature at 150 °F (65.5 °C). After 60 minutes, begin to lauter. Boil for 60 minutes, adding the first hop addition after the wort comes to a boil and a second hop addition with 10 minutes left in the boil. After the boil, chill the wort to 180 °F (82 °C) and then add the hop stand addition. Stir the wort, then let settle for 30 minutes before cooling to yeast pitching temperature. Ferment at 68 °F (20 °C). As the kräusen begins to fall, typically day 4 or 5, transfer to a keg with the dry hops and add a spunding valve. Let the beer sit on the hops for 4-5 days, then transfer to a serving keg or bottling bucket. You may want to cold-crash the beer prior to the transfer by dropping the temperature of the beer to 35 °F (2 °C) for 24 hours. Bottle with priming sugar or force carbonate the serving keg to 2.4 volumes CO2.

Extract with grains option:
Substitute the 2-row pale malt and wheat malt in the all-grain recipe with 6.6 lbs. (3 kg) golden liquid malt extract and 2 lbs. (0.91 kg) wheat dried malt extract, and reduce the dextrin malt addition to 4 oz. (113 g). Place the crushed malt in a muslin bag. Steep the grains in 6 gallon (23 L) water at 160 °F (71 °C) for 20 minutes. Remove the grain bag and wash with 2 qts. (2 L) hot water. Be sure to remove the wort from heat then stir in the dried and liquid malt extracts. Stir until all the extract is dissolved then return the wort to a boil. Boil for 60 minutes. Follow the remaining portion of the all-grain recipe.

White Labs WLP001 (American Ale) or Wyeast 1056 (American Ale ) or Safale US-05 yeast
0.75 cup (150 g) corn sugar (for priming)

Step by Step
Steep the crushed grain in 1.5 gallons (5.7 L) of water at 150 ºF (65.5 ºC) for 30 minutes. Remove grains from the wort and rinse with 2 quarts (1.8 L) of hot water. Add the liquid and dried malt extracts and bring to a boil. While boiling, add the hops, yeast nutrient and Irish moss as per the schedule. Now add the wort to 2 gallons (7.6 L) of cold water in the sanitized fermenter and top off with cold water up to 5 gallons (19 L). Cool the wort to 75 ºF (24 ºC). Pitch your yeast and aerate the wort heavily. Allow the beer to cool to 65 ºF (18.3 ºC). Hold at that temperature until fermentation is complete. Transfer to a carboy, avoiding any splashing to prevent aerating the beer. Allow the beer to condition for one week and then bottle or keg. Allow the beer to carbonate and age for two weeks.

All-grain option: This is a single step infusion mash using a total of 12.25 lbs. (5.6 kg) 2-row pale malt. Mix the crushed grains with 3.75 gallons (14 L) of 168 °F (75.5 °C) water to stabilize at 150 ºF (65.5 ºC) for 60 minutes. Sparge slowly with 175 ºF (79 °C) water. Collect approximately 6 gallons (23 L) of wort runoff to boil for 60 minutes. Reduce the 60 minute hop addition to 0.7 oz. (20 g) Magnum pellet hops to allow for the higher utilization factor of a full wort boil. The remainder of this recipe and procedures are the same as the extract with grain recipe.

Step by Step
Using a 5-gallon (19-L) kettle, start by steeping all the specialty grains (placed in a muslin bag) in about 2 gallons (7.5 L) of water at 152 °F (67 °C) for 15 minutes. Remove grain bag then add water bringing total volume in kettle to about 4 gallons (15 L). Bring liquid to or near a boil. Turn off the flame and slowly add half of the malt extract, stirring to avoid clumping or scorching. Adding just half of the extract maximizes hop isomerization. Turn flame back on and bring to boil. With 15 minutes left in the boil, add the remaining malt extract.

Follow the remainder of the all-grain recipe for boil, fermenting, and packaging instructions. After chilling the beer, but before pitching your yeast, remember to top up with water to 5 gallons (19 L).

Tropical Punch Red Ale
Tropical Red Ale
(5 gallons/19 L, partial mash)
OG = 1.061 FG = 1.014
IBU = 20 SRM = 15 ABV = 6.3%

Ingredients
2 lbs. (0.91 kg) two-row pale malt
1 lb. (0.45 kg) Munich malt
1 lb. (0.45 kg) medium crystal malt (50 to 60° L)
1 oz. (28 g) roasted barley
5 lbs. (2.3 kg) extra light dried malt extract
5 lbs. (2.3 kg) tropical fruit (see below)
3.6 AAU Warrior® hop pellets (45 min.) (0.25 oz./7 g at 14.5% alpha acid)
1 oz. (28 g) Simcoe® hop pellets (0 min.)
1.5 oz. (43 g) Citra® hop pellets (dry hop)
1.5 oz. (43 g) Galaxy hop pellets (dry hop)
Mangrove Jack's M15 (Empire Ale) or Safale S-04 or Lallemand London ESB yeast
3/4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Heat 1.5 gals. (5.7 L) of water to 163 °F (73 °C). Mix in pale, Munich, crystal malt and roasted barley (all crushed). The mash should settle at 150 to 152 °F (66 to 67 °C). Hold 60 minutes, then wash with 1.5 gals. (5.7 L) of water at 168 °F (76 °C). To the kettle add enough water to make at least 3 gals. (11 L) and bring the wort to a simmer. Remove from heat and add dried malt extract and Warrior® pellets. Bring back up to a boil and boil 45 minutes. Remove from heat and add the Simcoe® hops. Give wort a long stir to create a whirlpool and let settle for 15 minutes. Chill and top off with water to make 5.25 gals. in primary fermenter.

At 68 °F (20 °C) pitch a fruity, dry ale yeast. Ferment at 68 °F (20 °C) until initial fermentation cycle is complete. Rack to a secondary fermenter onto 5 lbs. (2.3 kg) of (your choice - any combination is cool!) pineapple, mango, banana, guava, papaya, passionfruit, starfruit, kiwi, lychee or orange. Secondary fermentation should last eight to 10 days, then re-rack to a third vessel to allow for clearing (a week or so should do it). Prime with corn sugar (add a few ounces of lactose if the beer seems too dry at this point). Bottle and age three to four weeks.

Alternatives and Options:
Obviously, the vast majority of alternatives in this recipe depend on your preferences for fruit. If it's fruit, you can use it. Just remember that the fruit will give a different element depending on how you use it. Fruit in the boil will give flavor but not much aroma. Fruit steeped in the cooling wort will contribute a little aroma but may or may not get adequately pasteurized. Fruit added to the primary will give good, fresh flavor (and will contribute fermentables, raising alcohol content slightly), but most of the aroma will bubble out with the CO2.

My favorite technique, mentioned above, is to pasteurize the fruit (I freeze it for several weeks and then microwave it to thaw it, which also kills a lot of bacteria), then put it into the bottom of my secondary. A 6-gal. carboy for a 5-gal. batch allows room for the fruit and renewed fermentation activity - occasionally I even have to install a blowoff tube on the secondary if I'm using a lot of fruit.

I then rack the more or less finished beer onto the fruit after initial fermentation subsides. I almost always then rack it again to get the beer off the fruit and allow it to clear. You can enhance or add to fruit flavors by adding fruit essences, extracts, or liqueurs with your priming sugar.

All-grain brewers:
Simply add 9.5 lbs. (4.3 kg) more of the pale malt to the grain bill, increase the mash water to 17 qts. (16 L) and the sparge water to 3.5 gals (13.2 L). Time and temperature remain the same. Simmer as above and boil to reduce to 5.25 gals. (20 L), keeping in mind the hopping schedule suggested.

Tropical Stout
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.071 FG = 1.016
IBU = 30 SRM = 56 ABV = 7.5%

I chose to balance this beer on the strong and sweet side of the style, so I’m shooting for an ABV of about 7.5%. The sweetness comes more from low bittering (30 IBUs) than from a high final gravity or the addition of lactose or any other sweetener.
Ingredients
10 lbs. (4.5 kg) Golden Promise pale ale malt
12 oz. (340 g) UK roasted barley
8 oz. (227 g) UK extra dark crystal (160 °L)
8 oz. (227 g) Carafa® Special III malt
4 oz. (113 g) UK chocolate malt
4 oz. (113 g) Belgian Special B malt
1.5 lbs. (0.68 kg) turbinado or other unrefined sugar (15 min.)
9 AAU UK Golding hops (60 min.)(1.5 oz./43 g at 6% alpha acids)
Wyeast 2124 (Bohemian Lager) or White Labs WLP830 (German Lager) or Mangrove Jack's M84 (Bohemian Lager) yeast
3⁄4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Two or three days before brew day, make a 2-qt. (2-L) yeast starter, aerating the wort thoroughly (preferably with oxygen) before pitching the yeast.

On brew day, prepare your ingredients; mill the grain, measure your hops, and prepare your water. This recipe uses reverse osmosis (RO) water. Add 1⁄4 tsp 10% phosphoric acid per 5 gallons (19 L) of brewing water, or until water measures pH 5.5 at room temperature. Add 1 tsp. calcium chloride (CaCl2) to the mash.

On brew day, mash in the pale ale malt at 152 °F (67 °C) in 18 qts. (17 L) of water, and hold this temperature for 60 minutes. Raise the temperature by infusion or direct heating to 158 °F (70 °C) for 15 minutes. Finally, raise to 168 °F (76 °C)to mashout. Add the remaining malts, and recirculate for 20 minutes. Fly sparge with 168 °F (76 °C) water until 6.5 gallons (25 L) of wort is collected.

Boil the wort for 90 minutes, adding the hops at times indicated in the recipe. The sugar is added directly to the boil with 15 minutes remaining. Chill to 59 °F (15 °C). Oxygenate the wort, then pitch the yeast starter. Ferment at 59 °F (15 °C) until fermentation is complete. Rack the beer and lager at 32 °F (0 °C) for 3 weeks. Prime and bottle condition, or keg and force carbonate to 2.5 volumes.

Tropical Stout
(5 gallons/19 L, extract with grains)
OG = 1.071 FG = 1.016
IBU = 30 SRM = 56 ABV = 7.5%

Ingredients
6.6 lbs. (3 kg) light liquid malt extract
12 oz. (340 g) UK roasted barley
8 oz. (227 g) UK extra dark crystal (160 °L)
8 oz. (227 g) Carafa® Special III malt
4 oz. (113 g) UK chocolate malt
4 oz. (113 g) Belgian Special B malt
1.5 lbs. (0.68 kg) turbinado or other unrefined sugar (15 min.)
9 AAU UK Golding hops (60 min.)(1.5 oz./43 g at 6% alpha acids)
Wyeast 2124 (Bohemian Lager) or White Labs WLP830 (German Lager) yeast
3⁄4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Use 6 gallons (23 L) of water in the brew kettle; heat to 158 °F (70 °C).

Place the dark grains and the crystal malts in a mesh bag and steep in the hot water for 30 minutes. Remove the mesh bag, then turn the heat off.

Add the liquid malt extract and stir thoroughly to dissolve the extract completely. You do not want to feel liquid extract at the bottom of the kettle when stirring with your spoon. Turn the heat back on and bring to a boil. Boil the wort for 60 minutes, adding the hops at the times indicated in the recipe. Add the sugar in the last 15 minutes of the boil.

Chill to 59 °F (15 °C). Oxygenate the wort, then pitch the yeast starter. Ferment at 59 °F (15 °C) until fermentation is complete. Rack the beer and lager at 32 °F (0 °C) for 3 weeks. Prime and bottle condition, or keg and force carbonate to 2.5 volumes.

IBU = 49 SRM = 71 ABV = 10.8%

Esoterik is a commemorative beer named in honor of Mr. Anthony Marraccini, who has contributed extensively to the work of the Arts Community of Easton, Pennsylvania – and it’s quite a tribute. The dark fruit really pops in this recipe, but only if you hold the alcohols in check.

Ingredients
15.5 lbs. (7 kg) Muntons Propino Pale malt (pale 2-row)
1.5 lbs. (0.68 kg) roasted barley
1 lb. (0.45 kg) Special B malt
0.5 lbs (0.23 kg) Caramunich III malt
0.5 lbs (0.23 kg) chocolate malt
0.5 lbs (0.23 kg) pale chocolate malt
1 lb. (0.45 kg) D2 candi syrup
13 AAU Nugget hops (60 min.) (1 oz./28 g at 13% alpha acid)
2 oz. (57 g) East Kent Goldings hops (0 min.)
White Labs WLP095 (Burlington Ale) or Gigayeast GY054 (Vermont Ale) or Imperial A04 (Barbarian) yeast
¾ cup (133 g) dextrose (if priming)

Step by Step
Mill the grains, then mix with 24.4 quarts (23.1 L) of 167 °F (75 °C) strike water to reach a mash temperature of 154 °F (68 °C). Hold this temperature for 60 minutes. Vorlauf until your runnings are clear, and sparge. Sparge the grains with enough water to obtain 6.5 gallons (24.6 L) of wort. Remove kettle from heat and stir in Belgian candi syrup until dissolved. Boil for 60 minutes, adding hops according to the ingredient list and Irish moss if desired.

After the boil, chill the wort to slightly below fermentation temperature, about 65 °F (18 °C). Aerate the wort with pure oxygen or filtered air and pitch yeast.

Ferment at 66 °F (19 °C), for the first two days, then free rise to 70 °F (21 °C) and hold there until the completion of primary fermentation. Once the beer completes fermentation, reduce temperature to 32 °F (0 °C), then bottle or keg the beer and carbonate to approximately 2.4 volumes.
Extract with Grains Option:
Omit the Muntons Propino Pale malt and add 10.75 lbs. (4.9 kg) Maris Otter liquid malt extract. Bring 5.4 gallons of water to approximately 162 °F (72 °C) and hold there. Steep grains for 20 minutes, then remove bag and allow to drain into the wort. Add liquid extract and Belgian candi syrup while stirring, and stir until completely dissolved. Boil for 60 minutes, adding hops according to the ingredient list and Irish moss if desired. Now follow the remainder of the all-grain recipe.

Tips for Success:
Head Brewer Josh Bushey recommends pitching more healthy yeast than you think you’ll need (and incidentally, if you can’t source the Vermont IPA strain from the various yeast providers, any alcohol-tolerant and mildly estery yeast will work, too). The relatively high mash temperature will add body, but the candi syrup will balance against that, leaving behind a beer that’s intensely flavorful and full but still quite drinkable.

Tips for Success:
One of the hurdles in crafting this beer will be mash pH management and how you handle the black malt if you’re an all-grain brewer. Personally, my well water is a bit on the hard side so the acidity that it brings allows me to hit a proper mash pH of 5.2–5.5 and so I add them right in the beginning of the mash. For others, you may want to consider adding the black malt during the vorlauf process (recirculation). The other sticking point will be dry hopping the beer as oxygen is the enemy of fresh, hoppy beer. Keg-to-keg transfers under CO2 atmospheres is probably your best bet. Don’t let the dry hopping go longer than 4 days for fear of extracting plant matter into the brew. But the option of performing a single, massive dry hop vs. dry hopping with individual varietals sequentially is completely up to you.

Ty Cobb's Georgia Peach Pilsner
Ty Cobb's Georgia Peach Pilsner
(5 gallons/19 L, partial mash)
OG = 1.054 FG = 1.012
IBU = 25 SRM = 5 ABV = 5.5%

Ingredients
2 lbs. (0.91 kg) continental Pilsner malt (preferably German)
0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) caramel pils malt
0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) Vienna malt
5 lbs. (2.3 kg) golden liquid light malt extract
1 lb. (0.45 kg) rice syrup solids
3 lbs. (1.4 kg) fresh peaches
8 AAU Tettnanger hops (35 min.) (2 oz./57 g at 4% alpha acids)
1 oz. (28 g) Hallertauer hops (5 min.)
Clean American lager yeast culture (such as Wyeast 2035)
7/8 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Heat 1 gal. (3.7 L) of water to 166 °F (74 °C), crush grains and add to the water, stirring in gently. Your mash should be about 154 °F (68 °C). Hold at this temperature for 90 min. Test with iodine for starch conversion, then begin runoff. Wash grains with 2 gal. (7.6 L) of water at 169 °F (76 °C). Add the malt extract and rice syrup solids to the kettle and bring to a boil. (Total boil time is 50 min.) Boil 15 min. and add Tettnanger hops. Boil 30 min. more.

Add Hallertauer hops (tied into a cheesecloth bag) and boil 5 min. more. Turn off heat and let cool 30 min. Add to your primary fermenter with enough pre-boiled cold water to make 5.25 gal. (20 L). When wort is cooled to 65 °F (18 °C), pitch your yeast culture. Allow fermentation to begin at 65 °F (18 °C), then gradually cool to 55 °F (13 °C) over the course of a couple of days (once fermentation has begun).

Hold fermenter at 55 °F (13 °C) for 10 days, then rack into secondary in which you have already placed the peaches, washed and cut up into small cubes. Lager at 50 °F (10 °C) on the peaches for 15 days and then you can rack again to a third vessel Lager at 40 °F (4 °C) for three to four weeks. Warm up to 65 °F (18 °C) for a day, then prime with corn sugar and bottle. Bottle condition at 45 to 50 °F (7 to 10 °C) for three to four weeks, then play ball!

Variations and Options:

All-grain recipe:
Same temperature mash, but increase the Pilsner malt to 9 lbs. (4.1 kg), caramel Pils to 1 lb. (0.45 kg), and use 1 lb. whole brewer's rice. Pre-cook the rice to gelatinize the starches for ease in conversion. You can also use flaked rice, if your supplier carries it, which doesn't need to be pre-cooked. Increase the mash water to 3.75 gal. (14.2 L) and the sparge water to 3.75 gal (14.2 L). Be sure to test for conversion on this mash.

Yeast:
Use a clean, fresh lager yeast culture, and pitch big to get off to a good start. Any so-called pilsner yeast will work, but Wyeast's American lager strains are particularly suited to the style.

Peaches:
Fresh? Well, use what you can find. But don't use canned, syrup-laden cling peaches, okay? No preservatives, no additives, no sugar. Just fresh fruit. To get more flavor and aroma extraction, try cutting it up, then freezing it for the time the beer is lagering, then microwaving it before you put it in the fermenter. Many homebrew suppliers carry, or can order, canned fruits for winemaking, which are preserved in their own juice only. These will certainly work fine too, although I haven't used the peaches that come this way. Also available are a couple different kinds of peach (and other fruit) flavor essence. These are not usually flavorful enough to really pack a zing, but they can help if the result at bottling just doesn't have enough to it. They can be added with the priming sugar, an ounce or two for five gallons.

This is a scaled down version of one of Unicorn Brewing’s top-selling pub beers named after its Founder, Cliff, and was his favorite. It works beautifully with Portland, Oregon’s soft brewing water. It’s clean and crisp enough for lager lovers and just fruity and spicy enough for folks looking for more. The rye addition is certainly not traditional but adds a nice complement to the fruitiness of Kölsch yeast. Since Kölsch beers are technically lagered ales, this is a great option for homebrewers who don’t have the ability to brew true lagers. You can ferment at room temperature and then cold-condition for an extended time. Kölsch yeast is notoriously slow to drop out of suspension, so give it at least a month cold. Your patience will be rewarded!

Wyeast 2565 (Kölsch), Imperial G03 (Dieter), or SafAle K-97
2⁄3 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
This is a single step infusion mash. Starting with a soft water profile or reverse osmosis water, add 1⁄2 tsp. calcium chloride. Mash in using 1.5 qts./lb. (3.1 L/kg) strike water, targeting a mash temperature of 149 °F (65 °C). Hold at this temperature for 60 minutes. Raise mash temperature for mash out at 168 °F (76 °C) and hold for five minutes before beginning to vorlauf. Once wort runs clear, begin run-off to the kettle and sparge with enough water to collect 6.5 gallons (25 L) wort in the kettle.

Bring wort to a boil and boil for 60 minutes adding hops per the ingredients list. Once the boil is complete, add the final hop addition, give the wort a long stir to create a whirlpool, then let settle for 10 minutes.

Chill the wort to 63 °F (17 °C), oxygenate if using liquid yeast, then pitch the yeast. Ferment at 65 °F (18 °C) for 10 days. Raise temperature to 70 °F (21 °C) for three days. Trans-fer to secondary vessel or dump the yeast before dropping down to a lagering temperature, roughly 40 °F (4 °C) and hold at this temperature for 2–3 weeks.

Transfer beer to serving keg or bottle and force carbonate using the priming sugar. Carbonate to 2.3 v/v.

What’s the secret to making a good barrel aged beer? "Good wood, great beer, a little imagination and lots of patience."
—Zac Triemert

Ingredients
13 lbs. (5.9 kg) Weyermann Pils malt
2.5 lbs. (1.1 kg) Weyermann Wheat malt
11 oz. (0.32 kg) Belgian sugar
11 oz. (0.32 kg) honey
5 AAU Liberty hops (60 min.) (1 oz./28 g of 5% alpha acids)
4 AAU Saaz hops (30 min.) (1 oz./28 g of 4% alpha acids)
1 oz. (28 g) Saaz hops (0 min.)
White Labs WLP500 (Trappist Ale) or Wyeast 3787 (Belgian Trappist Ale) yeast
1 cup corn sugar (for priming)

Step by Step
Mash at 149 °F (65 °C) for 75 min. Boil for 100 minutes. Ferment at ale temperatures. After primary fermentation, diacetyl rest for two days, then cool and filter.

After filtration, add the beer to a well-used 5-gallon (19-L) barrel with 50 g Brettanomyces anomalus (or substitute White Labs WLP645 (Brettanomyces claussenii) bacteria) and 50 g boiled malt extract. Let the beer mature for a year or more depending on your individual taste. However, please note that a new 5-gallon (19-L) oak cask will not work for this application. New wood and high surface area to volume ratio will significantly overoak the beer.

Extract Option
Omit Pilsner malt. Add 2 lb. 4 oz. (1.0 kg) Briess Light dried malt extract and 6 lb. 10 oz. (3.0 kg) Weyermann Pilsner liquid malt extract. Steep grains in 3.8 qts. (3.6 L) of water at 149 °F (65 °C) for 45 minutes.

Rinse with 1.9 qts. (1.8 L) of water at 170 °F (77 °C). Add water to make 3 gallons (11 L), add dried malt extract and bring to a boil. Boil for 60 minutes, stirring in liquid malt extract for final 15 minutes of boil.

Poor Man's Barrel Option:
Don’t have the budget (or room) for a barrel? Try this "poor man’s" method of emulating some of the aspects of barrel aging. Conduct your primary fermentation in a bucket or ferment the beer with ale yeast, then rack it to a bucket — adding any "bugs" that may be called for. Buckets are more permeable to oxygen than barrels are, so let the beer condition in the bucket for only about 3 months, then rack it to a carboy for the remaining conditioning time. Two weeks before racking, take 3.0 oz. (85 g) of oak cubes (French oak, medium toast) and soak them in wine. Use Chardonnay for the Temptation clone, Pinot Noir for La Roja, Cabernet Sauvignon for Darth Porter and Burgundy or Meritage for Grand Cru and La Folie. Change wine every 3 days to lessen the intensity of the new oak. Add cubes when beer is racked to carboy.

Urban Chestnut Brewing Co.’s Hallertau Haze clone
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.050 FG = 1.011
IBU = 25 SRM = 5 ABV = 5.2%

A departure for a brewery known for its lagers, this groundbreaking hazy IPA, designed for Urban Chestnut’s tenth anniversary, uses the best of Old World brewing tradition and modern craft innovation, and is brewed using 100% German hops and kveik yeast.

Ingredients
9 lbs. (4.1 kg) American 2-row pale ale malt
1.1 lbs. (0.5 kg) German wheat malt
0.1 lb. (45 g) Carahell® malt (11 °L)
1.5 AAU Hallertau Merkur hops (75 min.) (0.13 oz./3.7 g at 11.4% alpha acids)
8.4 AAU Mandarina Bavaria hops (0 min.) (1.1 oz./30 g at 8% alpha acids)
8.4 AAU Hallertau Blanc hops (0 min.) (0.88 oz./25 g at 9.5% alpha acids)
2.65 oz. (75 g) Hallertau Blanc hops (dry hop)
1.76 oz. (50 g) Huell Melon hops (dry hop)
1.76 oz. (50 g) Hallertau Mandarina hops (dry hop)
1⁄2 tsp. yeast nutrient
White Labs WLP520 (Sigmund Kveik), Omega yeast 061 (Voss Kveik), LalBrew Voss yeast, or The Yeast Bay WLP4045 (Sigmund’s Voss Kveik)
3⁄4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by step
Mash with 3.7 gallons (14 L) of water. Add 1 tsp. of gypsum and start your mash at 140 °F (60 °C). Raise temperature immediately to 153 °F (67 °C) and hold for 45 minutes. Next, raise temperature to 170 °F (78 °C) for mashout and recirculation. Begin collecting your wort and sparge with 176 °F (80 °C) water acidulated to a pH as close to 5.2 as possible.

Boil for 75 minutes, adding the bittering hop addition at the beginning of the boil. With 45 minutes to go, add 1 tsp. of gypsum to the boil. (Since some calcium ions get "consumed" during mashing, adding more during the boil assures a proper level required during fermentation.) Add 1⁄2 tsp. of yeast nutrient with 10 minutes to go in the boil.

Add flameout hop additions then whirlpool for 20 minutes. When settled, chill rapidly to 72 °F (22 °C) and oxygenate thoroughly. Ferment up to 75 °F (24 °C). Once attenuation is 50% complete, allow temperature to free rise to 79 °F (26 °C) for diacetyl rest and fermentation completion. When final gravity is reached, add the dry hops. 24 hours after dry hopping, chill to 41 °F (5 °C). Hold at this temperature for one day, then drop temperature to 34 °F (1 °C) for a 10-day maturation period. Keg and carbonate to 2.5 v/v or prime and bottle condition.

3⁄4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by step
Bring 3 gallons (11.4 L) of water to 160 °F (71 °C). Remove from heat and add your grains to a grain bag and submerge. Allow grains to steep for 20 minutes then remove grain bag and rinse with warm water. Slowly stir in the extract until fully dissolved. Bring wort to a boil and boil for 60 minutes, adding the hop additions as indicated.

Follow the remainder of the all-grain recipe, making sure to top up the fermenter to 5 gallons (19 L) before pitching yeast.

Tips for success:
Fermentation temperatures in the mid- to upper-70s °F (24–26 °C) is on the cool end for kveik strains, which are often fermented in the 90s °F (mid-30s °C) and warmer. Florian Kuplent says there are a couple of reasons he does this, which he acknowledges is based on "gut feel" and experience, not scientific data to back it up. "I prefer to control fermentation and like to not overly stress yeast — high temps seem to do that more. (And) with a lower fermentation temperature the fermentation is less vigorous, which removes fewer volatiles (aroma compounds we look for in the beer)." That said, you will notice yeast manufacturers suggest the optimal temperature to ferment this strain (depending on which manufacturer’s yeast you use) ranges from around 70–100 °F (21–38 °C), so you have the option to turn up the heat.

This is a "milkshake IPA" using lactose and lime zest. Head Brewer of Urban Family Brewing (Seattle, Washington) Isaac Koski says the dry hop addition in this beer rotates among citrusy hops including Citra®, Simcoe®, or Motueka. "These are interchangeable in my mind based on availability and how they are smelling."

INGREDIENTS
11 lbs. (5 kg) 2-row pale malt
2.5 lbs. (1.13 kg) flaked oats
1 lb. (0.45 kg) rice hulls
4 oz. (113 g) acidulated malt
1.75 lbs. (0.79 kg) lactose sugar
4.75 AAU Centennial hops (60 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 9.5% alpha acids)
4 oz. (113 g) Citra® hops (dry hop)
1-2 limes, zested
1 vanilla bean, split and chopped
White Labs WLP002 (English Ale), Wyeast 1968 (London ESB Ale), or your favorite English yeast
3⁄4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

STEP BY STEP

Mash in with a standard mash at 1.25 qts./lb. (2.6 L/kg) at 155 °F (68 °C) until fully converted, about 60 minutes. Sparge with enough water to collect 6.5 gallons (24.6 L) of wort in the kettle. Boil 60 minutes, adding sole hop addition at the beginning of the boil. Add the lactose powder to the boil at any point. Chill, aerate, and then ferment at 67 °F (19 °C) with your favorite English ale strain. On brew day, zest the lime and chop the vanilla bean. Add vodka to bowl to just cover the zest and bean, then cover with saran wrap. Let soak in vodka during active fermentation. Dry hop in secondary with a citrus-forward hop such as Citra® but you can substitute in Simcoe®, Motueka, or a favorite citrusy hop of yours. Add tincture of lime zest and vanilla bean at dry hopping. After achieving the desired dry hop character, cold crash and package.

Urgwawa - Rwandan Banana Beer
Rwandan Banana Beer Recipe (Urwagwa)
Ingredients
30 kg (66 lbs.) green bananas
Ishinge grass (local reed grass)
2 kg. (4.4 lbs.) roasted sorghum
5 L (1.3 gal) water

Instructions
This recipe should yield approximately 15 L (4 gal) of banana beer. Place bananas underground for 4-5 days to accelerate ripening and ensure all fruits are ripened to the same level of sweetness. Peel bananas and mix with local Ishinge grass together into a mash. Do not add water. Knead by hand for about 1 hour until banana juice is extracted. Adding the grass to the banana mash provides friction which helps to extract the banana juice. Push banana and grass mash to one end of a mixing container and squeeze tightly to extract as much juice as possible. Place juice aside. Run additional 5 liters of water through banana mash to extract all the juice (sparge the bananas). Pound the roasted sorghum into a fine flour, then add to banana juice. Sorghum provides flavoring and a natural yeast. Ferment for 3-5 days and serve.

This New England IPA relies almost entirely on South African hops, giving it a unique flavor with notes of tangerine and strawberry.

Ingredients
11 lbs. (5 kg) Rahr pale malt
5.9 oz. (167 g) Carafoam® malt
2.9 oz. (82 g) acidulated malt
5.2 AAU Mosaic® hops (30 min.) (0.4 oz./11 g at 13.0% alpha acids)
5.6 AAU Southern Passion hops (15 min) (0.5 oz./14 g at 11.2% alpha acids)
2.4 oz. (68 g) Southern Passion hops (hop stand)
2.6 oz. (74 g) African Queen hops (dry hop)
2.6 oz. (74 g) Southern Aroma hops (dry hop)
2.6 oz. (74 g) Southern Passion hops (dry hop)
Yeast nutrient (10 min.)
1⁄2 Whirlfloc tablet (5 min.)
Imperial Yeast Dry Hop A24 or LalBrew New England and LalBrew Verdant IPA yeast blend
2⁄3 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
This recipe calls for reverse osmosis water. Build your water profile to achieve 113 ppm calcium, 62 ppm sulfates, and 41 ppm chloride.

Mill the grains and dough-in targeting a mash of around 1.25 quarts of water to 1 pound of grain (2.6 L/kg) and a temperature of 150 °F (66 °C). Hold the mash at 150 °F (66 °C) until conversion is complete and the gravity is stable as read by refractometer. Sparge slowly with 170 °F (77 °C) water, collecting wort until the pre-boil kettle volume is 7 gallons (26.5 L).

Total boil time is 75 minutes. Add the boil hops, yeast nutrients (per manufacturer’s recommendation), and Whirlfloc as indicated. After the boil is complete, chill the wort to 185 °F (85 °C) and give the wort a thorough stir. Add hop stand hops to slowly turning wort and whirlpool the wort for 20 minutes. Knock out to 68 °F (20 °C), aerate thoroughly, and pitch yeast (note that if using dry yeast, you should pitch both dry strains recommended as Imperial’s A24 is a blend of the two strains).

When fermentation has reached terminal gravity, add dry hops to fermenter and wait five days before transferring off the dry hops and packaging. Carbonate the beer to around 2.3–2.4 volumes of CO2. If bottling conditioning, you may consider pitching fresh yeast at bottling.

Varietal Mead
Varietal Mead
(5 gallons/19 L)
OG = 1.120 FG = 1.012 ABV = 14%

Most of the traditional mead recipes that I make follow this ratio: 1 part honey, 3 parts water. Using that ratio, it’s easy to scale a batch up or down as needed.

Ingredients

15 lbs. (6.8 kg) single-varietal honey
3.75 gallons (14.2 L) non-chlorinated water
12.5 g Go-Ferm
5.3 g Fermaid-O
10 g (2 packets) Lalvin Narbonne 71B-1122 dry yeast

Step by step (meadmaking day)
Sanitize the fermenting equipment — fermenter, lid or stopper, airlock, funnel, etc. — along with the yeast pack and a pair of scissors.

Fill a sink or cooler with hot tap water and soak honey container(s) to make the honey easier to pour. I don’t recommend using boiling water; be patient. If your honey is crystallized, don’t worry — all raw and natural honey crystallizes over time (with the exception of Tupelo blossom honey), especially in colder temperatures. Soaking the honey container in hot water will turn it back into liquid form. Pour honey into the fermenter.

Using the honey containers, collect room temperature water one container at a time and fill the fermenter to a total volume of 5 gallons (19 L). Get every drop of honey out of the containers (placing the lid on and shaking may be necessary, as may using a small portion of warmer water in the containers). Remember, it takes a bee its entire life to make 1⁄12 of a teaspoon of honey.

Place a 1⁄2 cup of the warm water/honey mix (now called must) in a measuring cup and save for step 6.

Stir the must until all honey is dissolved and well mixed. This usually takes 5 to 15 minutes, possibly longer.

Prepare yeast. Add 4.5 tsp. of Go-Ferm to the 1⁄2 cup of must, then mix. Let the mixture cool to 104 °F (40 °C) then add the active dried yeast. Let stand for 20 minutes. Slowly (over 5 minutes) add equal amounts of must to the yeast slurry. Watch the temperature difference. Do not allow more than 18 °F (10 °C) difference between the must and the yeast slurry. Temperate as necessary.

After 15 minutes (yeast should begin to foam), stir well to mix the yeast into a slurry. Pour the yeast slurry into the fermenter.

Seal fermenter with a sanitized airlock and keep fermenter in an area of about 64–68 °F (18–20 °C).

Fermentation should start within 24 hours.

(First 1–2 weeks)
Sanitize all equipment used to stir the must for each nutrient addition. Please note that adding nutrient and stirring may cause the mead to foam so care must be taken to do this slowly. A slow stir before adding the nutrient will allow the release of residual CO2. Follow this staggered nutrient schedule:

• Add 5.3 grams of Fermaid-O at 24 hours after fermentation begins.

• Add 5.3 grams of Fermaid-O at 48 hours after fermentation begins.

• Add 5.3 grams of Fermaid-O at 72 hours after fermentation begins.

(Secondary fermentation)

By monitoring your airlock activity, you will notice the slowing down of fermentation. Depending on many factors this could be somewhere after one month, but often I would plan for three months. Your mead then is ready to be transferred to a secondary fermenter. Sanitize your fermenter and siphoning equipment.

Carefully siphon the mead into the fermenter. Leave as much sediment as possible in the primary fermenter.

Let the mead clarify in the secondary fermenter for three months. I prefer to either filter or let it naturally drop brilliantly clear. Alternatively you may wish to add a fining agent such as isinglass to facilitate clearing, and/or potassium sorbate to prevent further fermentation.

(Bottling day, 3.5 months after beginning)

Sanitize siphoning and bottling equipment and bottles. Carefully siphon the mead to a bottling bucket. I recommend this mead be made still, but if you wish to carbonate it you would add priming sugar at this point.

Fill and cap bottles like you would any beer you were making.

Bottles may be consumed at any time, but a general rule of thumb is two weeks after bottling or kept and aged for six months or more to achieve superior flavor.

Venkman's Vit
Venkman's Vit
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.052 FG = 1.013
IBU = 20 SRM = 15 ABV = 5.1%

You can think of this beer as a cross between a wit beer and and a schwarzbier, although it is not quite that dark. Venkman's Vit is finished with Sterling hops (whose character is seen by some as a cross between Saaz and Mt. Hood hops) and spiced with the zest from an Oro Blanco Grapefruit (which is a cross between a grapefruit and a pummelo) and should appeal to anyone who thinks that "crossing the streams" might be a great idea.

Ingredients
6 lb. 5 oz. (2.9 kg) Pilsner malt
4 lb. 3 oz. (1.9 kg) wheat malt
2.5 oz. (71 kg) dehusked black patent
4.5 AAU Santiam hops (60 min.) (0.75 oz./21 g of 6% alpha acids)
0.5 oz. (14 g) Sterling hops (10 min.)
Oro Blanco Grapefruit zest (1/2 fruit)
Wyeast 3463 (Forbidden Fruit) yeast
1.0 cup cane sugar (for priming)

Step by Step
Mash at 152 °F (67 °C) in 16 qts. (15 L) of mash liquor. Collect 5.5 gallons (21 L) of wort, add 1.0 gallon (3.8 L) of water and boil vigorously for 90 minutes. Ferment starting at 70 °F (21 °C). Let temperature rise to 76 °F (24 °C) when fermentation slows. Add zest in secondary and carbonate to around 2.7–3.0 volumes of CO2. (If bottling, use heavy bottles, like the bottles that German wheat beers are packaged in.)

This crisp lager is just the thing for fall weather. It boasts a balanced malt profile with an herbal, German hop profile.

Ingredients
11 lbs. (5 kg) Pilsner malt
0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) Carapils® malt
2 AAU Hallertau Tradition hops (60 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 4% alpha acids)
2 AAU Hallertau Mittelfrüh hops (30 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 4% alpha acids)
4.5 AAU Tettnang hops (15 min.) (1 oz./28 g at 4.5% alpha acids)
Wyeast 2124 (Bohemian Lager) or White Labs WLP830 (German Lager) yeast
2⁄3 cup (133 g) dextrose (if priming)

Step by Step
This recipe calls for a decoction mash, which Victory does! Infuse the grains with 3.6 gallons (13.6 L) of water to stabilize the mash at 122 °F (50 °C). Then raise the mash temperature to 145 °F (63 °C) and hold for 10 minutes. Pull 1⁄3 of the mash and decoct, going through a 15-minute rest at 158 °F (70 °C) before boiling. Mix back into the main mash, hold for 20 minutes, and then raise to 168 °F (76 °C) for mash-off. Vorlauf until your runnings are clear. Sparge the grains with 3.6 gallons (13.6 L) and top up as necessary to obtain 6 gallons (23 L) of wort. Boil for 60 minutes, adding hops according to the ingredient list and Irish moss as desired. After the boil, chill the wort to slightly below fermentation temperature, about 48 °F (9 °C). Aerate the wort with pure oxygen or filtered air and pitch yeast. Ferment at 50 °F (10 °C) until gravity reaches about 1.025, then increase temperature to 54 °F (12 °C) and hold for two days. Once the beer completes fermentation, reduce temperature to 32 °F (0 °C) over the course of one week, and hold there for at least six weeks. After cold conditioning, bottle or keg the beer and carbonate to approximately 2.25 volumes.

Extract with grains option:
Substitute the Pilsner malt in the all-grain recipe with 7.5 lbs. (3.4 kg) Pilsner liquid malt extract. Bring 5.4 gallons (20.4 L) of water to approximately 165 °F (74 °C) and hold there, steeping the specialty malt in a grain bag for 15 minutes. Remove the grain bag, and let drain fully. Add liquid extract while stirring. Bring the wort to a boil. Follow the remaining portion of the all-grain recipe

Tips for Success:
Victory Co-Founder Ron Barchet recommends, above and beyond anything else, getting your hands on the best possible ingredients, and to look a little deeper into the composition of those ingredients than you ordinarily would. For example, if you can get German Pils malt that uses Steffi or Barke barley varieties, you will notice a particularly characterful maltiness. He also notes that it is a good idea for homebrewers to rack the beer off of its yeast cake before cold conditioning to minimize the risk of yeast autolysis and any loss of foam quality. Finally, be sure to pour vigorously (preferably into a proper Isar Krug mug!) to release all of the wonderful aromatics in this beer.

1 Whirlfloc tablet (15 min.)
Wyeast 1056 (American Ale), White Labs WLP001 (California Ale), or LalBrew BRY-97 (West Coast Ale) yeast
3⁄4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Mash in at 122 °F (50 °C) employing a medium-thin mash. Hold at 122 °F (50 °C) for 10 minutes. Raise temperature to 149 °F (65 °C) and hold for 10 minutes. Raise temperature again to 158 °F (70 °C) and hold for 15 minutes. Raise to 170 °F (77 °C) for mash out.

Recirculate for 10 minutes, or until clear. Once the wort is running fairly clear, start wort collection. Begin sparging the grains when they are first exposed during runoff, collecting 6.5 gallons (25 L) of wort.

Boil for 90 minutes, adding ingredients at times indicated. If using whole flower hops, use a big enough bag to contain them while allowing proper circulation. Otherwise, use pellet hops, because it is imperative to have proper hop/wort contact time. When boil is complete, whirlpool and let set for 20 minutes. Chill to 61 °F (16 °C) and transfer to fermenter. Pitch a healthy, large amount of yeast and oxygenate thoroughly if using liquid yeast. Pitch at 61 °F (16 °C) and allow to ferment at 64 °F (18 °C). When beer falls below 1.030 SG, raise fermentation temperature to 68 °F (20 °C) to finish fermentation. Hold there until no diacetyl is detected, usually 1–2 days. Rack to remove yeast.

Cool to 50 °F (10 °C) and add dry hops. Hold at 50 °F (10 °C) for three days then remove or rack off. Cool the beer down to 32 °F (0 °C) over 3–4 days, then hold at or below 32 °F (0 °C) for a minimum of 1 week. Force carbonate to 2.5 v/v or add priming sugar to bottle ferment for carbonation.

Extract with grains version:
Replace the Pilsner and acidulated malts with 6.75 lbs. (3.1 kg) Pilsen dried malt extract and 1/2 tsp. 88% lactic acid. Heat 3 gallons (11 L) of water to about 155 °F (68 °C) and steep the caramel malt in a muslin bag for 15 minutes. Meanwhile, pre-boil then chill 3 gallons (11 L) of water to use later for topping up the fermenter. Once the steeping is complete, remove the bag, letting the liquid drain into the kettle.

Raise to near-boiling temperatures, remove pot from flame and stir in half of the malt extract. Return to flame and boil for 50 minutes, adding the hops according to the schedule in the ingredient list. Add the gypsum with the first hop addition, the Yeastex and Whirlfloc with 15 minutes remaining, and the remainder of the dried malt extract with 5 minutes left in the boil.

Follow the remainder of the all-grain recipe, topping the fermenter up to 5 gallons (19 L) after chilling with pre-boiled water.

Tips for success:
Dextrose is added late in this recipe simply to boost gravity while keeping the beer’s color intact (as opposed to the Storm King recipe where it is added earlier to aid in additional color development).

The timing and temperature of the dry hopping step can greatly influence the dry hop character of the finished beer. To best replicate DirtWolf, dry hop at 50 °F (10 °C) for the right balance of pure dry hop grassiness (a little), the juicy tropical notes (a fair amount), and citrus (a fair amount).

Collect 6.5 gallons (25 L) of water to account for boil-off and boil for 90 minutes, adding the hops according to the specified schedule in the ingredient list. When boil is complete, whirlpool and let set for about 20 minutes. Chill to 63 °F (17 °C) and transfer to fermenter, pitching twice as much yeast as usual. Oxygenate light to normal if using a liquid yeast strain. Note: Less oxygenation may increase some of the yeast character. As fermentation slows, allow temperature to rise to 65 °F (18 °C) to finish fermenting. Hold the beer at 65 °F (18 °C) until no diacetyl and minimal sulfur is detected, usually 1–2 days. Remove yeast or rack beer off yeast.

Cool the beer down to 32 °F (0 °C) over 3–4 days and hold for a minimum of two days.

Carbonate to 2.6 v/v or add priming sugar to bottle ferment for carbonation.

(5 gallons/19 L, extract only)
OG = 1.055 FG = 1.008
IBU =30 SRM = 4 ABV = 6.2%

Ingredients
5.1 lbs. (2.3 kg) Pilsen dried malt extract
1 lb. (0.45 kg) wheat dried malt extract
1 tsp. 88% lactic acid
6 AAU Spalt Select hops (40 min.) (1.2 oz./34 g at 5% alpha acids)
3.3 AAU Spalt Select hops (30 min.) (0.66 oz./19 g at 5% alpha acids)
Wyeast 3787 (Belgian High Gravity), White Labs WLP570 (Belgian Golden Ale), or Mangrove Jack’s M41 (Belgian Ale) yeast
¾ cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by step
Raise 3 gallons (11 L) of clean brewing water to near-boiling temperatures, remove pot from flame and slowly stir in 3 lbs. (1.35 kg) Pilsen dried malt extract (DME). Return to flame and bring to boil. Meanwhile, pre-boil then chill 3 gallons (11 L) of water to use later for topping up the fermenter.

Boil wort for 90 minutes, adding the hops according to the specified schedule in the ingredient list and lactic acid at the start of the boil. A vigorous, rolling boil is ideal, but watch closely to avoid a boilover. Add the remainder of the DME with 5 minutes left in the boil.

Upon completion of the boil, chill to 63 °F (17 °C) and transfer to fermenter, adding pre-boiled and chilled water to top up fermenter to a total volume of 5 gallons (19 L). Pitch twice as much yeast as usual. Aerate light to normal if using a liquid yeast strain. Note: Less oxygenation may increase some of the yeast character. As fermentation slows, allow temperature to rise to 65 °F (18 °C) to finish fermenting. Hold the beer at 65 °F (18 °C) until no diacetyl and minimal sulfur is detected, usually 1–2 days. Remove yeast or rack beer off yeast.

Cool the beer down to 32 °F (0 °C) over 3–4 days and hold for a minimum of two days.

Carbonate to 2.6 v/v or add priming sugar to bottle ferment for carbonation.

Tips for success:
Package within 3 weeks of brewing to accentuate the yeasty mouthfeel.

Experimenting with the oxygenation rates will result in slightly different aroma profiles. For more ester production, try limiting the oxygenation. For a cleaner aroma and finish, oxygenate more vigorously.

Another option is to experiment with a new strain of Belgian yeast that is POF- (phenolic off-flavor negative). The yeast strains listed in this recipe are all POF+. Omega’s OYL-400 (Bananza) is one such strain that is a POF- weiss strain.

(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.047 FG = 1.006
IBU = 45 SRM = 3 ABV = 5.3%

Ingredients
9 lbs. (4.1 kg) German Pilsner malt
4 oz. (113 g) acidulated malt
1.6 AAU Hallertau Mittelfrüh hops (60 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 3.1% alpha acids)
2.3 AAU Hallertau Mittelfrüh hops (15 min.) (0.75 oz./21 g at 3.1% alpha acids)

1.6 oz. (45 g) Tettnang whole hops (hopback)
0.5 oz. (15 g) Spalt whole hops (hopback)
0.15 oz. (4 g) Spalt Select whole hops (hopback) 
0.28 oz. (8 g) Czech Saaz whole hops (hopback)

(Bohemian Lager) yeast
7⁄8 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Using a medium-thin mash, achieve a protein rest mash temperature of 122 °F (50 °C). Hold at 122 °F (50 °C) for 20 minutes. Raise to 149 °F (65 °C) and hold for 45 minutes for beta amylase conversion. Raise to 158 °F (70 °C) and hold for 15 minutes for additional alpha amylase conversion. Raise to 170 °F (77 °C) for mash out. Recirculate for 10 minutes. Once the wort is running fairly clear, begin wort collection.

Begin sparging the grains when they are first exposed during runoff. Using sparge water around 5.2 pH is ideal. Collect 6.5 gallons (25 L) of wort.

Boil for 90 minutes, adding ingredients at times indicated. A vigorous, rolling boil is critical to limiting dimethyl sulfide (DMS). If using whole flower hops, use a big enough bag to contain them while allowing proper circulation. Otherwise, use pellet hops to have proper hop/wort contact time to achieve the correct results.

Once boil is complete, whirlpool through your hopback (or add these hops directly to your kettle if you don’t have a hopback or are using pellet hops), and let settle for 20 minutes. Chill as quickly as possible, then transfer to a sanitized fermenter. Once wort is at 52 °F (11 °C), pitch yeast and oxygenate thoroughly if using liquid yeast or repitching from a slurry. (Being a lager, it’s best to pitch at least double the amount of yeast as you would for an ale. You can accomplish this by making a starter if using liquid yeast, or pitching two sachets.) Pitch at 52 °F (11 °C) and let the beer ferment for about two weeks. Allow to rise to 56 °F (13 °C) to finish fermenting. Hold the beer at 56 °F (13 °C) until no diacetyl is detected, usually 1–3 days. Remove yeast or rack beer off of it.

Slowly cool the beer down to 32 °F (0 °C) over 10–14 days, then hold at or below 32 °F (0 °C) for a minimum of one week, but a longer lagering period of a few weeks is even better. If you plan to fine or filter the beer, do so before packaging. Package with proper carbonation of 2.7 v/v or add priming sugar to bottle ferment for carbonation.

Extract only version:
Replace malts with 5.1 lbs. (2.3 kg) Pilsen dried malt extract and 1 tsp. 88% lactic acid. Heat 3 gallons (11 L) of clean brewing water to near-boiling temperatures, remove from flame and slowly stir in half of the malt extract. Return to flame and bring to boil. Boil for 60 minutes, adding the hops according to the specified schedule in the ingredient list. Add Whirlfloc and Yeastex with 10 minutes left in the boil, and the remainder of the malt extract with 5 minutes remaining.

Follow the remainder of the all-grain recipe, topping the fermenter up to 5 gallons (19 L) after chilling with pre-boiled water.

Tips for success:
The correct amount of clean, healthy yeast (coupled with good aeration if using liquid yeast) will result in a clean fermentation, which will allow all of the malt and hops goodness to shine.

High-quality hops in their freshest state will impart that beautiful bouquet. It is better to use fresh hops that are not on the ingredient list than to use older, less fresh hops that are.

Ingredients
13.5 lbs. (6.1 kg) Pilsner malt
2.25 lbs. (1 kg) Vienna malt
3 oz. (86 g) Caramunich® malt (58 °L)
11 oz. (325 g) Carafa® Special III

¾ cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Mash in all malts (except the unmalted roasted barley) at 122 °F (50 °C) with a medium thick mash. Raise to 149 °F (65 °C) and hold for 45 minutes. Raise temperature again to 158 °F (70 °C) and hold for 30 minutes. Raise temperature once more to 170 °F (77 °C) for mash out. Spread the roasted barley grist evenly over the top of the grain bed. Recirculate for 10 minutes, or until clear. Once the wort is running fairly clear, begin wort collection. Lauter slowly to avoid a stuck lauter bed. Begin sparging the grains when they are first exposed during runoff, collecting 6.5 gallons (25 L) of wort.

Boil for 90 minutes, adding ingredients at times indicated. If using whole flower hops, use a big enough bag to contain them while allowing proper circulation. Otherwise, use pellet hops, because it is imperative to have proper hop/wort contact time to achieve the correct results.

When the boil is complete, whirlpool and let set for 20 minutes. After whirlpool has settled, chill to 59 °F (15 °C) and transfer to the fermenter. Pitch a large, healthy amount of yeast and oxygenate thoroughly. As fermentation begins to slow, let rise to 60 °F (16 °C) to finish fermenting. Hold the beer at 60 °F (16 °C) until no diacetyl is detected, usually 1–2 days. Remove yeast or rack beer off yeast.

Cool the beer down to 32 °F (0 °C) over 3–4 days, then hold at or below 32 °F (0 °C) for a minimum of one week. Fine before packaging if desired. Carbonate to 2.55 v/v or add priming sugar to bottle ferment for carbonation.

Extract with grains version:
Replace Pilsner and Vienna malts with 7.3 lbs. (3.3 kg) Pilsen dried malt extract and 1.3 lbs. (0.6 kg) Goldpils® Vienna dried malt extract.

Heat 3 gallons (11 L) of water to about 155 °F (68 °C) and steep the caramel, Carafa®, and roasted barley in a muslin bag for 15 minutes. Once the steeping is complete, remove the bag, letting the liquid drain into your kettle. Raise to near-boiling temperatures, remove pot from flame and slowly stir in 4.3 lbs./2 kg of the Pilsen dried malt extract. Return to flame and bring to boil for 60 minutes, adding ingredients per the schedule and the remainder of the malt extract with 5 minutes left in boil.

Follow the remainder of the all-grain recipe, topping the fermenter up to 5 gallons (19 L) after chilling with pre-boiled water.

Tips for success:
The roasted barley and Carafa® (in the all-grain version) can make lautering difficult. Start slow and steady and only increase the rate of runoff midway through sparging.

The correct amount of clean, healthy yeast, good oxygenation (if using liquid yeast strain), and the cooler recommended fermentation temperature will result in a clean fermentation that will allow all of the malt and hop goodness to shine.

The mashing and fermentation should be intense, as one of the unique aspects of this recipe is it should yield a well-attenuated beer, with a mouthfeel more similar to a double IPA than the typical imperial stout. Mashing a little longer won’t hurt, but not mashing long enough may be problematic.

Ingredients
9.5 lbs. (4.3 kg) German Pilsner malt
5.25 lbs. (2.4 kg) dark Munich malt (9 °L)
12 oz. (340 g) Caramunich® III malt (58 °L)
12 oz. (340 g) Weyermann Beechwood Smoked malt
8 oz. (227 g) Caraaroma® malt (150 °L)
2.5 oz. (70 g) Carafa® Special I malt
5.3 AAU Tettnang Mittelfrüh hops (60 min.) (1.33 oz./38 g at 4% alpha acids)
3 AAU Tettnang Mittelfrüh hops (15 min.) (0.75 oz./21 g at 4% alpha acids)

SafLager W-34/70, White Labs WLP830 (German Lager), or Wyeast 2124
(Bohemian Lager) yeast
3⁄4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Mash in at 122 °F (50 °C) using a thick mash. Immediately raise to 149 °F (65 °C) and hold for 10 minutes. Remove about a third of the mash using a colander to strain out most of the liquid. Raise this portion to 158 °F (70 °C), hold for 10 minutes, then raise to boil and boil for 15 minutes. Move the boiling mash to the main mash and stir, with the combined mash hitting a temperature of 158 °F (70 °C).

Decoct again, removing about 30% of the mash, and bring it to a boil for 5 minutes. Move the boiling mash to the main mash and stir, with the combined mash hitting a temperature of 170 °F (77 °C). Recirculate for 10 minutes, or until clear, and then begin wort collection.

Begin sparging the grains when they are first exposed during runoff, collecting 6.5 gallons (25 L) of wort to account for the longer boil. Boil for 90 minutes, adding the hops, Yeastex, and Whirlfloc according to the specified schedule in the ingredient list.

Chill to 52 °F (11 °C) and transfer to the fermenter. Pitch a large, healthy dose of yeast and oxygenate thoroughly if using a liquid yeast strain. Three packages of yeast in a starter or two packages started separately should give you the right amount of liquid yeast to effectively ferment this huge beer. If using dried yeast, pitch three sachets. As fermentation begins to slow, allow to rise to 58 °F (14 °C) to finish fermenting. Hold the beer at 58 °F (14 °C) until no diacetyl is detected, usually 2–4 days. Rack beer to remove yeast.

Cool the beer down to 32 °F (0 °C) over 7–10 days and hold for a minimum of four weeks. Force carbonate to 2.6 v/v or add priming sugar to bottle ferment.

Partial mash version:
Replace Pilsner malt with 5.2 lbs. (2.36 kg) Pilsen dried malt extract. This large lager will require a 3-step extract process. The main base malt will come from the dried malt extract, while the dark Munich and smoked malt will need to be mashed. The caramel and Carafa® malts will only need to be steeped.

Raise 3 gallons (11 L) of clean brewing water to achieve a mash temperature of 149 °F (65 °C) once you add the muslin bag containing the crushed Munich and smoked malts. Hold for at least 60 minutes. Meanwhile, pre-boil then chill 3 gallons (11 L) of water to use later for topping up the fermenter. During the last 15 minutes of the mash, add the muslin bag of steeping grains (containing the caramel and Carafa® malts). Once the mash/steeping is complete, remove the bags, letting the liquid drain into the kettle.

Raise to near-boiling temperatures, remove pot from flame and slowly stir in half of the malt extract. Return to flame and bring to boil for 60 minutes. Add ingredients at times indicated and the remainder of the malt extract with 5 minutes left in the boil.

Follow the remainder of the all-grain recipe, topping the fermenter up to 5 gallons (19 L) after chilling with pre-boiled water.

Tips for success:
The decoction mashing (in the all-grain version) can make lautering difficult. Start slow and steady and only increase the rate of runoff after you have begun sparging.

The decoction routine in this recipe took several iterations to hit the correct temperatures so use this as a guide knowing you may need to adjust to the peculiarities of your system. Decoction does increase the color, so if you cannot (or do not want to) use the described decoction method, increase one of the darker malts to achieve the same color.

As with all lagers, but particularly strong dextrinous doppelbocks, yeast quantity and quality is critical to determine the ultimate drinkability and quality of the beer.

It is practically impossible to over age this beer. As it ages, the flavors smooth, and the drinkability increases. Victory prefers a minimum tank time of two months but even better results can be achieved in 3–4 months.

Step by Step
Starting on brew day, in a sealed container cover 1 oz. (28 g) of oak chips in your favorite gin. Heat 4 gallons (15.2 L) of strike water to 162 °F (72 °C). Mash all the grains at 148 °F (64 °C) for 75 minutes before beginning the mashout process. Collect 6.5 gallons (24.6 L) of wort and bring to a boil for 60 minutes, adding hops as indicated. After flameout, give the wort a long stir to create a whirlpool and let settle for several minutes.

Chill wort to yeast-pitching temperature, aerate, then pitch the yeast. Ferment at 68 °F (20 °C) for roughly one week, then add the dry hops. At this time, pour the gin off the oak and replace with a dry white wine like Sauvignon Blanc. When the beer is ready for transfer, rack into an appropriate fermenter or keg and add the chips with the wine to the beer. Package the beer as you would a normal IPA.

(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.046 FG = 1.009
IBU = 33 SRM = 3 ABV = 4.6%

Warsteiner is a well-known German Pilsner. This light-colored lager has a more rounded, less crisp, malt profile compared to Bitburger. Treat your yeast well to reach the fairly low final gravity of this beer.

Ingredients
9 lbs. (4.1 kg) Pilsner malt
6 oz. (0.17 g) Carafoam® malt
7 AAU Magnum hops (60 min.) (0.5 oz./13 g at 14% alpha acids)
2 AAU Tettnang hops (15 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 4% alpha acids)
2 AAU Hallertau-Hersbrücker hops (15 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 4% alpha acids)
0.25 oz. (7 g) Hallertau-Hersbrücker hops (0 min.)
0.25 oz. (7 g) Saaz hops (0 min.)
1 tsp. Irish moss (15 min.)
Wyeast 2124 (Bohemian Lager) or White Labs WLP830 (German Lager) yeast (4 qt./4 L yeast starter)
7/8 cup (175 g) dextrose (if priming)

Step by Step
Use a step infusion mash with 15-minute rests at 131 °F (55 °C) and 140 °F (60 °C) and a 45 minute rest at 149 °F (65 °C). Mash out, vorlauf, and then sparge at 170 °F (77 °C) to collect enough wort to result in 5 gallons (19 L) after a 90-minute boil. Boil 90 minutes, adding hops at times indicated. After the boil is complete, allow the beer to sit covered for 15 minutes before cooling. After cooling, aerate and pitch yeast. Ferment at 55 °F (13 °C). Rack to secondary when fermentation is complete. Bottle or keg a few days later, when beer falls clear.

Extract with grains option:
Substitute the grains in the all-grain recipe with 1.4 lbs. (1.1 kg) Pilsen dried malt extract, 3.3 lbs. (1.5 kg) Pilsen liquid malt extract, and 0.25 lbs. (0.11 kg) Carafoam® malt. In a large soup pot, heat 3 quarts (3 L) of water to 167 °F (75 °C). Add crushed grains to grain bag. Submerge bag and let grains steep around 156 °F (69 °C) for 45 minutes. While grains steep, begin heating 2.4 gallons (9 L) of water in your brewpot. When steep is over, remove 1 qt. (1 L) of water from brewpot and add to the "grain tea" in steeping pot. Place colander over brewpot and place steeping bag in it. Pour grain tea (with water added) through grain bag. This will strain out any solid bits of grain and rinse some sugar from the grains. Heat liquid in brewpot to a boil, then stir in dried malt extract. Add hops as indicated and at flameout stir in the liquid malt extract until dissolved and let hot wort sit covered for 15 minutes before cooling. Top up to 5 gallons (19 L) and cool. Follow the remaining portion of the all-grain recipe.

Warszawski Porter Lodowy (Warsaw Baltic Porter)
Warszawski Porter Bałtycki (Warsaw Baltic Porter)
(5.25 gal/20 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.092 FG = 1.024
IBU = 64 SRM = 29 ABV = 9%

Ingredients
14.75 lbs. (6.7 kg) Pilsen malt
2.75 lbs. (1.3 kg) light Munich malt (6 °L)
1.5 lbs. (0.68 kg) Viking caramel 600 malt (600 EBC/225 °L)
14 AAU Marynka hop (beginning of boil) (1.4 oz./40 g at 10% alpha acids)
0.5 oz. (15 g) Marynka hop (0 min.)
Saflager W 34/70, or Wyeast XL 2278 (Czech Pils), or Fermentum Mobile FM31 (Bawarska dolina)
1/2 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Start by making sure your yeast count will be plenty. I used 3 satchets (33 g) of Saflager W 34/70 for pitching considering I wanted to ferment cold. If you plant to use liquid yeast, be sure to a big starter or repitch yeast cake from a session lager. Alternatively you could make a Baltic Porter like the early Polish Porter from the Royal Warsaw Brewery and use an ale yeast, which would require a lower pitch rate.

The original recipe makes use of lactic acid —for water with a pH of 6.2-6.8, use 8 ml. For water with a pH higher than 6.8 - 10 ml. Forewarning: Prepare for an extended wort preparation time due to decoction mash and long boiling time with hops — this should be taken into account when planning the brewing time. Suggested brewing pot capacity of at least 40 L (10 gal.). Be warned that many hours of boiling create huge amounts of steam so a very good ventilated room/kitchen is advisable.

There will be two mashes running concurrently. For mash I, add 1.9 kg (4.2 lbs.) Pilsner malt into 5–6 L (1.3–1.6 gal.) of water at 46 °C (115 °F). Keep the mash for 10 minutes at 45 °C (113 °F). Heat mash up to 52 °C (126 °F), add 1/3 of lactic acid and hold for 15 minutes. Heat up to 62 °C (144 °F) and allow a 15 minute rest. Heat up to 72 °C (162 °F) and hold to a negative iodine test (about 20 minutes). Heat up to boiling and boil for 20 minutes, stir so that the wort does not get burnt.

For mash II, add the remaining malts into 22 L (5.8 gal.) of water at 54 °C (130 °F). Add 2/3 of the lactic acid to the water. Keep the mash for 20 minutes at 52 °C (126 °F). Mix mash I with mash II. The temperature of the whole mash should stabilize at 62 °C (144 °F). If it is lower — heat up and provide a 20 minute break. Heat up to 68 °C (154 °F) and keep it for 15 minutes. Heat up to 72 °C (162°F) and hold to a negative iodine test. Heat up to 75.6 °C (168 °F). Sparge with 20 L (10.6 gal.) of water at 78 °C (172 °F).

Heat up the wort to boiling. Add 40 g (1.4 oz.) of Marynka and boil as long as it takes to obtain the desired 22 °Plato (1.092 SG). On our equipment it took 3 hours. After reaching desired sugar level, turn off the burner and add 15 g (0.53 oz.) of Marynka hops.

Make a whirlpool swirling the wort and let settle for 20 minutes, so the hot sediments and hops gather in the center of the pot. Chill the wort, then transfer the hopped wort to a fermentation vessel. Aerate the wort heavily.

This yeast is best added at a temperature of about 6 °C (43 °F), the temperature of yeast and wort should be similar. Primary fermentation should last at least 22 days at a temperature of 5—7 °C (41–45 °F). Transfer to a secondary vessel that should last about 14 days. also at 5—7 °C (41–45 °F). The final gravity should be around 5.5–6.5 °P (1.022–1.026 SG).

Bottle prime using about 5 g table sugar or glucose per liter of beer (0.7 oz. sugar/gal of beer). After carbonation has been achieved, store about a week at room temperature, and then store in a dark room at the lowest possible temperature (minimum 4 ºC/39 °F, optimally 8–12 ºC/46–54 °F). Lager for 3 months. Our experience with this recipe is that this beer could be enjoyed already after it gets carbonated — the absence of roasted barley or black malts in the grain bill makes it possible, but of course the longer lagering the better (12 months and on reveal more complexity).

Optional: For creating the iced porter (Warszawski Porter Lodowy) we used the beer right after secondary fermentation. We placed 10 L (2.5 gal.) of the porter outside at roughly -18 to -22 °C (0 to -8 °F) in order to freeze. You could use a freezer at roughly this temperature. Allow to sit at this temperature for 3 days, then rack of in order to bottle.

Watermelon Wheat
Watermelon Wheat
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.052 FG = 1.012
IBU = 13 SRM = 5 ABV = 5.0%

Ingredients
6.0 lbs. (2.7 kg) German wheat malt (light)
4.0 lbs. (1.8 kg) 2-row pale malt
0.5 lbs. (0.23 kg) Briess Carapils® malt
3.75 AAU Mt. Hood pellet hops (0.75 oz./21 g at 5% alpha acids)(60 min.)
White Labs WLP320 (American Hefeweizen Ale) yeast
6 C. watermelon juice (fresh squeezed, not pasteurized)
Less than 1 oz./watermelon extract to taste (at kegging)
3/4 cup corn sugar (if bottling)

Step by Step
Mash grains in 3.5 gallons (13 L) of water at 150 °F (66 °C) for 60 minutes. Sparge with 4.75 gallons (18 L) of 170 °F (77 °C) water. Boil the wort for 60 minutes. At the beginning of the boil, add 0.5 oz./14 g of Mt. Hood hops. I also add yeast nutrient at 15 minutes, but no Irish Moss in a wheat beer. When boil is done, chill to 65 °F (18 °C) and pitch yeast.

When your primary fermentation is complete, prepare your fresh watermelon. I use a sanitized steel bowl and potato masher to mash fresh watermelon and run the juice through a funnel with strainer. Collect 6 cups of juice and place in your secondary vessel. Rack your beer on top. The juice and (pink) beer will begin a vigorous secondary fermentation. When complete, it will leave cool pink and white melon/yeast rings in the bottom. The final beer will pour yellow with a slightly pink head. Rack to your keg or bottling bucket and taste. Add watermelon extract (less than an ounce) to taste. Bottle or keg your beer as usual.

(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.056 FG = 1.010
IBU = 32 SRM = 16 ABV = 6%

Samuel Smith’s Brewery holds the recipe for Winter Welcome — a beer first brewed over 30 years ago by retired Head Brewer Steve Barrett — close to the chest. This recipe for Weekend Welcome was created by Craig Hartinger, homebrewer and long-time employee of the importer of Sam Smith’s, Merchant du Vin, and is based on many years of Winter Welcome sampling and a little insider knowledge of the brewery. If not an exact clone, this recipe will get you most of the way there. Brew this recipe, then grab a bottle of Winter Welcome and compare.

Ingredients
9 lbs. (4.08 kg) English Maris Otter pale ale malt
1.5 lbs. (0.68 kg) crystal malt (80 °L)
1.13 lbs. (0.51 kg) crystal malt (20 °L)
7.5 AAU Fuggle whole leaf hops (60 min.) (1.15 oz./33 g at 6.5% alpha acids)
2.4 AAU Goldings whole leaf hops (5 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 4.75 % alpha acids)
Wyeast 1098 (British Ale) or White Labs WLP007 (Dry English Ale) or LalBrew Nottingham yeast
3⁄4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Using a fairly thick mash of 1 lb. of grain per 1 qt. of water, with calcium chloride additions to achieve at least 50 ppm calcium, mash for 45 minutes at 158 °F (70 °C) or until conversion is complete. Recirculate for about ten minutes to set the grain bed, then sparge with 5 gallons (19 L) of water at 170 °F (77 °C) and collect about 6.5 gallons (24.5 L) in your boil kettle. Boil for 60 minutes, adding the hops as indicated.

At flameout, rapidly chill the wort to 65 °F (18 °C) and pitch yeast, oxygenate thoroughly. Primary fermentation at 65 °F (18 °C) should complete in about four days, but let the beer sit for at least two weeks to fully absorb all fermentation byproducts. Rack beer and force carbonate to 2.1 volumes or prime and bottle condition.

Ingredients
5 lbs. (2.3 kg) extra light dried malt extract
1.5 lbs. (0.68 kg) crystal malt (80 °L)
1.13 lbs. (0.51 kg) crystal malt (20 °L)

Wyeast 1098 (British Ale) or White Labs WLP007 (Dry English Ale) or LalBrew Nottingham yeast
3⁄4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Using a 5-gallon (19-L) kettle, start by steeping only the crystal malt additions (placed in a muslin bag) in about 1 gallon (4 L) of water at 155 °F (68 °C) for 15 minutes. Remove grain bag then add more water to your boil kettle to bring it to 4 gallons (15 L). Once liquid is at or near boil, turn off the flame and slowly add half of the malt extract, stirring to avoid clumping or scorching. Adding just half of the extract at this time will help increase hop isomerization. Turn flame back on, bring to boil, and add bittering hops. With 15 minutes left in the boil, add the rest of the malt extract. At flameout, rapidly chill the wort to 65 °F (18 °C), top up to 5 gallons (19 L). Pitch yeast, oxygenate thoroughly. Primary fermentation at 65 °F (18 °C) should complete in about four days, but let the beer sit for at least two weeks to fully absorb all fermentation byproducts. Rack beer and force carbonate to 2.1 volumes or prime and bottle condition.

While I was going for a Weihenstephaner Hefe Weissbier clone with this beer, I found that using just wheat and Pilsner malt lacked the malt depth when compared to the original, even when I double decocted the mash. I added some dark Munich malt and melanoidin malt to try to coax a layer of complexity which the original German hefeweizen displays. I also adjusted the hops from a low alpha acid variety, Hallertau Mittelfrüh, to the higher alpha German Magnum to minimize extraction of polyphenols considering the longer contact time with the wort.

Ingredients
5.5 lbs. (2.5 kg) German wheat malt
4 lbs. (1.8 kg) continental Pilsner malt
12 oz. (0.34 kg) dark Munich malt (9 °L)
4 oz. (0.11 kg) melanoidin malt
Rice hulls (optional)
3 AAU Magnum hops (FWH) (0.25 oz./7 g at 14% alpha acid)
Wyeast 3068 (Weihenstephaner Weizen) or White Labs WLP300 (Hefeweizen Ale) or Lallemand Munich Classic Wheat yeast
Priming sugar (if bottling)

Step by Step
This is a step infusion mash. Dough-in the crushed grains to achieve a mash temperature of 112 °F (44 °C) for ferulic acid development. Let rest for 20 minutes then raise the mash temperature to 152 °F (67 °C) for saccharification conversion. Rest at this temperature for 45 minutes then begin lautering. If you are using rice hulls, add them prior to starting your lauter. Once you begin your run-off into your kettle add the hops. If you are fly sparging, be wary of the specific gravity — or more specifically the pH of your run-off. If your specific gravity drops below 1.010, shut down the sparge and top off the kettle. Collect 6 gallons (23 L) of wort and boil for 60 minutes. After knockout, begin a whirlpool and let the wort spin down for 10 minutes.
Chill the wort to 65 °F (18 °C), pitch an appropriate yeast starter (~1 qt./1 L) and aerate the wort thoroughly. Ferment at 68 °F (20 °C). Carbonate the beer to 3–3.5 volumes CO2. For carbonation guidelines, visit, https://byo.com/resources/carbonation

IBU = 50 SRM = 44 ABV = 4%

Black Perle is one of the first beers Weird Beard produced commercially and still forms part of their core range in bottles and traditional cask. It takes its name from German Perle with which it is single-hopped. It’s a sweet stout with a rich coffee backbone.

Ingredients
7.5 lbs. (3.4 kg) Maris Otter pale ale malt (2.8 °L)
1.1 lbs. (0.52 kg) caramel malt (120 °L)
0.7 lb. (0.32 kg) roasted barley (525 °L)
0.6 lb. (0.28 kg) flaked oats
0.5 lb. (0.22 kg) chocolate malt (330 °L)
0.2 lb. (0.1 kg) torrified wheat
0.2 lb. (0.1 kg) lactose sugar (30 min.)
0.4 lb. (0.2 kg) lactose sugar (15 min.)
5.6 AAU Perle hops (first wort hop) (0.7 oz./20 g at 8% alpha acids)
11.2 AAU Perle hops (20 min.) (1.4 oz./40 g at 8% alpha acids)
5.6 AAU Perle hops (5 min.) (0.7 oz./20 g at 8% alpha acids)
1⁄2 Whirlfloc tablet (10 min.)
0.8 oz. (23 g) roasted whole coffee beans (secondary)
Safale US-05 American Ale or Lallemand BRY-97 (American West Coast Ale) yeast
2⁄3 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Mill the grains and dough-in targeting a mash of around 1.2 quarts of strike water to 1 pound of grain (2.5 L/kg) and a temperature of 154 °F (68 °C). Hold the mash at 154 °F (68 °C) until enzymatic conversion is complete. Sparge slowly with 171 °F (77 °C) water, collecting wort until pre-boil kettle volume is 6 gallons (23 L). Add the first wort hops during the sparging process.

Total boil time is 60 minutes, adding the hops and the lactose sugar as indicated. Add Whirlfloc with 10 minutes left in the boil.

Chill the wort to 68 °F (20 °C) and aerate thoroughly. Pitch the yeast and let the temperature free rise to 72 °F (22 °C). When fermentation is two-thirds complete, let the temperature free rise again to 75 °F (24 °C). At approximately 2 points away from final gravity, add the coffee beans to the fermenter. Keep it at 75 °F (24 °C) for 2 days and then cool to 41 °F (5 °C) for around 5 days. Carbonate the beer to around 2.1 volumes of CO2 and allow time for the beer to condition fully.

0.2 lb. (0.1 kg) lactose sugar (30 min.)
0.4 lb. (0.2 kg) lactose sugar (15 min.)
5.6 AAU Perle hops (first wort hop) (0.7 oz./20 g at 8% alpha acids)
11.2 AAU Perle hops (20 min.) (1.4 oz./40 g at 8% alpha acids)
5.6 AAU Perle hops (5 min.) (0.7 oz./20 g at 8% alpha acids)
1⁄2 Whirlfloc tablet (10 min.)
0.8 oz. (23 g) roasted whole coffee beans (secondary)
Safale US-05 American Ale or Lallemand BRY-97 (American West Coast Ale) yeast
2⁄3 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Place crushed pale ale malt along with flaked oats and torrified wheat in a grain bag. Submerge the grains in 5 quarts of water that has been heated to 164 °F (73 °C). The mash should rest at a temperature of 154 °F (68 °C). Hold the mash at 154 °F (68 °C) for about 45 minutes then submerge in a second bag the remaining grains. Hold for 15 minutes. Remove both bags and wash with 1 gallon (4 L) hot water. Stir in the dried malt extract and top off with water to 6 gallons (23 L). Add the first wort hops.

Total boil time is 60 minutes, adding the hops and the lactose sugar as indicated. Add Whirlfloc with 10 minutes left in the boil.

Chill the wort to 68 °F (20 °C) and aerate thoroughly. Pitch the yeast and let the temperature free rise to 72 °F (22 °C). When fermentation is two-thirds complete, let the temperature free rise again to 75 °F (24 °C). At approximately 2 points away from final gravity, add the coffee beans to the fermenter. Keep it at 75 °F (24 °C) for 2 days and then cool to 41 °F (5 °C) for around 5 days. Carbonate the beer to around 2.1 volumes of CO2 and allow time for the beer to condition fully.

Weizen Trippelbock
Weizen Trippelbock
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.108 FG = 1.026
IBU = 35 SRM = 24 ABV = 10.8%

Inspired by The Livery’s Trippel Weizenbock. Steve Berthel told us that, "Most lagers do not use black patent, chocolate, or roast barley in the recipes. I favor a two-hour boil with dark crystal malts to achieve the raisiny, toffee flavors." The second attempt to dial in this recipe is used a 5-gallon (19-L) malt whisky barrel from Balcones Distillery in Texas.

Ingredients
7.5 lbs. (3.4 kg) German wheat malt
5.0 lbs. (2.3 kg) German dark Munich malt
5 lb. 2 oz. (2.3 kg) German Pilsner malt
4.0 lbs. (1.8 kg) German Vienna malt
1.25 lbs. (0.57 kg) Simpsons extra dark crystal malt (160 °L)
8 AAU Perle hops (75 min.) (1.1 oz./32 g of 7% alpha acids)
4 AAU Perle hops (20 min.) (0.57 oz./16 g of 7% alpha acids)
3 AAU Tettnang hops (10 min.) (0.86 oz./24 g of 3.5% alpha acids)
White Labs WLP833 (German Bock) or Wyeast 2487 (Hella Bock) yeast (18 qt./ 17 L yeast starter)
2/3 cup (150 g) dextrose (if priming)

Step By Step
Mash grain at 154 °F (68 °C) for 60 minutes. Boil wort for 120 minutes, adding hops as indicated.

Chill to 46 °F (8 °C). Oxygenate with pure oxygen for 90 seconds. Pitch a large starter of the yeast, or multiple vials to reach at least 600 billion cells. Ferment for 10 days keeping the temperature of the wort at 52 °F (11 °C). As fermentation slows, raise the temperature for a diacetyl rest to 66 °F (19 °C). When the final gravity is reached, and there is no perception of diacetyl, chill the wort to 32 °F (0 °C) for at least two months of lagering. If you want to barrel age the beer, do so before lagering. Carbonate to 2.2 volumes of CO2.

Weizen Trippelbock
(5 gallons/19 L, partial mash)
OG = 1.108 FG = 1.026
IBU = 35 SRM = 24 ABV = 10.8%

Ingredients
5.25 lbs. (2.4 kg) German wheat dried malt extract
5.0 lbs. (2.3 kg) Munich liquid malt extract (late addition)
4.0 lbs. (1.8 kg) German Vienna malt
1.25 lbs. (0.57 kg) Simpsons extra dark crystal malt (160 °L)
8 AAU Perle hops (75 min.) (1.1 oz./32 g of 7% alpha acids)
4 AAU Perle hops (20 min.) (0.57 oz./16 g of 7% alpha acids)
3 AAU Tettnang hops (10 min.) (0.86 oz./24 g of 3.5% alpha acids)
White Labs WLP833 (German Bock) or Wyeast 2487 (Hella Bock) yeast
2/3 cup (150 g) dextrose (if priming)

Step By Step
Mash Vienna malt at 154 °F (68 °C) for 60 minutes. Steep dark crystal malt in a separate pot for same time and temperature. Colect about 2.25 gallons (8.5 L) of wort from partial mash and combine with "grain tea" from crystal malt. Add dried malt extract and water to make at least 3.5 gallons (13 L). Boil wort for 120 minutes, adding hops as indicated. Keep some boiling water handy to keep boil topped up to at least 3.0 gallons (11 L). Stir in liquid malt extract in final 15 minutes of boil. Chill to 46 °F (8 °C) and transfer to fermenter. Top up to 5 gallons (19 L) with cold water and oxygenate with pure oxygen for 90 seconds. Pitch yeast, ferment and condition beer following the instructions in the all-grain recipe.

Tips for Success:
Your biggest key to success is pitching enough yeast. The all-grain recipes give an optimal yeast starter size for a yeast starter that is heavily aerated. (Consider brewing 5.0 gallons (19 L) of helles or other light lager as a yeast starter for the Weizen Trippelbock.) See the pitching rate calculator at www.mrmalty.com for other options to raise the appropriate amount of healthy cells. Without an adequate pitch, these beers will not ferment properly.

IBU = 20 ABV = 5%

Ingredients
3.75 lbs. (1.7 kg) Pilsener malt
3.75 lbs. (1.7 kg) red wheat malt
1 lb. (0.45 kg) flaked barley
1 lb. (0.45 kg) flaked red wheat
1.2 AAU Sterling hops (bittering) (0.18 oz. at 7% alpha acid)
2.5 AAU Sterling hops (flavor) (0.35 oz. at 7% alpha acid)
4.2 AAU Sterling hops (aroma) (0.60 oz. at 7% alpha acid)
0.5 oz. (14 g) coriander seed (0 min.)
1.25 oz. (35 g) fresh orange zest (0 min.)
Wyeast 1056 (American Ale) or White Labs WLP001 (California Ale) or Safale US-05 yeast
0.75 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
You want to mash this beer with a water ratio of 1.25 quarts of water per pound of grain (2.6 L/kg). Mash at 152 °F (67 °C) for 90 minutes. It should still attenuate very well, even with a higher mash temperature than the Kiwanda Cream Ale.

Boil the wort for 90 minutes. Boil the first hop addition for the last 60 minutes; boil the next hops for the last 30 minutes. Add the final hops, coriander and orange at knock-out. Give the wort a long stir to create a whirlpool and let settle for 15 minutes.

Cool the wort, aerate and pitch yeast. Ferment at 68 °F (20 °C) for one week, then rack to secondary. Bottle after one week with three-quarters cup of corn sugar.

Not all late-hopped beers need to be aggressive. Pelican Brewing Co. from Cannon Beach, Oregon created the first modern beer recipe I heard about in which the first hopping addition was after flameout. This is the perfect summer beer to enjoy on the water.

Ingredients
9 lbs. (4.1 kg) 2-row pale malt
13 oz. (370 g) dextrin malt
8 oz. (230 g) flaked barley
10 AAU Mt Hood hops (0 min.) (2 oz./57 g at 5% alpha acid)
Wyeast 1056 (American Ale) or White Labs WLP001 (California Ale) or Safale US-05 yeast
3⁄4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step

Mill the grains and mix with 15.5 qts. (14.6 L) of 162 °F (72 °C) strike water to reach a mash temperature of 150 °F (66 °C). Hold this temperature for 90 minutes. Vorlauf until your runnings are clear. Sparge with enough water to obtain 6.5 gallons (24.6 L) of wort. Boil for 60 minutes. After the boil, turn off heat and begin a whirlpool of the hot wort. Add the hops while whirlpooling. Let stand for 20 minutes, then chill the wort to 65 °F (18 °C). Aerate with pure oxygen or filtered air and pitch yeast.

Ferment at 65 °F (18 °C) for 7 days. Raise to 70 °F (21 °C) for three more days. Once the beer reaches terminal gravity, bottle or keg and carbonate to approximately 2.5 volumes. You can cold-crash the beer prior to packaging to 35 °F (2 °C) for 48 hours to improve clarity.

Pelican Brewing Co.’s Kiwanda Cream Ale clone
(5 gallons/19 L, partial mash)
OG = 1.049 FG = 1.007
IBU = 25 SRM = 4 ABV = 5.4%

Ingredients
4.25 lbs. (2 kg) extra light dried malt extract
1 lb. (0.45 kg) 2-row pale malt
13 oz. (370 g) dextrin malt
8 oz. (230 g) flaked barley
10 AAU Mt Hood hops (0 min.) (2 oz./57 g at 5% alpha acid)
Wyeast 1056 (American Ale) or White Labs WLP001 (California Ale) or Safale US-05 yeast
3⁄4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step

Bring 1 gallon (4 L) of water to approximately 160 °F (71 °C). Submerge the milled grains in grain bags and steep for 45 minutes, trying to maintain the temperature at about 150 °F (66 °C). Remove the grain bags, and place in a colander. Wash the grains with 1 gallon (4 L) hot water. Add the dried malt extract while stirring, and stir until dissolved, then top off to 5 gallons (19 L). Boil for 30 minutes. After the boil, turn off heat and begin a whirlpool of the hot wort. Add the hops while whirlpooling. Let stand for 20 minutes, then chill the wort to 65 °F (18 °C) and transfer wort

to the fermenter. Top off the fermenter to 5 gallons (19 L), then aerate with pure oxygen or filtered air and pitch yeast.

Ferment at 65 °F (18 °C) for 7 days. Raise to 70 °F (21 °C) for three more days. Once the beer reaches terminal gravity, bottle or keg and carbonate to approximately 2.5 volumes. Cold-crash prior to packaging to 35 °F (2 °C) for 48 hours to improve clarity.

Backstory:

As Brewmaster Darron Welch explains it, "The reason Kiwanda is a whirlpool-only beer has to do with the early process of developing this beer. Initially, the beer had a more conventional formula, although still heavily weighted towards finishing hops for emphasis on hop aroma character rather than bitterness. Early batches hit the aroma targets but seemed too bitter from sensory work. Since Pelican has used outside lab services almost from the beginning of our operations, I sent samples off and confirmed that the beer was too bitter for the designed target specification.

"Wanting to keep the aromatic presence of the beer intact, I started gradually reducing the base bittering addition and the mid-kettle addition incrementally, getting laboratory feedback all along the way. It got to the point where my adjustments of kettle hops were having basically no impact on perceived or measured bitterness, so I simply abandoned them entirely. Subsequent testing showed that by eliminating all kettle hops and doing only the whirlpool addition, I not only hit the measured IBU specification, but more importantly, I was getting the balance of flavor, aroma, and bitterness that I had imagined when designing the beer in the first place.

"Hops added partway through the boil — 15–30 minutes of boil time — will tend to give more bitterness than might be traditionally expected, and not as much aroma as with a whirlpool addition. Part of it has to do with the overall design of the beer and the formulation."

After the boil, turn off heat and whirlpool for 15 minutes, adding the coconut (loose-pack) in a mesh bag. After the whirlpool, remove the bag and let it drain into the wort. Chill the wort to slightly below fermentation temperature, about 65 °F (18 °C). Aerate the wort with pure oxygen or filtered air and pitch yeast.

Ferment at 68 °F (20 °C) for 7 days, then drop the temperature to 60 °F (16 °C) for 24 hours. Add the cocoa nibs, almonds, and vanilla beans, and age for 5-7 days. Crash the beer to 35 °F (2 °C) for 48 hours, and bottle or keg the beer and carbonate to approximately 2.25 volumes.

Tips for Success:
After a number of attempts, the brewers at Westbrook Brewing Co. (Mount Pleasant, South Carolina) found that nothing beats toasted coconut for the most/best coconut flavor. Head Cellarman Josh Weaver also notes that they use vodka to sanitize the secondary ingredient additions and simply add the complete tincture to the beer, preserving as much of the flavors extracted as possible!

Step by Step

Mill the grains and dough-in targeting a mash of around 1.5 quarts of water to 1 pound of grain (a liquor-to-grist ratio of about 3:1 by weight) and a temperature of 152°F (67 °C). Hold the mash at 152 °F (67 °C) until enzymatic conversion is complete. Infuse the mash with near boiling water while stirring or with a recirculating mash system raise the temperature to mash out at 168 °F (76 °C). Sparge slowly with 170 °F (77 °C) water, collecting wort until the pre-boil kettle volume is around 6.5 gallons (25 L) and the gravity is 1.052 (12.9 °P).

The total wort boil time is 90 minutes. Add the bittering hops with 60 minutes remaining in the boil. Add Irish moss or other kettle finings with 15 minutes left in the boil. Add other hop additions at 10 minutes remaining and flame out. Chill the wort to 67 °F (19 °C) and aerate thoroughly. The proper pitch rate is 12 grams of rehydrated dry yeast, 2 packages of liquid yeast or 1 package of liquid yeast in a 2.5-liter starter.

Ferment at 67 °F (19 °C) until the yeast drops clear. Fermentation should be complete in about one week. Allow the lees to settle and the brew to mature without pressure for another two days after fermentation appears finished. Rack to a keg and force carbonate or rack to a bottling bucket, add priming sugar, and bottle. Target a carbonation level of 2 to 2.5 volumes.

Step by Step
Mill or coarsely crack the specialty malts. Mix well and place loosely in a grain bag. Avoid packing the grains too tightly. Steep the bag in about 2 gallons (~8 liters) of water at roughly 170 °F (77 °C) for about 30 minutes. Lift the grain bag out of the steeping liquid and rinse with warm water. Allow the bags to drip into the kettle without squeezing for a few minutes while you add the malt extract. Add water to the steeping liquor and malt extract to make 5.9 gallons (22.3 liters) and a gravity of 1.056 (13.7 °P). Stir thoroughly and bring to a boil.

Once the wort is boiling, add the bittering hops. Total wort boil time is 1 hour after adding the bittering hops. During that time add the Irish moss or other kettle finings at 15 minutes before shut-down. Add other hop additions at 10 minutes remaining and flame out. Chill the wort to 67 °F (19 °C) and aerate thoroughly. The proper pitch rate is 11 grams of rehydrated dry yeast, 2 packages of liquid yeast or 1 package of liquid yeast in a 2.5-liter starter. Follow fermentation and packaging instructions for the all-grain version.

3⁄4 cup corn sugar if priming

Step by Step
Be sure to make an appropriate-sized yeast starter a day or two prior to brew day if using liquid yeast. If using dried yeast, pitch two sachets of yeast. Due to the large partial mash, be sure to use an appropriately-sized pot/cooler. At a minimum you will need about 2.5 gallons (10 L) of space for the mash.

Place crushed and flaked grains in a large mesh grain bag. Mash grains in 2 gallons (7.8 L) of water at 148 °F (64 °C) for 60 minutes. When conversion is complete, remove the grains and if possible wash with 2 gallons (7.8 L) of hot water. Top kettle off to 6 gallons (23 L) and bring to a boil. Remove kettle from heat and stir in the dried malt extract. Once all the extract is dissolved, bring wort back to a boil. Boil for 60 minutes, adding hops as indicated. Cool to 70 °F (21°C) to pitch yeast, then gradually cool to 50–60 °F (10–16 °C) for primary and secondary. Apply a 24–48 hour diacetyl rest at 70 °F (21°C) prior to lagering.

(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.057 FG = 1.002–1.012
IBU = 11 SRM = 13 ABV = 6.5%

Ingredients
5 lbs. 5 oz. (2.4 kg) Vienna malt
2 lbs. 8 oz. (1.1 kg) Pils malt
15 oz. (0.43 kg) aromatic malt
15 oz. (0.43 kg) Belgian Caravienne malt
2 lbs. 2 oz. (0.96 kg) raw wheat
5.0 oz. (0.14 kg) special B malt
3 AAU Hallertau hops (60 mins) (0.75 oz./21 g of 4.0% alpha acids)
2.0 oz. (57 g) oak cubes (medium toast)
Wyeast 3763 (Roeselare Blend) or White Labs WLP655 (Belgian Sour Mix)

Step by Step
Use 1.33 quarts of water perpound of grain (2.8 L/kg). Dough-in 90% of the malted grains to hit 122 °F (50 °C), and hold for 20 minutes. Mash the unmalted wheat and remaining 10% of the malted grain at 145 °F (63 °C) and hold for 15 minutes, then add the adjunct mash to the main mash. Traditionally, brewers use a multi-step mash schedule:

Raise to 145 °F (63 °C) and hold for 40 minutes, then raise to 162 °F (72 °C) and hold for 30 minutes. Recently, I've been experimenting with a single step of about 158 °F (70 °C), to promote the formation of "unfermentable sugar" to make the yeast and bacteria work a little harder. Raise to 169 °F (76 °C), and hold for 10 minutes. When finished, sparge with 176 °F (80 °C) water.

Boil for 2 hours at a rolling boil. Cool the beer to 70 °F (21 °C) and pitch it with your yeast blend into a carboy. The Roeselare culture is a complete blend of all of the yeasts and bacteria necessary for fermentation. Ferment at 70 °F (21 °C). Once visible signs of fermentation have finished, rack with the equivalent of 2.0 oz. (57 g) of oak cubes for 5 gallons (19 L) into a second carboy.

Put it in a corner at ambient temperature and wait (and wait). With time, a thin white film (pellicle) will form on the top of the beer. Eventually, you will sample the beer and determine that it is ready. Bottle with new yeast and your desired amount of priming sugar. As always, save me a bottle.

Brouwerij Westmalle, Malle
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.081  FG = 1.015
IBU = 39  SRM = 5  ABV = 8.5%

Our Lady of the Beloved Sacred Heart at Westmalle was founded in the wake of the French Revolution, in 1794, by Royalist monks fleeing the guillotine. They began brewing in the 1830s and the brewery became more commercial in the early years of the 20th century. The Westmalle beers are bottled in a custom-designed, raised-letter brown bottle. They’re served at cellar temperatures in a typical stemmed, wide-mouthed goblet, with a row of dimples around the base of the bowl.

Ingredients
12.75 lbs. (5.8 kg) Pilsner malt
2 lbs. (0.91 kg) cane sugar or clear Belgian (rock) candi sugar
9.5 AAU Styrian Goldings hops (60 min.) (1.9 oz./53 g at 5% alpha acid)
3 AAU Tettnang hops (15 min.) (0.75 oz./21 kg at 4% alpha acid)
3 AAU Saaz hops (5 min.) (0.75 oz./21 kg at 4% alpha acid)
White Labs WLP530 (Abbey Ale) or Wyeast 3787 (Trappist Style High Gravity) yeast (1 qt./~1 L yeast starter)
1.2 cups (240 g) dextrose (if priming)

Step by Step
Crush your grains and mash in at 131 °F (55 °C), stirring the grains into 4 gallons (15 L) of water at around 142 °F (61 ºC), then ramp the mash temperature to 148 °F (64 °C), stirring as you heat. Quickly boost mash temperature to 168 °F (76 °C) before transferring wort to your lauter tun. Ramp time (from 131–148 °F/55–64 °C) should take at least an hour; longer times (up to several hours) will give more fermentable worts and drier, more alcoholic beers. (Westmalle Tripel’s apparent attenuation is 88%, giving it 9.6% ABV.) Collect about 7 gallons (26 L) of wort and boil for roughly 2 hours total (until you reach 5 gallons/19 L) Make hop additions as directed in ingredient list. Add sugar at least 15 minutes before end of boil. Cool wort and transfer to fermenter. Top up to 5 gallons (19 L) aerate well and pitch yeast. Ferment at 68 °F (20 ºC). Be prepared for final stages of fermentation to proceed slowly. Don’t rush, get your beer into bottles, prime with sugar, bottle and age eight to 10 weeks. Will improve with more aging, up to about a year. Serve at 50 °F (10 ºC) in a wide-mouthed, stemmed chalice.

Extract with grains option:
Reduce the 2-row pale malt in the all-grain recipe to 2 lbs. (0.91 kg) and add 3 lbs. (1.4 kg) light dried malt extract and 3.9 lbs. (1.8 kg) light liquid malt extract. Heat 3 qts. (~3 L) water to 161 °F (72 ºC). Crush Pilsner malt and add to liquor. Steep at 150 °F (66 °C) for 45 minutes. Rinse grains with 1.5 qts. (~1.5 L) of water at 170 °F (77 ºC). Add water to "grain tea" to make 3 gallons (11 L), add dried malt extract and sugar, stir well and bring to a boil. Boil for 60 minutes, adding hops as directed in ingredient list. Stir in liquid malt extract with 15 minutes left in the boil. Follow the remaining portion of the all-grain recipe.

OG = 1.080 FG = 1.019
IBU = 21 SRM = 13 ABV = 8%

This hearty, full-bodied, spicy pumpkin ale is rich with cinnamon, nutmeg, cardamom, and clove.

Ingredients
7.6 lbs. (3.5 kg) Muntons pale ale malt (2.5 °L)
5.25 lbs. (2.4 kg) Weyermann Vienna malt (3.5 °L)
1.8 lbs. (0.8 kg) Weyermann Munich I malt (6 °L)
1.8 lbs. (0.8 kg) Weyermann CaraMunich® II (45 °L)
0.9 lbs. (0.4 kg) Weyermann CaraFoam® (2 °L)
6.3 AAU Apollo hop pellets (60 min.) (0.35 oz./10 g at 18% alpha acids)
1.6 lbs. (0.7 kg) pumpkin puree (10 min.)
0.38 oz. (10.6 g) Vietnamese ground cinnamon (2 min.)
0.2 oz. (5.7 g) ground nutmeg (2 min.)
1 pinch ground cardamom (2 min.)
1 pinch ground clove (2 min.)
Wyeast 1272 (American Ale II) or White Labs WLP051 (California Ale V) or Lallemand Nottingham ale yeast
¾ cup (150 g) dextrose (if priming)

Step by Step
Heat 5.5 gallons (20.5 L) of strike water to achieve a stable mash temperature of 144 °F (62 °C). Hold at this temperature until starch conversion is complete, which is at least 60 minutes. Check for complete conversion using an iodine test before beginning the sparge phase. Collect 6 gallons (23 L) of wort in the kettle and boil for 60 minutes adding hops at the beginning of the boil. Add the spices with 2 minutes left in the boil. The pumpkin puree is added directly into the kettle to avoid the stuck mash issue. This means that the yield will be affected downstream as more beer will be lost at each transfer point. Weyerbacher reports that they lose a significant amount of wort in the fermenter. Be careful not to add too much of either the cardamom or the clove as they can easily overwhelm the beer. After the boil, give the wort a stir for at least a minute and let the hot wort settle for 15 minutes total. Chill to 68 °F (20 °C) and maintain this temperature during active fermentation. If you can, ramp the temperature up to 72 °F (22 °C) at the end of active fermentation to assure completion. Bottle or keg as usual.

Extract with grains option:
Substitute the pale, Vienna, and Munich I malts in the all-grain recipe with 9.5 lbs. (4.3 kg) Munich liquid malt extract. Heat 1 gallon (3.8 L) of water to 170 °F (77 °C) and place the crushed grains in a brewing bag. Soak the grains for 20 minutes at 160 °F (71 °C), then rinse the grains with 1 gallon (3.8 L) of hot water. Do not squeeze the bag — let it drip into the kettle. Add water to make 6 gallons (23 L) of wort in the kettle and add the liquid malt extract off the heat. Stir until all the extract has dissolved. Bring the wort to a boil for 60 minutes. Follow the remaining portion of the all-grain recipe.

(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.096 FG = 1.015
IBU = 30 SRM = 31 ABV = 11.6%

Ingredients
13.5 lbs. (6.12 kg) Pilsner malt
2 lbs. (0.91 kg) wheat malt
6 oz. (0.17 kg) crystal malt (40 °L)
6 oz. (0.17 kg) Special B® malt (130 °L)
1.25 lbs. (0.57 kg) dark Belgian candi sugar (15 min.)
12 oz. (0.34 kg) cane sugar (15 min.)
7.2 AAU Apollo hops (90 min.) (0.4 oz./11 g at 18% alpha acids)
1 oz. (28 g) Bramling Cross hops (0 min.)
1⁄2 tsp. yeast nutrient (15 min.)
0.1 oz. (3 g) ground star anise (15 min.)
0.25 oz. (7 g) ground coriander (2 min.)
White Labs WLP540 (Abbey IV Ale) or Wyeast 1762 (Belgian Abbey II) yeast
Wyeast 1214 (Belgian Abbey) yeast (if a re-pitch is needed, or if priming)
7⁄8 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Mill the grains and mix with 5.1 gallons (19.3 L) of 161 °F (72 °C) strike water to reach a mash temperature of 149 °F (65 °C). Hold at this temperature for 60 minutes. Mash out at 172 °F (77 °C). Vorlauf until the runnings are clear. Sparge the grains until you collect 6.5 gallons (24.6 L) of wort at approximately 1.061 specific gravity in your boil kettle. Boil for 90 minutes adding hops, yeast nutrient, sugar, and spices according to the ingredients list.

After the boil, turn off the heat and add the 0-minute hop addition according to the ingredients list. Whirlpool the kettle by gently stirring with a mash paddle for 2 minutes and then let rest for an additional 8 minutes. Next, chill the wort to 70 °F (21 °C) and transfer into a clean and sanitized fermenter. Aerate the wort with pure oxygen for 90 seconds and pitch yeast cells. The recommended pitch rate is 324 billion yeast, so it is highly recommended that you make a large starter or pitch a slurry from a smaller beer (see Tips for Success).

Ferment for three days at 70 °F (21 °C), then let the temperature rise up to about 75 °F (24 °C) to finish the remainder of primary fermentation. Rack to a secondary vessel and allow the beer to condition for an additional 2–4 weeks. Prime and bottle, or carbonate to 2.7 volumes of CO2, keg, and enjoy!

Step by Step
Place the two varieties of crushed crystal malts in a grain bag, then add the grain bag to 2 gallons (7.57 L) of 150 °F (66 °C). Allow grain bag (which will float) to steep for 20–30 minutes while you continue to heat the water up to no hotter than 170 °F (77 °C) in order to avoid extracting tannins. Next, remove the grain bag and top your kettle up with enough pre-heated water to reach a total pre-boil volume of 6.5 gallons (24.6 L). Once you reach a boil, remove the pot from the heat and add the malt extract. Turn the heat source back on and boil for90 minutes adding hops, yeast nutrient, sugar, and spices according to the ingredients list.

After the boil, turn off the heat and add the 0 min. hop addition. Whirlpool the kettle by gently stirring with a mash paddle for 2 minutes and then let rest for an additional 8 minutes. Next, chill the wort to 70 °F (21 °C) and transfer into a clean and sanitized fermenter. Aerate the wort with pure oxygen for 90 seconds and pitch yeast. The recommended pitch rate is 324 billion yeast cells, so it is highly recommended that you make a large starter or pitch a slurry from a smaller beer (see Tips for Success).

Ferment for three days at 70 °F (21 °C), then let the temperature rise up to about 75 °F (24 °C) to finish the remainder of primary fermentation. Rack to a secondary vessel and allow the beer to condition for an additional 2–4 weeks. Prime and bottle, or carbonate to 2.7 volumes of CO2, keg, and enjoy!

Tips for Success:
Due to the high original gravity of this beer, pitching the proper amount of yeast is key. Brewmaster Chris Wilson urges brewers that, "You need lots of healthy vigorous yeast!" There are a couple of ways to do this. First would be to make a large starter about a week prior to brew day, then cold-crash the starter and decant it off the liquid prior to pitching the yeast. If you’re using a stir plate, that would mean about 2.25-L starter. If you’re not using a stir plate, a better option would be to brew up a smaller (low gravity) beer first and use the yeast slurry from that fermenter to re-pitch into this beer. This should allow the yeast to properly attenuate your 20th Anniversary clone. Even if you do everything correct, Chris Wilson says that, "the yeast proved to be a bit finicky and pooped out on each batch at about 1.030 SG. We had to repitch to get it restarted on each occasion. It was still fermenting slowly and might have eventually done the job. Repitching did the job for us."

In regards to the spices, make sure that you err on the side of caution and use less rather than more. Chris Wilson says, "We wanted the spice to complement the ester profile of the Rochefort yeast. We were looking for a background flavor that most people would be unable to pick out."

Weyerbacher Brewing Co.'s Tiny clone
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.090 (brew day)
FG = 1.024 IBU = 50 SRM = 50 ABV = 11.8%

Tiny, a Belgian-style imperial stout, embodies Weyerbacher’s philosophy of big, bold beers with a flavorful twist. While the craft beer world has largely gravitated toward stouts fermented with a clean-fermenting American ale yeast, leaving a window open for expressive adjunct ingredients, Tiny relies on the fruity esters of a Belgian yeast strain for its nuance. The result is a smoother, fruitier imperial stout that lacks astringency but still packs a big punch of flavor, with rounded stone-fruit and chocolate notes conjured by fermentation and a careful selection of dark malts. Perfecting this recipe will remind brewers how much can be achieved by simply respecting the power of yeast itself.

Ingredients
14.5 lbs. (6.6 kg) 2-row malt
2 lbs. (0.9 kg) white wheat malt
1 lb. (0.45 kg) chocolate malt
12 oz. (0.34 kg) crystal malt (120 °L)
12 oz. (0.34 kg) Briess Blackprinz® malt (or Carafa® Special III) malt
2.5 lbs. (1.13 kg) table sugar (sucrose)
16 AAU Apollo hops (90 min.) (1 oz./28 g at 16% alpha acids)
LalBrew Abbaye, SafAle BE-256, or Wyeast 1762 (Belgian Abbey Style Ale II) yeast
3⁄4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by step
Mash at 154 °F (68 °C) for 60 minutes with a thick mash, 1–1.15 qts./lb. (2.1–2.4 L/kg). Begin lautering process and sparge with 180 °F (82 °C) water. Collect approximately 7 gallons (26.5 L) of wort in the brew kettle.

Boil for 90 minutes adding the hops at the beginning of the boil. Adjusting water volumes accordingly to achieve desired fermentation volume and chill wort. Your target starting gravity on brew day should be about 1.090. Begin fermentation around 65 °F (18 °C), then raise temperature to 70 °F (21 °C) after three days. Add the table sugar just as fermentation begins to slow, around day 3 or 4. Final ABV listed for this recipe accounts for this sugar addition. After fermentation is complete, let settle for one week then transfer the beer off the yeast. Cold condition for one month between 32–40 °F (0–4 °C). Bottle and prime to 2.5 volumes or keg and force carbonate.

What Gose Around
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1051 FG = 1.010
IBU = 7 SRM = 4 ABV = 5.3%

Ingredients
5 lbs. (2.3 kg) white wheat malt
3.5 lbs. (1.6 kg) Pilsner malt
2 lbs. (0.91 kg) acidulated malt
8 oz. (0.23 kg) rice hulls
2 AAU Hallertauer hops (60 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 4% alpha acids)
1 oz. (28 g) coriander seed (fresh cracked) (10 min.)
0.5 oz. (14 g) kosher salt (10 min.)
5.5 g calcium chloride
1 Whirlfloc tablet (15 min.)
GigaYeast GB150 (Sour Cherry Funk) blend
3⁄4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
This is a single-step infusion mash. Mill the grains, then mix with the calcium chloride and 15.75 qts. (14.9 L) of 162 °F (72 °C) strike water to reach a mash temperature of 148 °F (64 °C). Hold this temperature for 60 minutes. Raise the mash temperature through infusion of boiling water or recirculating system up to mash out at 168 °F (76 °C). Hold this temperature for 5 minutes, then begin vorlauf. Sparge the grains with enough water to obtain 6.5 gallons (24.6 L) of wort. Boil for 60 minutes, adding hops at the beginning of the boil. After the boil, whirlpool for 5 minutes, then let settle for 5 minutes. Chill the wort to about 65 °F (18 °C) and then pitch mixed culture.

Once fermentation commences, allow beer to free rise up to 67 °F (20 °C). You can hold this temperature for 14 days or until the completion of primary fermentation. If more acidity is desired, rack into secondary and age up to 3 months. Bottle or keg the beer and carbonate to approximately 2.5 volumes.

Extract option:
Replace all of the malts and the rice hulls in the all-grain version with 3 lbs. (1.4 kg) wheat dried malt extract, 2.5 lbs. (1.13 kg) Pilsner dried malt extract, and 1.5 tbs. 88% lactic acid. Heat 6.5 gallons (24.5 L) of water in the brew kettle to 158 °F (70 °C). Add the dried malt extracts and lactic acid, then stir thoroughly to dissolve completely. Turn the heat back on and bring to a boil. Boil the wort for 60 minutes, adding hops at the beginning of the boil. The remainder of this recipe is the same as the all-grain version.

Wheat Beer Two Ways
Wheat Beer Two Ways – American Wheat Beer & German Weissbier
(6 gallons/23 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.051 FG = 1.011–1.1014
IBU = 15 SRM = 4 ABV = 5.3%

You’ll be brewing one batch but need two fermenters as you’ll be pitching two different yeasts. The American wheat will use an American ale yeast like SafAle US-05, where the weissbier will require a German wheat strain like Mangrove Jack’s M20.

Ingredients
5.5 lbs. (2.5 kg) Pilsner malt
7 lbs. (3.2 kg) light wheat malt
4 oz. (113 grams) rice hulls (optional, but recommended)
3.5 AAU Perle hops (30 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 7% alpha acids)
1 oz. (28 g) Cascade hops (0 min.)
1 tsp. yeast nutrient (5 min.)
Clean American ale strain like SafAle US-05 yeast
Banana/clove weiss strain like Mangrove Jack’s M20 yeast
6 oz. corn sugar (3 oz. per fermenter, if priming)

Step by Step
Mill the grains and dough-in, targeting a mash of around 1.5 quarts of water per pound of grain (3.1 L/kg) and a temperature of 153 °F (68 °C). Hold the mash at 153 °F (68 °C) for 60 minutes. Sparge based on your system, but with enough water to yield a volume of 6 gallons (23 L) of post-boil wort, following a 30-minute boil.

Bring to a boil and add the hops and yeast nutrient as indicated. After the boil, add the Cascade hops and give the wort a long stir. Let settle for 10 minutes then chill the wort to 70 °F (21 °C) and transfer the wort evenly distributed between two sanitized 5-gallon (19-L) fermenters.

Pitch a full package of yeast into each fermenter and ferment both at 70 °F (21 °C) until activity has ceased. The fermenters may finish at different gravities. If bottling, dissolve priming sugar in ¾ cup water and add evenly to both fermenters just prior to bottling for natural carbonation. If force carbonating in a keg, target 2.5 volumes CO2.

Extract option:
The recipe can be brewed with just extract quite easily, completely skipping the mash. Replace the Pilsner and wheat malts with 7 lbs. (3.2 kg) of Bavarian wheat dried malt extract (DME). Add 3.5 lbs. (1.6 kg) of DME to a kettle filled with 3 gallons (11.5 L) of warm water. Bring to a boil adding hops and nutrient as per the schedule. Just before the end of the boil stir in an additional 3.5 lbs. (1.6 kg) of DME along with the Cascade hops. Stir to create a whirlpool and let settle for 10 minutes. Cool, and evenly divide wort into two separate 5-gallon (19-L) fermenters. Top up fermenters with water so both contain 3 gallons (11.5 L) wort. Continue to ferment and carbonate based on the all-grain instructions.

Notes:
You’ll notice the German weissbier style has little to no hop character, with almost all of the flavors being driven by the yeast esters and phenols, combined with some wheat malt character. You may get little to no hop aroma, which will be obstructed by the yeast.

With the American wheat style, you’ll notice more hop aroma, more distinctive grain-derived wheat flavors, possibly even a bit bready, and a much cleaner finish with few phenols and esters.

You can run similar tests and change other variables. Using one strain of yeast, pitch into two fermenters and ferment one at the high end of its fermentation range, and one at the low end. These types of experiments will improve your understanding of how yeast and fermentation environment variables affect beer flavors.

Wheat IPA
Wheat IPA
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.068 FG = 1.013
IBU = 94 SRM = 6 ABV = 7.2%

Ingredients
13.2 lbs. (6 kg) white wheat malt (2 °L)
8.8 oz (250 g) biscuit malt (25 °L)
21.25 AAU Columbus pellet hops (60 min.) (1.25 oz./35 g at 17% alpha acids)
1 oz. (28 g) Centennial pellet hops at 10% alpha acids (0 min.)
2 oz. (57 g) Cascade pellet hops at 6% alpha acids (0 min.)
1 oz. (28 g) Centennial pellet hops at 10% alpha acids (dry hop)
2 oz. (57 g) Cascade pellet hops at 6% alpha acids (dry hop)
White Labs WLP001 (California Ale) or Wyeast 1056 (American Ale) or Safale US-05 yeast

Step by Step
My current wheat malt comes from Briess and the biscuit malt from Dingemans. Feel free to substitute any high quality malt of a similar flavor and color from a different supplier. My hops are in pellet form and come from Hop Union, Hopsteiner, or Crosby Hop Farm depending on the variety.

Mill the grains and dough-in targeting a mash of around 1.5 quarts of water to 1 pound of grain (a liquor-to-grist ratio of about 3:1 by weight) and a temperature of 149 °F (65 °C). Hold the mash at 149 °F (65 °C) until enzymatic conversion is complete. Infuse the mash with near boiling water while stirring or, with a recirculating mash system, raise the temperature to mash out at 168 °F (76 °C). Sparge slowly with 170 °F (77 °C) water, collecting wort until the pre-boil kettle volume is around 6.5 gallons (25 L) and the gravity is 1.053.

The total wort boil time is 90 minutes. The first hop addition comes with 60 minutes remaining in the boil. Add Irish moss or other kettle finings with 15 minutes left in the boil. Add the second hop additions at flame out. Chill the wort to 67 °F (19 °C) and aerate thoroughly. The proper pitch rate is 2 packages of liquid yeast or 1 package of liquid yeast in a 2.7-liter (~0.75 gallon) starter.

Ferment at 67 °F (19 °C) until the yeast drops clear. At this temperature and with healthy yeast, fermentation should be complete in about one week. Allow the lees to settle and add the dry hops. You can first transfer the beer to a second vessel, if you prefer, but the dry hopping should be carried out around 60-65 °F (16-18 °C) for about a week. Then rack to a keg and force carbonate or rack to a bottling bucket, add priming sugar, and bottle. Target a carbonation level of 2.5 volumes.

Wheat IPA
(5 gallons/19 L, extract only)
OG = 1.065 FG = 1.015
IBU = 96 SRM = 6 ABV = 6.7%

Ingredients
8.8 lbs. (4 kg) wheat liquid malt extract (4 °L)
21.25 AAU Columbus pellet hops (60 min.) (1.25 oz./35 g at 17% alpha acids)
1 oz. (28 g) Centennial pellet hops at 10% alpha acids (0 min.)
2 oz. (57 g) Cascade pellet hops at 6% alpha acids (0 min.)
1 oz. (28 g) Centennial pellet hops at 10% alpha acids (dry hop)
2 oz. (57 g) Cascade pellet hops at 6% alpha acids (dry hop)
White Labs WLP001 (California Ale) or Wyeast 1056 (American Ale)

Step by Step
For most extract beers, I use extract made by Alexander's (California Concentrate Company), but any fresh, high quality light color extract will work well. Always choose the freshest extract that fits the beer style. If you cannot get fresh liquid malt extract, it is better to use an appropriate amount of dry malt extract instead. My hops are in pellet form and come from Hop Union, Hopsteiner, or Crosby Hop Farm depending on the variety.

Mix enough water with the malt extract to make a pre-boil volume of 5.9 gallons (22.3 L) and a gravity of 1.055. Stir thoroughly to help dissolve the extract and bring to a boil.

The total wort boil time is 60 minutes. Add the first hop addition once the wort starts boiling. Add Irish moss or other kettle finings with 15 minutes left in the boil. Add the second hop additions at flame out. Chill the wort to 67 °F (19 °C) and aerate thoroughly. The proper pitch rate is 2 packages of liquid yeast or 1 package of liquid yeast in a 2.5 liter (0.67 gallon) starter. Follow the fermentation and packaging instructions for the all-grain version.

Ingredients
13 lbs. (5.9 kg) German wheat malt
2.75 lbs. (1.25 kg) German Pilsner malt
2.75 lbs. (1.25 kg) Simpsons Golden Promise™ malt
13 oz. (0.37 kg) honey malt
1.4 lbs. (0.64 kg) white sugar (15 min.)
14.4 AAU German Magnum hops (60 min.) (1 oz./28 g at 14.4% alpha acids)
8.25 AAU Citra® hops (5 min.) (0.75 oz./21 g at 11% alpha acids)
9.75 AAU NZ Nelson Sauvin hops (1 min.) (0.75 oz./21 g at 13% alpha acids)
5.25 AAU NZ Motueka hops (0 min.) (0.75 oz./21 g at 7% alpha acids)
White Labs WLP001 (California Ale) or Wyeast 1056 (American Ale) or Fermentis US-05 yeast
3⁄4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Two or three days before brew day, make a 2-qt. (2-L) yeast starter, aerating the wort thoroughly (preferably with oxygen) before pitching the yeast.

On brew day, prepare your ingredients; mill the grain, measure your hops, and prepare your water. This recipe uses reverse osmosis (RO) water. Add 1/4 tsp 10% phosphoric acid per 5 gallons (19 L) of brewing water, or until water measures pH 5.5 at room temperature. Add 1 tsp. calcium chloride (CaCl2) to the mash.

This recipe uses a multi-step mash with a mashout. On brew day, mash in all the grains at 104 °F (40 °C) in 22 qts. (21 L) of water and hold this temperature for 10 minutes. Raise the temperature by infusion or direct heading to 131 °F (55 °C) for 15 minutes, then raise to 146 °F (63 °C) for 40 minutes, then to 158 °F (70 °C) for 15 minutes. Finally raise to 168 °F (76 °C) for 15 minutes to mashout, recirculating. This step mash helps provide a more attenuative wort and improves clarity. Fly sparge with 168 °F (76 °C) water until 6.5 gallons (25 L) of wort is collected.

Boil the wort for 90 minutes, adding the hops at times indicated in the recipe. Add the sugar in the last 15 minutes of the boil. After adding the final hops when the heat is turned off, let the wort stand for 20 minutes before chilling the wort. This technique is called a hop stand and will add flavor, aroma, and some bitterness from the flameout hops. Chill to 66 °F (19 °C).

Oxygenate, then pitch the yeast starter. Allow fermentation temperature to rise to no more than 72 °F (22 °C) until fermentation is complete. Rack and allow the beer to drop bright, using crash cooling or fining if necessary. Prime and bottle condition, or keg and force carbonate to 2 to 2.5 volumes. This is a beer that should age well, as the grainy notes merge with the bitterness and dryness in the aftertaste and the alcohol and fruit smooth out over time.

Ingredients
9 lbs. (4.1 kg) wheat liquid malt extract
3 lbs. (1.36 kg) dried wheat malt extract
13 oz. (0.37 kg) honey malt
1.4 lbs. (0.64 kg) white sugar (15 min.)
14.4 AAU German Magnum hops (60 min.) (1 oz./28 g at 14.4% alpha acids)

3⁄4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Two or three days before brew day, make a 2-qt. (2-L) yeast starter, aerating the wort thoroughly (preferably with oxygen) before pitching the yeast.

On brew day, heat 6 gallons (23 L) of water in the brew kettle up to 158 °F (70 °C). Place the honey malt in a mesh bag, and steep in the hot water for 30 minutes. Remove the mesh bag, then turn the heat off. Add the malt extracts and stir thoroughly to dissolve the extract completely. You do not want to feel liquid extract at the bottom of the kettle when stirring with your spoon. Turn the heat back on and bring to a boil. Boil the wort for 60 minutes, adding the hops at the times indicated in the recipe. Add the white sugar in the last 15 minutes of the boil.

After adding the final hops when the heat is turned off, let the wort stand for 20 minutes before chilling the wort. This technique is called a hop stand and will add flavor, aroma, and some bitterness from the flameout hops. Chill to 66 °F (19 °C).

Oxygenate the wort, then pitch the yeast starter. Allow the fermentation temperature to rise to no more than 72 °F (22 °C) until fermentation is complete. Rack and allow the beer to drop bright, using crash cooling or fining if necessary. Prime and bottle condition, or keg and force carbonate to 2 to 2.5 volumes.

White Russian Imperial Pale Ale
(5 gallon/19 L, extract with grains)
OG = 1.072 FG = 1.013
IBU = 40 SRM = 5 ABV = 8%

Ingredients
0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) cara-pils malt
8 lbs. (3.6 kg) extra light dried malt extract
12 AAU Target hop pellets (45 min.) (1.5 oz./43 g at 8% alpha acids)
2 AAU Styrian Goldings hop pellets (15 min.) (0.5 oz/14 g at 4% alpha acids)
0.5 oz. (14 g) Styrian Goldings hop pellets (0 min.)
0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) dark roast coffee beans, coarsely crack
2 cups white creme de cacao
Wyeast 1098 (British Ale) or White Labs WLP007 (Dry English Ale) or Lallemand Nottingham yeast
3/4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
In 3 gals. (11 L) of cold water, steep malt. Heat to 170 °F (77 °C) and remove grains. Wash grains with 1 qt. (1 L) hot water into kettle. Add malt extract off heat and stir until fully dissolved. Bring to a boil. Add Target hop pellets, boil 30 minutes. Add first addition of Styrian Goldings pellets. Boil 15 more minutes, turn off the heat, and add the second Styrian Golding hop addition. Chill, top up in fermenter to 5.25 gals. (20 L), and cool to 70 °F (21 °C). Pitch yeast then ferment cool, about 60 °F (16 °C) for eight to 10 days, rack to secondary, and condition cool for three weeks. A few days before bottling or kegging, coarsely crack coffee beans and steep in enough vodka to cover them completely in a covered jar. Shake occasionally. At bottling, prime the beer with corn sugar and add the coffee extract, pouring it through a fine mesh strainer or several layers of cheesecloth. Add créme de cacao and gently stir in the flavorings. Bottle and age two to three weeks or until fully carbonated.

All-grain recipe:
Mash 11 lbs. (5 kg) pale malt, 3 lbs. (1.4 kg) mild ale malt, and 1 lb. (0.45 kg) wheat malt in 20 qts. (19 L) water at 152 °F (67 °C) for 60 minutes. Sparge with 12 qts. (11.4 L) water at 169 °F (76 °C) to collect 6.5 gallons (24.6 L) wort in your kettle. Proceed with boil and hopping schedule as above, reducing wort to 5.25 gals (20 L).

Notes:
The use of white creme de cacao, as well as the cold extraction of the coffee, is a means of getting that surprising coffee and chocolate flavor and aroma without darkening the beer. Obviously, if you want to make this a darker beer you can add crystal, chocolate, or black malt and use any means you can think of to get the chocolate and coffee into the beer. If you are not afraid of a bit more intensity, chop up a vanilla bean and steep it with the coffee beans.

Barren Hill Tavern & Brewery Justa Porter clone
Barren Hill Tavern & Brewery Justa Porter clone
Erin Wallace re-opened one of the oldest taverns in the United States two years ago, as a logical next step from her successes running some of the best craft beer bars in Philadelphia. You can’t visit Barren Hill without noticing a distinct Colonial American style, and the tavern comes by it honestly; there has been a brewery and tavern in this historic building since 1732, predating the Revolution by more than forty years. The three (documented) resident ghosts must be overjoyed to have the place full of life again, since it had sat vacant for nearly three years before Erin and company took on the challenge of reopening an historic institution. Her decision to do so saved the building from the developers’ wrecking balls, as other bidders were considering condos for the site, and local beer lovers are the real winners. Barren Hill’s beer lineup features everything from outstanding and simple classics (a recent visit provided me with a brilliant English bitter and a wonderfully bready Maibock) to more exotic sour and barrel-aged options, to say nothing of a variety of collaborations with local, national, and international breweries. Brewer Dave Wood keeps the taps full, and Barren Hill beer is also featured at another of Erin’s enterprises, a local beer garden. You can visit the brewery and tavern just outside the Philadelphia city limits at 646 Germantown Pike, Lafayette Hill, Pennsylvania.

OG = 1.048 FG = 1.012
IBU = 27 SRM = 48 ABV = 4.9%

Ingredients
7.6 lbs. (3.45 kg) 2-row pale malt
1.25 lbs. (0.6 kg) black patent malt
10 oz. (0.3 kg) flaked barley
10 oz. (0.3 kg) crystal malt (40 °L)
6 oz. (170 ­g) chocolate malt (450 °L)
5.6 AAU Challenger hops (60 min.) (0.75 oz./21 g at 7.5% alpha acids)
3 AAU Bramling Cross hops (15 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 6% alpha acids)
Wyeast Labs 1028 (London Ale) or White Labs WLP013 (London Ale) yeast
3⁄4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Mill the grains and mix with 3.3 gallons (12.4 L) of 164 °F (73 °C) strike water to reach a mash temperature of 152 °F (67 °C). Hold this temperature for 60 minutes. Vorlauf until your runnings are clear. Sparge the grains with 4.35 gallons (16.5 L) and top up as necessary to obtain 6 gallons (23 L) of wort. Boil for 60 minutes, adding hops according to the ingredient list.

After the boil, turn off heat and chill the wort to slightly below fermentation temperature, about 65 °F (18 °C). Aerate the wort with pure oxygen or filtered air and pitch yeast. Ferment at 66 °F (19 °C) for 7 days. Raise to 72 °F (22 °C) for seven more days. Once the beer reaches terminal gravity, bottle or keg the beer and carbonate to approximately 2.5 volumes. You may want to cold-crash the beer prior to packaging to 35 °F (2 °C) for 48 hours to improve clarity.

Ingredients
5.5 lbs. (2.5 kg) pale liquid malt extract
1.25 lbs. (0.6 kg) black patent malt
10 oz. (0.3 kg) crystal malt (40 °L)
6 oz. (0.17 kg) chocolate malt (450 °L)

Wyeast Labs 1028 (London Ale) or White Labs WLP013 (London Ale) yeast
3⁄4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Bring 5.6 gallons (21 L) of water to approximately 162 °F (72 °C) and hold there, and steep milled specialty grains in grain bags for 15 minutes. Remove the grain bags, and let drain fully. Add liquid extract while stirring, and stir until completely dissolved. Bring the wort to a boil. Boil for 60 minutes, adding hops according to the ingredient list.

After the boil, turn off heat and chill the wort to slightly below fermentation temperature, about 65 °F (18 °C). Aerate the wort with pure oxygen or filtered air and pitch yeast. Ferment at 66 °F (19 °C) for 7 days. Raise to 72 °F (22 °C) for seven more days. Once the beer reaches terminal gravity, bottle or keg the beer and carbonate to approximately 2.5 volumes. You may want to cold-crash the beer prior to packaging to 35 °F (2 °C) for 48 hours to improve clarity.

Tips for Success:
Head Brewer Dave Wood notes that Barren Hill’s water is slightly on the hard side, with a generally neutral pH level, so a light mineral salt addition may yield better results if your water skews toward the softer side. Since this is a porter that lands more on the lighter side, brewers may also want to mash slightly warmer than usual to retain a bit more body and mouthfeel.

10 oz. (0.28 kg) flaked oats
4 oz. (0.11 kg) acidulated malt
3.3 oz. (85 g) honey malt
6.3 AAU Warrior pellet hops (60 mins.) (0.4 oz./11 g at 15.8% alpha acids)
0.6 oz. (17 g) Tettnang pellet hops (0 mins.)
0.8 oz. (23 g) Mosiac pellet hops (0 mins.)
0.6 oz. (17 g) US Saaz pellet hops (0 mins.)
1/2 tsp. Irish moss (30 mins.)
1/2 tsp. yeast nutrient (15 mins.)
White Labs WLP566 (Belgian Saison II) or Wyeast 3711 (French Saison) yeast
1 cup (200 g) dextrose (if bottling)

Step by step
Mash the grains at 151°F (66°C) with 3.5 gallons (13 L) of water for 60 minutes. Mash out, vorlauf, and then slowly sparge at 175°F (77°C) to collect approximately 6 gallons (23 L) of wort. Boil for 60 minutes, adding the hops as instructed. Cool the wort to 68°F (20°C). Pitch the yeast, then keep the beer at 68°F (20°C) for 48 hours before letting it free rise until fermentation is complete. Condition for 2 weeks and then bottle or keg.

Extract with grains option:
Replace the Pilsner and 2-row pale malt in the recipe with 3.3 pounds (1.5 kg) Muntons extra light unhopped liquid malt extract, 22 ounces (0.62 kg) light dried malt extract, and 1 pound (0.45 kg) 2-row pale malt. Steep the crushed grains in 2.5 gallons (9.5 L) of water at 151°F (66°C) for 30 minutes. Remove the grains from the wort and rinse with 2 quarts (2 L) of hot water. Add the malt extract and boil 60 minutes. Add the hops, Irish moss, and yeast nutrient as specified. Increase Warrior pellet hops at 60 minutes to 7.9 AAU (0.5 ounces/14 g at 15.8 percent alpha acids) to compensate for a smaller boil volume. When done, add the wort to 2 gallons (7.6 L) of cold water in the sanitized fermenter and top off with filtered water up to 5 gallons (19 L). Follow the remaining portion of the all-grain recipe.

Wyeast 1968 (London ESB) or White Labs WLP002 (English Ale) yeast
0.75 cups corn sugar (for priming)

Step by Step
Begin by heating 2.1 gallons (8.1 L) of water to 167 °F (75 °C) in your brewpot. Place the crushed grains in a large grain steeping bag and submerge them in this water. Steep grains at 156 °F (69 °C) for 30–45 minutes. After steep, remove grain bag and let drip dry. Add dried malt extract and 0.9 gallons (3.4 L) of water to brewpot and bring to a boil.

(Note: You can be heating this mixture while you are steeping.) Boil for 60 minutes, adding hops and Irish moss at times indicated. With 15 minutes left in the boil, add liquid malt extract — stirring well so extract dissolves completely. After boil, cool wort and siphon to fermenter. Top up with water to 5 gallons (19 L), aerate and pitchyeast. Ferment at 68 °F (20 °C).

Tips for Success:
The brewery’s recipe calls for a British lager malt, which is a lightly kilned base malt. If this type of base malt is unavailable at your local homebrew shop, a high-grade Pilsen malt could be used as a substitute.

 Winterbock (Wintergreen Doppelbock)
(5 gallons/19 L, partial mash)
OG = 1.079 FG = 1.018
IBU = 16 SRM = 24 ABV = 8.5%

Ingredients
4 lbs. (1.8 kg) Weyermann dark Munich malt (9° L)
1 lb. (0.45 kg) Carapils malt
0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) chocolate malt
0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) medium crystal malt (60° L)
3 lbs. (1.4 kg) light dried malt extract
3 lbs. (1.4 kg) Munich dried malt extract
4 oz. (113 g) maltodextrin powder
1 AAU Hallertauer hops (60 min.) (0.25 oz./7 g at 4% alpha acids)
2 AAU Hallertauer hops (30 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 4% alpha acids)
0.75 oz. (21 g) Hallertauer hops (0 min.)
2 oz. (58 g) dried wintergreen leaves
1 oz. (28 g) baker's wintergreen extract (optional)
Wyeast 2308 (Munich Lager) or White Labs WLP838 (Southern German Lager) yeast
1 oz. baker's wintergreen extract (optional)
2/3 cup corn sugar for priming

Step by Step
Heat 8 qts. (7.6 L) of water to 169 °F (76 °C). Crack grains and mix into water. Mash should settle to 157 °F (69 °C). Hold 45 min., run off, and sparge with 3 gal. of water at 168 °F (76 °C). To kettle add extracts and maltodextrin powder. Bring to boil first round of hops. Boil 30 min. Add second round of hops and boil another 30 min. Add remaining hops and wintergreen leaves and remove from heat. Give the wort a long stir to create a whirlpool and let steep for 30 min. Chill the wort and add to fermenter along with cold water to make 5.25 gal (20 L). At 65 °F (18 °C), pitch yeast (pitch big; this needs a clean taste, no DMS or similar off-flavors are allowed).

Ferment at 65 °F (18 °C) for one day then gradually cool to 55 °F (13 °C) and hold for 10 to 12 days. Rack to secondary and lager at 38 to 40 °F (3 to 4 °C) for six to eight weeks. Prime with corn sugar, and add wintergreen extract if desired. Age in bottles (or keg) for two to six weeks.

Brewing Notes:

All-grain option:
Replace the dried malt extract, adding additional 6 lbs. (2.7 kg) Munich malt and add 5 lbs. (2.3 kg) pale malt, increase the crystal malt to 1 lb. (0.45 kg). Mash at the same temperature and for the same time but use 5.5 gal. (20.7 L) mash water and sparge with 4.5 gal. (17 l) water. Your boil should be timed to reduce the wort down to 5.25 gal (20 L). Use the same hop schedule as above.

Extract with grains option:
Steep the Carapils, crystal, and chocolate (amounts as above) in 3 gal. (11 L) of cold water, heat gradually to 170 °F (77 °C), then remove grains. Wash grains with 1 gallon (4 L) hot water. Increase the Munich malt extract to 4.75 lbs. (2.2 kg).

One interesting variation I tried a couple years ago was to add a jar of root beer soda extract at bottling. It might work with sarsaparilla or birch beer extract as well.

Ingredients
9 lbs. 9 oz. (4.3 kg) Weyermann Pilsner malt (2 °L)
2.25 lbs. (1 kg) Weyermann Munich Type I malt (6 °L)
1 lbs. (0.45 kg) Dingemans aromatic malt (21 °L)
5.0 oz. (0.14 kg) Dingemans Special B (150 °L)
5.6 AAU Northern Brewer or Mt. Hood hops (90 min.) (0.7 oz./20 g of 8% alpha acid)
1 oz. (28 g) Spalt hops (10 min.)
0.5 oz. (14 g) Saaz hops (10 min.)
Wyeast 1214 (Abbey Ale), 1762 (Belgian Abbey II), 1388 (Belgian Strong Ale), 3787 (Trappist Ale) or White Labs WLP500 (Trappist Ale), WLP530 (Abbey Ale) yeast
1 cup brown sugar (in the kettle)
1 cup dry malt extract (for priming)

Step by Step
Use about 4.1 gallons (~16 L) of water to mash in at about 146 °F (63 °C) for a 30-minute rest. Then raise the mash temperature to about 152 °F (67 °C), using a combination of hot-water infusion and direct heat. Let rest for 30 minutes. Start sparging with 180 °F (82 °C) water and let the grain-bed temperature rise to about 168 °F (76 °C). (Cool down sparge water to 168 °F (76 °C) at this temperature.) Sparge slowly, for at least 90 minutes. Discontinue the sparge when the kettle gravity reaches about 1.056 (14 °P). Add the brown sugar to the kettle. Boil for 120 minutes. Add bittering hops 30 minutes into the boil. Add the two flavor/aroma hops about 10 minutes before shut-down. Check the gravity. It should be around 1.066 (16.5 °P) after evaporation losses. Liquor the wort down if necessary. Using a spatula, gently create a whirlpool in the kettle and wait for about 30 minutes to allow the trub to settle. Cool to a pitching temperature of 64 °F (18 °C). Pitch yeast and aerate. Let primary fermentation run its course and the debris to settle out. This may take about three weeks, by which time the beer should be attenuated down to about 1.012 (3 °P). Rack and age for about 2 months at about 50–55 °F (10–13 °C). Then keg and force carbonate or add priming agent and package in bottles.

This is a labor-intensive beer to produce, utilizing a triple batch sparge, kräusening, a three-week bulk lagering period, and oak chip aging. The result is a malty and firmly hopped, oak-aged lager softened by some natural carbonation. The lager yeast allows the piney and floral aromatics to shine while the oak chips heighten the maltiness of the brew.

Ingredients
12.5 lbs. (5.11 kg) Vienna malt
1 lb. (0.45 kg) Simpsons Golden Naked Oats™ malt
1 lb. (0.45 kg) melanoidin malt
17.5 AAU Summit™ pellet hops (60 min.) (1.15 oz./32 g at 15.2% alpha acids)
0.75 oz. (21 g) Nugget pellet hops (dry hop)
0.75 oz. (21 g) Mt. Hood pellet hops (dry hop)
0.75 oz. (21 g) Fuggle pellet hops (dry hop)
0.75 oz. (21 g) Centennial pellet hops (dry hop)
0.25 oz. (7 g) dark toasted American oak chips (added during dry hop)
1/2 tsp. yeast nutrients (15 min.)
1 Whirfloc® tablet (15 min.)
Kräusen beer (See step by step)
8 oz. (0.23 kg) pale dried malt extract2.5 g Summit™ pellet hops
White Labs WLP802 (Czech Budejovice Lager) or Wyeast 2278 (Czech Pils) yeast
3/4 cup (150 g) dextrose (if priming)

Step by Step
Several days before your brew day be sure to make a yeast starter. It is recommended that you pitch 468 billion yeast cells for this recipe. Mill the grains and mix with 3.9 gallons (14.7 L) of 154 °F (68 °C) strike water to reach a mash temperature of 142 °F (61 °C). Hold at this temperature for 75 minutes. Step the mash (increase the temperature) to 158 °F (70 °C) and hold for an additional 15 minutes before performing an optional mash out at 168 °F (76 °C) for 10 minutes. Vorlauf until your runnings are clear. You will need 5.2 gallons (19.7 L) of 170 °F (77 °C) sparge water. The sparge water is divided across a triple batch sparge as follows. Drain the mash tun then refill first with 1.6 gallons (6.1 L). Drain the mash tun then refill a second time with 2.6 gallons (9.8 L). Drain the mash tun again and add the final 1 gallon (3.8 L) until 7 gallons (26.5 L) of 1.050 SG wort is collected. Boil for 90 minutes adding hops, yeast nutrient, and kettle finings according to the ingredients list. After the boil, turn off the heat and whirlpool the kettle by gently stirring for 2 minutes. Let rest for an additional 13 minutes. Chill the wort to 55 °F (13 °C), aerate, and pitch yeast. Ferment at 57 °F (14 °C) for 7 days, then lower to 45 °F (7 °C) and hold for 4 more days. Transfer the beer to a secondary vessel that contains the dry hops and oak chips. Harvest and store about 2 fluid ounces (60 mL) worth of yeast slurry from the primary fermenter yeast cake, and allow the beer to rise back up to 57 °F (14 °C) in the secondary fermenter. Make a small amount of kräusen beer by boiling 8 oz. (0.23 kg) of pale dried malt extract with 0.4 gallons (1.5 L) of water for roughly 45 minutes, until you reduce it down to about 0.26 gallons (1 L) of 1.068 specific gravity wort. Add 2.5 grams of Summit™ hops (15.2% alpha acids) at flameout, cool, and transfer to a growler (or small carboy). Pitch 2 fluid ounces (60 mL) worth of yeast slurry and add an airlock. When active fermentation is present, transfer the kräusen beer into the secondary vessel that your main batch is in. Hold the secondary vessel at 57 °F (14 °C) for 3 days after adding the kräusen beer, then slowly cool to lagering temperature (35–45 °F/2–7 °C), depending on activity levels of yeast strain). Lager for 3 weeks at this temperature. Bottle or keg as normal.

Extract with grains option:
Substitute the Vienna and melanoidin malts in the all-grain recipe with 8 lbs. (3.6 kg) Briess Vienna liquid malt extract and 1 lb. (0.45 kg) Weyermann Carared malt (20 °L). Steep grains in 2 gallons (7.5 L) of 150 °F (66 °C) water for 20–30 minutes while you continue to heat the water up to no hotter than 170 °F (77 °C) in order to avoid extracting tannins. Remove the grain bag, top your kettle up with enough pre-heated water to reach a total pre-boil volume of 7 gallons (26.5 L), and turn your heat source back on. Once you reach a boil, add your malt extract and hops according to the ingredients list during a 90-minute boil. Follow the remaining portion of the all-grain recipe.

Tips for Success:
Base Camp Brewing Co. brewers recommend using extremely soft base water and adding 2 grams of calcium sulfate (gypsum) plus 1 gram of calcium chloride to the mash for this recipe. This beer is very flexible with regards to base malt. Brewers are encouraged to substitute the listed Vienna malt for other darker pale malts such as Maris Otter, Golden Promise, ESB malt, etc. If you are an extract brewer, you can substitute with Maris Otter liquid malt extract.

O.75 cup of corn sugar for priming

Step by Step
Since there are no grains in this recipe, it is simple to make. Add the malt extract to three gallons of hot water and bring to a boil. Add the Tettnanger hops and boil for 60 minutes. Add the Saaz hops for the last two minutes of the boil.

When you are done boiling, strain out the hops. Add the wort to two gallons of cool water in a sanitized fermenter and top off with cool water to 5.5 gallons (21 L). Cool the wort to 68 ºF (20 °C), aerate the beer and pitch your yeast. Allow the beer to cool over the next few hours to 68–70 ºF (20-21 °C) and ferment for 10–14 days. Bottle your beer, age for a minimum of two to three weeks and enjoy!

All-grain option:
Replace the light malt extract with 10 lbs. of two-row pale malt (2° L). Mash all your grains at 155 ºF (68 °C) for 45 minutes. Collect enough wort to boil for 90 minutes and have a 5.5-gallon (21 L) yield.

Wrecking Bar Brewpub Boomslang IPA clone
The beautiful home of Wrecking Bar Brewpub, a Victorian mansion, was rescued by brewpub owner Bob Sandage in 2010. From the start, it was important to the team to control the message of their beers, from grain to glass, and to educate their customers in the fine points of craft beer. They take the same approach to their food, sourcing all produce and meats from local farms — including an organic farm that Bob and business partner Stevenson Rosslow recently purchased. They plan to use the farm to launch a sour and wild ale program, fermenting with local microflora and barrel aging. Head Brewer Gavin McKenna and Brewmaster Neal Engleman keep the pub’s 11–15 taps flowing. Visit the Wrecking Bar Brewpub at 292 Moreland Avenue NE, Atlanta, Georgia.

White Labs WLP001 (California Ale), Wyeast 1056 (American Ale), or Safale US-05 yeast
3⁄4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Mill the grains and mix with 4 gallons (15 L) of 164 °F (73 °C) strike water to reach a mash temperature of 152 °F (67 °C). For those without hard water, add 1⁄4 teaspoon of gypsum to mash and sparge water, and add 0.9 mL/gallon (0.23 mL/L) phosphoric acid in mash water. Hold mash temperature for 60 minutes. Vorlauf until runnings are clear, and lauter into the kettle. Sparge the grains with 5 gallons (19 L) of water and top up as necessary to obtain 6.5 gallons (25 L) of wort. Boil for 90 minutes, adding hops according to the ingredient list. After the boil, turn off heat, add whirlpool hops, and whirlpool for at least five minutes before draining into the fermenter. Then chill the wort to slightly below fermentation temperature, about 65 °F (18 °C). Aerate the wort with pure O2 or filtered air. Pitch yeast.

Ferment at 68 °F (20 °C) for 7 days. At 7 days, allow the beer to free-rise until the completion of fermentation, then chill to 55 °F (13 °C). Add half of the dry hops and age for 2 more days. At that point, rouse the beer and initial dry hops, and add remaining dry hops. After 3 more days, bottle or keg the beer and carbonate to approximately 2.5 volumes. Cold-crash prior to packaging to 35 °F
(2 °C) for 48 hours to improve clarity.

Ingredients
7.4 lbs. (3.4 kg) Golden Promise pale ale malt
7 oz. (200 g) flaked barley
5 oz. (140 g) Carahell malt (10 °L)
4.4 AAU East Kent Golding hops (60 min.)
(1.25 oz./43 g at 5.25% alpha acids)

Step by Step
Mash the grains and flaked oats together at 160 °F (71 °C) for 60 minutes and sparge with 175 °F (79 °C) water. Collect approximately 4.5 gallons (17 L) of wort and then add water to make 6 gallons (23 L). Boil for 60 minutes, adding hops at times indicated. Chop the peppers and add them at flameout. Then cover the kettle and allow the peppers to steep for 15 minutes. Cool the wort to 75 °F (24 °C) and transfer to yoru fermenter through a sanitized strainer to remove the peppers. Aaerate, and pitch yeast and then allow the beer to cool over the next few hours to 68 °F (20 °C) and hold at this temperature until the beer has finished fermenting. Condition for 1 week then bottle or keg.

SRM = 5 ABV = 6.3%

Ingredients
6 lb. 4 oz. (2.8 kg) Rahr Premium 2-row pale malt
1.0 lb. (0.45 kg) coarse ground ivory teff flour
1 lb. 8 oz. (0.68 kg) Simpson’s Golden Naked Oats
1 lb. 12 oz. (0.8 kg) unmalted wheat
1.0 lb (0.45 kg) malted wheat
5.0 oz. (0.14 kg) rice or oat hulls
5.5 g grains of paradise
4.0 g Pakistani rose
7.0 g bitter orange peel
5.5 g tamarind paste
2.3 g ground coriander
1.0 oz. (28 g) pitted dates
10 oz. (0.28 kg) wildflower honey
White Labs WLP400 (Belgian Wit Ale), or Wyeast 3522 (Belgian Witbier) yeast.

Step by Step
Mash all the grains at 138 °F (59 °C) for 30 minutes. (The rice or oat hulls are to assist run-off which can be problematic with wheat beers; you should add them to the mash along with the other grains.) Add sufficient boiling water to raise temperature to 155 °F (68 °C) for a further 30 minutes. Run off and sparge to collect 5.5–6.0 gallons (20–23 L) of wort, and boil it for 60 minutes. Cool, run into fermenter, adding spices in a hop or muslin bag and pitch yeast. Mix the honey and dates with enough boiling water (about 0.5–1 pint) to give a pourable slurry and add to the fermenter after the high kräusen has fallen. Rack to secondary after 5–7 days, leave 1–2 weeks to clarify and reach finishing gravity, then bottle or keg as per normal procedures.

Malt Extract Version
You can’t substitute the pale malt with pale extract and do a partial mash with the other grains, because the presence of so much unmalted wheat will likely give just a sticky mess. I suggest a different route, namely start with a witbier kit. These are available from suppliers, and you should follow their directions up to the end of the boil. Then as above, cool, run into fermenter, adding spices in a hop or muslin bag and pitch yeast. Mix the honey and dates with enough boiling water (about 0.5–1 pint) to give a pourable slurry and add to the fermenter after the high kräusen has fallen. Rack to secondary after 5–7 days, leave 1–2 weeks to clarify and reach finishing gravity, then bottle or keg as per normal procedures.

IBU = 35 SRM = 9 ABV = 6.3%

When formulating an extract version of the all-grain recipe Old Timer’s Bock, we had to make some sacrifices due to the large percent of flaked corn in that recipe. As such, this recipe will end up different (the reason for it getting a different name), but still very tasty.

Ingredients
6.6 lbs. (3 kg) Briess CBW® Pale Ale liquid malt extract
2 lbs. (0.9 kg) Briess CBW® Sparkling Amber liquid malt extract
9.2 AAU Huell Melon hops (60 min.) (1.5 oz./43 g at 6.1% alpha acids)
SafLager S-23 or White Labs WLP820 (Oktoberfest/Märzen Lager) or Wyeast 2206 (Bavarian Lager) yeast
2⁄3 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Dissolve the malt extracts in warm water to give a final volume of 5.5 gallons (21 L) and then bring to a boil. Once a boil is reached, add the hops (and any salts, if needed, to give concentrations of 96 ppm Na+ and 148 ppm Cl-) and then boil for 1 hour.

Cool to 52 °F (11 °C) and pitch two packets of the yeast or an adequately-sized starter if using liquid yeast. Keep at 50–52 °F (10–11 °C) for two weeks, by which time the gravity should be down to 1.010. Then raise the temperature to 60–65 °F (16–18 °C) for two days for a diacetyl rest (not something Hartmann would have done). Then allow to cool gradually to
31 °F (-0.6 °C) for 20 days and put into the serving tank. Keg or bottle in the usual manner.

IBU = 52 SRM = 11 ABV = 6.6%

The Amber DME is made with some crystal malt, which probably would not have been used in the 1880s, but I wanted to keep this recipe simple and to avoid doing a partial mash with amber grain malt. If you wish to, you can partial mash with 2 lbs. (0.91 kg) of the Maris Otter malt, eliminating the amber extract and using 6 lbs. (2.7 kg) of the liquid extract.

Ingredients
7 lbs. (3.2 kg) Maris Otter liquid malt extract
1.4 lbs. (0.64 kg) amber dried malt extract
14 AAU Challenger hops (60 min.) (2 oz./57 g at 7% alpha acids)
SafAle S-04 or Wyeast 1099 (Whitbread Ale) yeast
2⁄3 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by step
Dissolve the malt extracts in 6 gallons (23 L) of hot water while off heat. Once malt extract is fully dissolved, bring wort to a boil. Boil for 60 minutes, adding the Challenger hops at the start. Cool to about 70 °F (21 °C) and pitch the yeast. Ferment 7 days at about 65 °F (18 °C), then rack to secondary for a further 5–7 days before racking to keg or bottling.

Yarrow Pale Ale (YPA)
Yarrow Pale Ale (YPA)
(5 gallons/19 L, partial mash)
OG = 1.065 FG = 1.013
IBU = 43 SRM = 7 ABV = 7.1%

Ingredients
2 lbs. (0.91 kg) pale malt
0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) medium crystal malt (50° to 60° L)
0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) wheat malt
6 lbs. (2.7 kg) light dried malt extract
7 AAU Northern Brewer hops (60 min.) (1 oz./28 g at 7% alpha acid)
6.5 AAU Fuggle hops (20 min.) (1 oz./28 g at 6.5% alpha acid)
0.5 oz. (14 g) dried fresh yarrow flowers (0 min.)
1/8 oz. (3.5 g) dried fresh savory (0 min.)
1/8 oz. (3.5 g) dried fresh thyme (0 min.)
Wyeast 1098 (London Ale) or White Labs WLP013 (London Ale) or Lallemand Nottingham yeast
2/3 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Heat 1.25 gal. (4.7 L) of water to 165 °F (74 °C), crush your grains, and add them to this water. Hold the mash at 152 °F (67 °C) for 60 min. Wash the grains with 2 gal. (7.6 L) of water at 169 °F (76 °C). Add the dried malt extract, then heat to boiling. Total boil is 60 min. Add the hops according to the schedule. Turn off the heat and add the yarrow, savory, and thyme (in a bouquet garni or fine mesh bag). Steep 30 min. as the wort begins to cool. Remove the herbs and chill the wort. Add to the fermenter after 60 min., along with enough water to make 5.25 gal (20 L). At 68 °F (20 °C) pitch the yeast.

Ferment near 65 °F (18 °C) for 10 days. If you prefer, rack to secondary and age an additional 10 to 15 days. Prime with corn sugar and bottle or keg and force carbonate.

All-grain version:
Omit the dried malt extract and increase the grain bill to 12.5 lbs. (5.7 kg) pale malt and 1 lb. (0.45 kg) wheat malt. Use 4.5 gal. (17.2 L) of mash water and sparge with 5 gal. (19 L) of water. Temperature and time are the same, as are the hop schedule and additions, but plan your boil to reduce the volume to 5.25 gal (20 L). Chill as quickly as you can after steeping the herbs for 30 minutes.

Extract with grains version:
Steep the crystal malt as above in 3 gal. (11 L) of water and gradually heat to 170 °F (77 °C), then remove them. Increase dried malt extract to 7 lbs. (2.3 kg) and add 1 cup (7 oz./200 g) light brown sugar to the boil as well.

Herbs:
The hops used in this recipe are for flavor and bitterness only. Aroma hops, a necessary part of an IPA, are replaced by a selection of very aromatic herbs from the garden, used essentially as dry hops. The combination given here is what I prefer, but of course you may use anything you like. This does have a bit of a medicinal aroma at first, but it mellows after a few weeks in the bottle. If you really want a fresh aroma and zing, use these herbs (or some additional) in the fermenter or secondary.

(5 gallons/19 L, extract with grains)
OG = 1.035 FG = 1.008
IBU = 6.6 SRM = 3 ABV = 3.5%

This Berliner weisse recipe creates a quick soured ale by using 4 oz. of acidulated malt and a live yogurt culture in a pre-boil starter held at 110 °F (43 °C) for 24 hours prior to brewing. This summer treat provides an authentic Berliner weisse flavor 49 weeks quicker than the traditional Berliner weisse. For an extra refreshing treat on a hot day, you can add a splash of woodruff syrup to each glass when serving. The woodruff syrup addition is an authentic way to create a balance between sweet and sour that will keep you cool and refreshed, even on the hottest of days.

Ingredients

4 lbs. (1.8 kg) extra pale liquid malt extract
1 lb. (0.45 kg) wheat dried malt extract
4 oz. (113 g) acidulated malt
3 AAU Cluster hops (30 min.) (0.3 oz/9 g at 8% alpha acids)
Yogurt culture
White Labs WLP001 (California Ale) or Wyeast 1056 (American Ale) or Safale US-05 yeast.
3⁄4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by step

24 hours before brew day, create a yogurt starter. This is done by adding 1 lb. (0.45 kg) of the extra pale liquid malt extract dissolved into one gallon (3.8 L) of 110 °F (43 °C) water. Pitch yogurt culture and hold at 110 °F (43 °C) for 24 hours. If yogurt culture is unavailable, one can use 3 tablespoons of plain Greek yogurt with live cultures or other reliable source Lacto; following the same instructions.

On brew day, bring 2 gallons (8 L) of water to 155 °F (68 °C) and turn off heat. In a grain bag, soak the acidulated malt in water for 25 minutes. Remove grain bag and allow liquid to drip back into the kettle. Then add 1 gallon (4 L) of water and heat to a boil. Turn off heat and stir in the reaming 3 lbs. (1.35 kg) liquid malt extract, dried malt extract, yogurt culture, being careful not to scorch the bottom of the pot. When dissolved, return heat to a rolling boil. Boil 60 minutes, adding hops with 15 minutes remaining.

When boil is complete, cool to 80 °F (27 °C). Move to fermenter and top off to 5.25 gallons (20 L). Aerate, pitch yeast, and ferment at the temperature recommended by the yeast manufacturer. After about one week, check the specific gravity. When it is within 3 to 4 gravity points of the expected final gravity (1.008), transfer to a secondary fermenter. Allow to clarify for 5 to 7 days. Bottle or keg.

3⁄4 cup (150 g) dextrose (if priming)

Step by Step

Heat 10.5 quarts (9.9 L) of water to 164 °F (73 °C). Stir in crushed grains and mash at 153 °F (67 °C) for 60 minutes. Collect 6.5 gallons (24.6 L) of wort and boil for a total of 90 minutes. Add hops at times indicated in ingredient list. Add sugars, Irish moss, and yeast nutrients with 15 minutes remaining in the boil. Dissolve cocoa in hot water and also add with 15 minutes remaining. After the boil is complete, cool wort, aerate, and pitch yeast. Ferment at 68 °F (20 °C). Add chocolate extract in secondary. Bottle or keg as normal.

Extract with grains option:

Substitute the pale ale malt in the all-grain recipe with 5 lbs. (1.9 kg) Maris Otter liquid malt extract. Place crushed grains in a nylon steeping bag. Heat 3 quarts (2.8 L) water to 164 °F (73 °C) and steep grains for 45 minutes at 153 °F (67 °C). Rinse grain bag with 1.5 quarts (~1.5 L) of water at 170 °F (77 °C). Add half of the liquid malt extract and water to make 3 gallons (11 L) of wort and bring to a boil. Boil 60 minutes, adding hops according to the ingredient list. With 15 minutes left, turn off heat and stir in the rest of the liquid malt extract. Add sugars, cocoa powder (dissolved in hot water), Irish moss, and yeast nutrients and resume boiling. Top off to 5-gallons and follow the remainder of the all-grain recipe.

Step by Step
Place all grains in your mash tun. You want your initial mash temperature for a drier beer so target near 148-151 °F (64-66 °C). Mash in 4.5 gallons of water. Mash for one hour. Run off wort and sparge with 160-170 °F (71-77 °C) sparge water until you have six gallons of wort. Boil wort 60 minutes adding hops and other additions according to the schedule. Cool wort to 55 °F (13 °C) or cooler and follow the lagering schedule you normally use. Pitch a large starter or three commercial yeast packages that are also at 55 °F (13 °C). Aerate or oxygenate well. Allow a long fermentation of about three weeks due to the high OG. Include a two- or three-day diacetyl rest in the mid-60s °F (~18 °C) as needed. Transfer to secondary and step down the temperature 2-3 degrees per day. Lager one month or longer, stopping when you get as close to freezing as you can get. Do not crash the secondary temperature or this may finish a bit sweet.

1 tsp (5 ml.) Irish moss (15 min.)
White Labs WLP007 (Dry English Ale) or Wyeast 1335 (British Ale II) yeast
O.75 cup of corn sugar (for priming)

Step by Step
Steep the crushed malts in 1.5 gallons (5.7 L) of water at 158 °F (70 °C) for 30 minutes. Remove grains from wort, rinse with 0.5 gallon (~2 L) of water under 170 °F (77 °C) if desired and add water to brewpot to make around 3 gallons (11 L) of wort total. Add the malt syrup and dry malt powder and bring to a boil. Add the Golding bittering hopsand boil for 60 minutes. Add the Irish moss for the last 15 minutes and the Cascade hops for the last 5 minutes of the boil.

After the boil, cool the wort, transfer to your fermenter and top off with cool water to 5.5 gallons (21 L). Aerate the wort and pitch your yeast. Allow the wort to cool over the next few hours to 68 °F (20 °C) and hold at this temperature until the beer has finished fermenting. Then bottle or keg your beer and enjoy!

All-grain option
This is a single step infusion mash. Replace the malt syrup and dry malt extract with 8.5 lbs. (3.9 kg) of pale 2-row malt, and mix with the rest of your grains in the extract version. Mash the grains together at 158 °F (70 °C) for 60 minutes. Collect approximately 7 gallons (26 L) wort to boil for 60 minutes and have a 5.5-gallon (21-L) yield.

Lower the amount of the Golding hops to 1.5 ounces (43 g) to account for higher hop utilization of a full wort boil. Add the hops and Irish moss as specified in ingredients.

Cool the wort to 75 °F (24 °C), aerate and pitch your yeast. Allow the wort to cool over the next few hours to 68 °F (20 °C) and hold at this temperature until the beer has finished fermenting. Rack to secondary and condition for 1 week, then bottle or keg your beer and enjoy!

(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.044 FG = 1.007
IBU = 15 SRM = 6 ABV= 4.7%

Ingredients
3 lb 12 oz. (1.7 kg) 6-row pale malt
2 lbs. (0.91 kg) 2-row pale malt
3 lb. 6 oz. (1.5 kg) corn grits
3 oz. (0.08 kg) crystal malt (20 °L)
0.5 tsp. calcium chloride (60 min.)
1 tsp. Irish moss (15 min.)
4 AAU Vanguard hops (60 min.)(1 oz./28 g of 4% alpha acids)
Wyeast 1056 (American Ale) or White Labs WLP001 (California Ale) or US-05 yeast (1.5 qt./1.5 L yeast starter)
3/4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Reserve corn grits and approximately 0.5 oz. (14 g) of 6-row malt. In your kettle, mash in the remaining malts with 12 qts. (11 L) of water at 138 °F (59 °C), so the grain bed comes to rest at around 127 °F (53 °C). In a large kitchen pot, combine the grits and reserved 6-row malt with 5 qts. (4.7 L) of water and begin heating this mixture to a boil. Stir the grits mixture frequently. (Option: when you reach 152 °F (67 °C), hold for 5 minutes before resuming heating.) Boil the grits mixture for 15 minutes, stirring frequently. Stir cooked grits into main mash. Your goal is a combined mash temperature of 150–152 °F (66–67 °C). If required, adjust temperature by directly heating the mash, or by adding cool water. Hold at this temperature for 45 minutes, then heat the mash to 170 °F (77 °C), stirring the mash frequently as you heat. Scoop or pour your mash into your lauter tun. (If you have a false bottom, add enough foundation water (at 170 °F/77 °C) to cover it.). Recirculate until the wort clears substantially (but don’t recirculate for more than 20 minutes). Begin running off wort, sparging with 190 °F (88 °C) water until the grain bed temperature reaches 170 °F (77 °C); then add cool water to your hot liquor tank and continue sparging with 170 °F (77 °C) water. (Heat sparge water to a greater temperature if grain bed temperature drops below 168 °F (76 °C). Boil wort for 90 minutes. Ferment at 65 °F (18 °C).

Ingredients
1 lb. 12 oz. (0.79 kg) 6-row pale malt
14 oz. (0.40 kg) 2-row pale malt
1 lb. 3 oz. (0.54 kg) grits
3 oz. (85 g) crystal malt (20 °L)
2 lb. (0.91 kg) Coopers Light dried malt extract (late addition)
1 lb. (0.45 kg kg) corn sugar
0.5 tsp. calcium chloride (60 min.)
1 tsp. Irish moss (15 min.)
4 AAU Vanguard hops (60 min.)(1 oz./28 g of 4% alpha acids)
Wyeast 1056 (American Ale) or White Labs WLP001 (California Ale) or US-05 yeast (1.5 qt./1.5 L yeast starter)
3/4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Review the all-grain recipe for the basic idea of cereal mashing. For the partial mash version, boil your grits and about 0.25 oz. (7.1 g) of crushed 6-row malt in a soup pot for 15 minutes. While grits are cooking, add the remaining grains to your brewpot and stir in 5.0 qts. (4.7 L) of water at 138 °F (59 °C). Hold at around 127 °F (53 °C) while grits are cooking. Add cooked grits to brewpot and stir. If temperature is outside the 150–152 °F (66–67 °C) range, add cold water or heat to adjust it. Hold at this temperature for 45 minutes, then heat mixture to 170 °F (77 °C). Scoop the contents of your brewpot to a 2.0-gallon (7.6-L) beverage cooler lined with a large steeping bag. Rinse brewpot. Recirculate, then start collecting your wort. Collect 1-2 cups of wort from the cooler, then gently pour the same volume of hot water (170 °F/77 °C) on the top of your grain bed. Repeat until you have collected 2.25 gallons (8.5 L) of wort. Add sugar and calcium chloride and bring to a boil. Add hops at times indicated. Add malt extract and Irish moss during final 15 minutes of the boil. Cool wort and transfer to fermenter. Top up with cool water to 5.0 gallons (19 L), aerate and pitch yeast. Ferment at 65 °F (18 °C). Rack to secondary to clarify beer. For bottle conditioning, prime with just over a cup of corn sugar (about 6.0 oz./170 g).

Zoc's Traditional Lambic
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.045 FG = 1.008}
IBU = 10 SRM = 3 ABV = 4.8%

Ingredients
6 lbs. (2.7 kg) pale malt
2 lbs. (0.9 kg) malted wheat.
2 lbs. (0.9 kg) unmalted wheat
1 oz. (28 g) aged Styrian Goldings hops (60 min.)
Wyeast 3278 (Belgian Lambic Blend) or White Labs WLP 655 (Belgian Sour Mix 1) yeast
Wyeast 3335 (Lactobacillus buchneri) or White Labs WLP673 (Lactobacillus buchneri)|
Wyeast 5733 (Pediococcus damnosus) or White Labs WLP (Pediococcus damnosus)
Wyeast 5112 (Brettanomyces bruxellensis) or White Labs WLP650 (Brettanomyces bruxellensis)
Wyeast 5151 (Brettanomyces claussenii) or White Labs WLP645 (Brettanomyces claussenii)
3⁄4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Combine 2.5 gallons (9.5 L) of 168 °F (75°C) water with the crushed wheat and barley. Mix well and adjust the temperature of the mash to 153 °F (68 °C). Let the mash rest at 153 °F (68 °C) for one hour and then recirculate until the wort runs clear. Sparge with 168 °F (75 °C) water until you get 6.25 gallons (24 L) into the boil kettle, which will be boiled down to 5.25 gallons (20 L).

Add hops when the wort comes to a boil and boil for 60 minutes. After the boil is complete, proceed to chill the wort to below 80 °F (15 °C), and transfer the contents into your fermenter. I ferment my lambics in a 5-gallon (19-L) oak barrel, but if you do not have a barrel then feel free to use your traditional fermenter. Pitch your yeast and bacterial blend (which contain strains of Saccharomyces and Brettanomyces yeasts and the bacterial strains of Lactobacillus, and Pediococcus) and aerate wort.

Aging times can vary but allow it to remain in the fermenter at least a year. After my initial pitch of a yeast/bacteria blend on brew day, I pitch the Lactobacillus and Pediococcus bacteria into the fermenter at three months from the initial brewing date. I then allow the fermentation to continue. At eight months, I pitch separate starters of Brettanomyces bruxellensis, and Brettanomyces claussenii. I don’t perform a secondary transfer, but continue my fermentation in the original vessel.

After a year I like to pull monthly samples to taste how the beer is evolving. Bottle or keg when the taste is what you were shooting for. Bottles can be kept for years and flavors will continue to evolve as they are cellared.

Bass p.l.c., England
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.049 FG = 1.010
IBU = 32 SRM = 11 ABV = 5%

Michael Jackson claims that Bass uses a single addition of Challenger and Northdown hops. He's probably right, but we think two Northern Brewer additions best captures the minty flavor and aroma of Bass's hop presence in a homebrew clone. This is an attempt to clone the bottle version found in the United States.

Ingredients
8 lbs. (3.6 kg) English pale ale malt
1 lb. (0.45 kg) flaked barley
1 lb. (0.45 kg) crystal malt (60 °L)
0.5 oz. (14 g) roasted barley (500 °L)
8.0 AAU Northern Brewer hops (60 min.) (0.89 oz./25 g of 9% alpha acids)
2.0 AAU Northern Brewer hops (15 min.) (0.22 oz./6.3 g of 9% alpha acids)
2.6 AAU Challenger hops (5 min.) (0.35 oz./10 g of 7.5% alpha acids)
1 tsp. Irish moss (15 min.)
1/4 tsp. yeast nutrients (15 min.)
Wyeast 1098 (British Ale) or White Labs WLP007(Dry English Ale) yeast
3/4 cups (150 g) dextrose (if priming)

Step by Step
Make 13 gallons (49 L) of brewing liquor with 100–150 ppm Ca2+ and a slightly lower level of carbonates. If you start with very soft, distilled, or reverse osmosis (RO) water, use 5 teaspoons of gypsum and 4 teaspoons of chalk (calcium carbonate) for your 13 gallons (49 L). (Yes, Burton-on-Trent’s water is harder than this, but you don’t need "extra chunky" water for a great clone.)

On brew day, mash the grains at 152 °F (67 °C) and rest for 1 hour. Vourlaf until runnings are clear and sparge, collecting around 6.5 gallons (25 L) and boil for 90 minutes. Add hops, Irish moss and yeast nutrients at times indicated in the ingredients list. After the boil, turn off the heat and chill the wort rapidly to 68 °F (20 °C). Aerate the wort well and pitch the yeast. Ferment at 68 °F (20 °C). When the beer has reached final gravity, transfer to a bottling bucket for priming and bottling, or transfer to a keg.

Partial Option: Omit the flaked barley. scale the 2-row pale ale malt down to 1 lb. (0.45 kg), and add 0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) Muntons light dried malt extract, and 3 lbs. 12 oz. (1.7 kg) Alexander's pale liquid malt extract (late addition) and 1 lb. 6 oz. (0.62 kg) corn sugar. Before brewing, make the brewing liquor: Add 6 gallons (23 L) of soft, distilled, or RO water to a clean brewing bucket and add 1 tsp. of gypsum and 0.5 tsp. of chalk to make your brewing liquor.

Place crushed grains in a nylon steeping bag. Heat 3 quarts (2.9 L) of brewing liquor to 163 °F (73 °C) and submerge the bag. Steep the grains at 152 °F (67 °C) for 45 minutes, then pull the bag out and let it drain over the pot in a colander. Rinse the grains with 1 quart (~1 L) of water at 170 °F (77 °C). Add brewing liquor to the steeped "grain tea" to make 3 gallons (11 L) of wort. Add the dried malt extract and corn sugar and the pot bring to a boil. Add the first charge of hops and boil for 60 minutes. Add other hops, Irish moss, and yeast nutrients at times indicated. With 15 minutes left in boil, shut off heat and stir in the liquid malt extract. Resume heating and finish the boil. Cool wort and transfer to fermenter. Top up to 5 gallons (19 L) with brewing liquor, aerate the wort well, and pitch the yeast. Ferment at 68 °F (20 °C).

OG = 1.056 FG = 1.013
IBU = 27 SRM = 4 ABV = 5.8%

Ingredients
6.75 lbs. (3.1 kg) Belgian wheat malt
4 lbs. (1.8 kg) Belgian pale two-row malt
0.75 lb. (0.34 kg) dextrin malt
5.4 AAU German Northern Brewer hops (60 min.) (0.75 oz./21 g at 7.2% alpha acid)
2.4 AAU Tettnanger hops (30 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 4.8% alpha acid)

"My philosophy on brewing these days is to keep it simple and allow the ingredients to shine through." - Michael Meissner (New South Wales)

Ingredients
5 lb. 8 oz. (2.5 kg) Joe White wheat malt
4 lb. 6.5 oz. (2.0 kg) Joe White Pilsner malt
1 lb. 1.6 oz (0.50 kg) Weyermann Vienna malt
4.3 AAU Mt Hood hops (60 mins) (1.2 oz./33 g of 3.7% alpha acids)
White Labs WLP300 (Hefeweizen ale) yeast (2 qt./2 L starter)
9.0 oz. (260 g) corn sugar (for priming)

Step by Step
Mash in with 16 qts. (15 L) water and adjust mash pH to 5.2. Mash at 153 °F (67 °C) for 60 minutes with 3 qts. (3 L) of wort recirculated after 1/2 hour to even out mash temperature. Sparge to give preboil volume of 8.7 gallons (33 L). Boil for 90 minutes, adding hops at indicated time. Cool to 63 °F (17 °C) and pitch yeast. Vigorous fermentation caused temperature to rise to 66 °F (19 °C) over the course of a week. Remove some of the yeast load and condition in fermenter for one more week before bottling. Prime with dextrose to achieve 3.5–4 volumes CO2.

Extract with grains option:
Reduce amount of wheat malt to 8 oz. (0.23 kg) and Pilsner malt to 6 oz. (0.17 kg). Add 1.5 lbs. (0.68 kg) dried wheat malt extract and 4 lb. (1.8 kg) liquid wheat malt extract. Steep grains in 3 qts. (2.8 L) of water at 153 °F (67 °C) for 45 minutes. Combine "grain tea," dried malt extract and water to make 3.5 gallons (13 L) of wort. Boil 60 minutes, adding hops at beginning of boil and liquid malt extract for final 15 minutes of boil. Cool, transfer to fermenter and top up to 6 gallons (23 L). Pitch yeast. Ferment, condition and package as described in all-grain recipe.

Wholly Smoke incorporates a blend of smoked malts to create a rich and complex smoky robust porter. Due to the high percentage of smoked malts this beer is not easily replicated using malt extract.

Ingredients
4.8 lbs. (2.2 kg) Weyermann rauchmalt
4.5 lbs. (2 kg) Maris Otter pale ale malt
1.25 lbs. (0.57 kg) Briess cherrywood smoked malt
1 lb. (0.45 kg) Weyermann oak smoked wheat malt
1 lb. (0.45 kg) crystal malt (45 °L)
1 lb. (0.45 kg) crystal malt (77 or 80 °L)
12 oz. (0.34 kg) chocolate malt
12 oz. (0.34 kg) black patent malt
8 AAU Magnum hops (60 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 16% alpha acids)
2.5 AAU East Kent Golding hops (20 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 5% alpha acids)
White Labs WLP001 (California Ale), Wyeast 1056 (American Ale), or SafAle US-05 yeast
2⁄3 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by step
Mill the grains and mix with 4.4 gallons (16.6 L) of 165 °F (74 °C) strike water to reach a mash temperature of 153 °F (67 °C). Hold this temperature for 60 minutes. Vorlauf until your runnings are clear. Sparge the grains with 2.9 gallons (10.9 L) and top up as necessary to obtain 6 gallons (23 L) of wort. Boil for 90 minutes, adding hops according to the ingredient list.

After the boil, turn off heat and chill the wort to slightly below fermentation temperature, about 65 °F (18 °C). Aerate the wort with pure oxygen or filtered air and pitch yeast.

Ferment at 67 °F (19 °C) for 10 days, then raise the temperature to 70 °F (21 °C) for 3–4 days. Crash the beer to 35 °F (2 °C) for 48 hours and then bottle or keg the beer and carbonate to approximately 2.25 volumes.

Tips for success:
Owner and Brewmaster Julian Shrago notes that this beer is the very definition of a "modern" porter, as it owes its signature flavor to cherrywood smoked malt, a product that was largely unavailable ten years ago. Owing to the high proportion of smoked base malt in this beer, extract versions aren’t advisable, but for those who are all-grain brewers there’s not much to get you into trouble here! The grist is doing most of the hard work, and your additions and fermentation are pretty straightforward.

If you find that the mild roast complexity is getting lost in the smoky background, consider replacing half of the black patent and chocolate malt with the equivalent amount of pale chocolate — you’ll get more flavors out of the more lightly-kilned chocolate malt.

OG = 1.041 (10.2 °P) FG = 1.009 (2.4 °P)
IBU = 35 SRM = 38 ABV = 4.1%

Ingredients

6.0 lb. (2.72 kg) Crisp British Maris Otter pale ale malt
1.75 lb. (794 g) flaked barley
17.0 oz. (482 g) roasted barley (500 °L) (crushed)
7.6 AAU Challenger pellet hops (0.95 oz./27 g at 8% alpha acids)(60 min.)
2.5 AAU Kent Golding pellet hops (0.5 oz./14 g at 5% alpha acids) (15 min.)
White Labs WLP004 (Irish Ale), Wyeast 1084 (Irish Ale) or Fermentis Safale US-05 yeast

Step by Step
Crush the roasted barley very fine. Run it through a coffee mill or use a rolling pin to turn it almost to dust. That is critical to getting the right flavor and color with this recipe. Mill the remaining grains as normal and dough-in targeting a mash of around 1.5 quarts of water to 1 pound of grain (a liquor-to-grist ratio of about 3:1 by weight) and a temperature of 120 °F (49 °C). Hold the mash at 120 °F (49 °C) for 15 minutes then raise the temperature to 148 °F (64 °C) until enzymatic conversion is complete. Raise the temperature to mash out at 168 °F (76 °C). Sparge slowly with 170 °F (77 °C) water, collecting wort until the pre-boil kettle volume is around 6.5 gallons (24.4 L) and the gravity is 1.032 (8 °P).

The total wort boil time is 90 minutes. Add the bittering hops with 60 minutes remaining in the boil. Add Irish moss or other kettle finings and the last hop addition with 15 minutes left in the boil. Chill the wort rapidly to 69 °F (21 °C), let the break material settle, rack to the fermenter, pitch the yeast and aerate thoroughly.

Ferment at 69 °F (21 °C). Slowly raise the temperature during the final 1⁄3 of fermentation by 6 °F (3 °C) to reduce diacetyl levels in the beer. When finished, carbonate the beer to approximately 1 to 1.5 volumes and serve at 52 to 55 °F (11 to 13 °C).

Step by Step
Mill the grains and dough-in targeting a mash of around 1.5 quarts of water to 1 pound of grain (a liquor-to-grist ratio of about 3:1 by weight) and a temperature of 150 °F (66 °C). Hold the mash at 150 °F (66 °C) until enzymatic conversion is complete. Infuse the mash with near boiling water while stirring or with a recirculating mash system raise the temperature to mash out at 168 °F (76 °C). Sparge slowly with 170 °F (77 °C) water, collecting wort until the pre-boil kettle volume is around 6.5 gallons (24.4 L) and the gravity is 1.069 (16.8 °P).

The total wort boil time is 90 minutes, which helps reduce the S-Methylmethionine (SMM) present in the lightly kilned Pilsner malt and results in less Dimethyl sulfide (DMS) in the finished beer. Add the bittering hops with 60 minutes remaining in the boil. Add the second hop addition and Irish moss or other finings with 15 minutes left. Chill the wort rapidly to 53 °F (12 °C), let the break material settle, rack to the fermenter, pitch the yeast and aerate thoroughly. The proper pitch rate is 30 grams of properly rehydrated dry yeast, six packages of liquid yeast or two packages of liquid yeast in a 10-liter starter. Ferment at 53 °F (12 °C) until the beer attenuates fully. With healthy yeast, fermentation should be complete within a week, but do not rush it. Rack to a keg and force carbonate or rack to a bottling bucket, add priming sugar, and bottle. Target a carbonation level of 2 to 2.5 volumes.

Step by Step
Most Munich malt extract is sold as a blend of Munich and Pilsner or two-row malts. I specify 100% Munich liquid malt extract (LME) and Pilsner LME in my recipes so you will know which blends might work best for your brew. If you use a blend, replace both the Munich and Pilsner extracts with 11.9 lb. (5.4 kg) of the blend. If you cannot get fresh liquid malt extract, it is better to use an appropriate amount of dried malt extract (DME) instead.

Mill or coarsely crack the specialty malt and place loosely in a grain bag. Avoid packing the grains too tightly in the bag, using more bags if needed. Steep the bag in about 1 gallon (~4 liters) of water at roughly 170 °F (77 °C) for about 30 minutes. Lift the grain bag out of the steeping liquid and rinse with warm water. Allow the bags to drip into the kettle for 15 minutes while you add the malt extract. Do not squeeze the bags. Add enough water to the steeping liquor and malt extract to make a pre-boil volume of 5.9 gallons (22.3 liters) and a gravity of 1.076 (18.4 °P). Stir thoroughly to help dissolve the extract and bring to a boil.

The total wort boil time is 60 minutes. Add the bittering hops with 60 minutes remaining in the boil. Add the second hop addition and Irish moss or other finings with 15 minutes left. Chill the wort rapidly to 53 °F (12 °C), let the break material settle, rack to the fermenter, pitch the yeast and aerate thoroughly. The proper pitch rate is 30 grams of properly rehydrated dry yeast, six packages of liquid yeast or two packages of liquid yeast in a 10-liter starter. Ferment at 53 °F (12 °C) until the beer attenuates fully. With healthy yeast, fermentation should be complete within a week.

Follow the remaining packaging and carbonation instructions in the all-grain version of this recipe.

IBU = 12 SRM = 3 ABV = 4.8%

Ingredients
6.5 lbs. (3 kg) pale malted barley
2 lbs. (0.91 kg) flaked rice
2.6 AAU Mount Hood hops (60 min.) (0.66 oz./ at 4% alpha acid)
2 AAU Mount Hood hops (5 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 4% alpha acid)
3 Beano® tablets (150 enzyme units per tablet)
1 quart starter of American lager yeast (White Labs WLP840 or Wyeast 2035)
2/3 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Mash in malted barley and flaked rice with 2.75 gallons (10.5 L) of 152 °F (67 °C) water. Resulting mash temperature should be 140 °F (60 °C). Rest at 140 °F (60 °C) for 30 minutes and increase temperature to 150 °F (66 °C). Rest at 150 °F (66 °C) for 30 minutes and increase mash temperature to 158 °F (70 °C). Rest at 158 °F (70 °C) for 45 minutes and then increase temperature to 168°F (76 °C) for mash-off. Transfer mash to lauter tun and allow mash to rest 15 minutes before beginning vorlauf. Recirculate wort until clear and transfer to brew kettle. Begin sparging with 168°F (76 °C) when grain bed has approximately one inch of wort above it. Collect a total of 6 gallons (23 L) of wort.

Bring wort to a boil and add 2.6 AAU of Mount Hood hops. Boil for 55 minutes and add 2 AAU of Mount Hood hops. Boil 5 more minutes and stop boil. Chill wort to 52°F (11 °C) (if possible), aerate well, add yeast starter and Beano® tablets.

Ferment at 52°F (11 °C) until fermentation ends, about 10 to 14 days. Verify final gravity has been achieved with a hydrometer and rack beer to a secondary fermenter. Place secondary in a 38°F refrigerator and hold for one week and then cool refrigerator to 32 °F (0 °C) (if possible). Let beer sit at 32°F (0 °C) for an additional 2 weeks before bottling. Transfer beer to bottling bucket, add 2/3 cup of priming sugar (dissolved in boiling water and cooled before adding), bottle and condition at room temperature for 2 weeks. Alternatively, transfer to a keg, carbonate and enjoy.

Extract Option:
Substitute 4.5 lbs. (2 kg) of pale malt extract for the malted barley and 1.25 lbs. (0.57 kg) rice syrup for the flaked rice. Proceed as above from boil.

OG = 1.054 FG = 1.012
IBU = 32 SRM = 10 ABV = 5.5%

Ingredients
10 lbs. (4.5 kg) pale 2-row malt
1 lb. (0.45 kg) crystal malt (60 °L)
6 oz. (170 g) acidulated malt (optional)
7.5 AAU Magnum hops (60 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 15% alpha acids)
7.5 AAU Centennial hops (10 min.) (0.75 oz./21 g at 10% alpha acids)
1 oz. (28 g) Amarillo® hops (0 min.)
1 Whirlfloc tablet (10 min.)
LalBrew BRY-97 (West Coast Ale), SafAle US-05, or Mangrove Jack’s M44 (US West Coast) yeast
4.7 oz. table sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Mash in with 4 gallons (15 L) of water at 163 °F (73 °C). Rest one hour at 152 °F (67 °C). For simplicity, this recipe uses a batch sparge: Start by running off all the wort into your kettle. Then add 4.5 gallons (17 L) of water at 170 °F (77 °C) to the mash tun, stir, rest 10 minutes, drain the wort. Bring to boil and add hops per schedule while doing a 60-minute boil. After the boil is complete, add the Amarillo® hops and give the wort a long stir to create a whirlpool. Let stand for 10 minutes.

Chill to 68 °F (20 °C), run off to a sanitized fermenter, add yeast (aeration or rehydration not required). Ferment at or near 68 °F (20 °C) for two weeks. At bottling, make a syrup of two cups of water and table sugar, boil, stir gently into wort in bottling bucket to prime. Keep bottles in a warm-ish (room temperature) but dark place for at least 10 days to carbonate. Alternately, if you use 16-oz. (470-mL) PET bottles, you may prime the beer with one standard (3 g) sugar cube per bottle.

LalBrew BRY-97 (West Coast Ale), SafAle US-05, or Mangrove Jack’s M44 (US West Coast) yeast
4.7 oz. table sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
This recipe uses the extract and steep method to produce a concentrated wort. Rehydrate malt extract in 3.5 gallons (13.2 L) of reverse osmosis (RO) or distilled water, bring to a boil, and add Magnum hops at the beginning of the boil. While the reconstituted extract is heating, place the crushed crystal malt in a grain bag and separately steep in 2 quarts (2 L) cool RO or distilled water, which you want to heat to 170 °F (77 °C) and hold for 30 minutes. At 15 minutes remaining in the main boil, remove the grain bag from the steep and drain the liquid from the bag. At 10 minutes remaining, pour the liquid from the steep into the main boil, return to a boil, add the Whirlfloc and Centennial hops, and boil for 10 more minutes. Follow the remainder of the all-grain recipe instructions, being sure to top up the fermenter to 5.5 gallons (21 L) with RO or distilled water prior to pitching yeast.

1.1 lbs. (0.5 kg) Munich 2 malt (9 °L)
1.1 lbs. (0.5 kg) malted oats
0.66 lb. (0.3 kg) pale caramalt (10 °L)
0.66 lb. (0.3 kg) pale chocolate malt
0.33 lb. (0.15 kg) Bairds chocolate malt (500 °L)
0.33 lb. (0.15 kg) black barley (500 °L)
0.22 lb. (100 g) cocoa powder (0 min.)
1.1 lbs. (0.5 kg) lactose sugar (0 min.)
4.4 lbs. (2 kg) raspberry puree (primary)
1.8 oz. (50 g) vanilla extract (primary)
3.5 oz. (100 g) cocoa nibs (primary)
8 AAU Columbus hops (60 min.) (0.6 oz./17g at 15% alpha acids)
Wyeast 1028 (London Ale), White Labs WLP013 (London Ale), LalBrew Nottingham, or an equivalent yeast
2⁄3 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Mashing at a temperature of 154 °F (68 °C) produces a reasonably full body but not so full that it takes away from the drinkability of the beer. Mash for 60 minutes or until converted. Recirculate and sparge with 170 °F (77 °C) water. Boil wort for 60 minutes, adding hops at start of boil and the cocoa powder and lactose in whirlpool.

Chill quickly to 66 °F (19 °C). Be sure that you have plenty of headspace in your fermenter for the raspberry addition. Ferment at 66 °F (19 °C) during active fermentation. When fermentation is about 80% complete, add the raspberry puree, cocoa nibs, and vanilla extract. Raise temperature to 68 °F (20 °C) to ensure raspberry puree ferments out and diacetyl is eliminated. Recommend two weeks at this temperature to ensure yeast are properly finished and flocculated. Bottle or keg and carbonate to 2.4 v/v.

Ingredients
4.37 lbs. (2 kg) extra light dried malt extract
1.3 lbs. (0.6 kg) medium crystal malt (65 °L)
1.1 lbs. (0.5 kg) Munich 2 malt (9 °L)
1.1 lbs. (0.5 kg) malted oats

Wyeast 1028 (London Ale), White Labs WLP013 (London Ale), LalBrew Nottingham, or an equivalent yeast
2⁄3 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Use muslin bags for easy removal of the grain. Put the Munich malt and oats in one bag and the rest of the grains in another. Mash the Munich and malted oats in 3 gallons (11.4 L) of water at 154 °F (68 °C) until converted. During the last 10 or so minutes of the mash, add the second bag containing the rest of the crushed grains. Adding this bag later will still deliver all the flavors without risking too much unneeded astringency from the darker malts. Once the mash is complete, remove the bags, draining the liquid without squeezing the bags. Raise temperature to near boiling and slowly stir in half of the dried malt extract (DME). Return to the heat source and raise to boil. Boil for 60 minutes, adding hops at the beginning, the rest of the DME with 5 minutes remaining, and the cocoa powder and lactose at the end.

Meanwhile, boil and chill about 2.5 gallons (9.5 L) of water so you can add it to the rest of your wort after the boil.

Chill wort quickly to 66 °F (19 °C). Add pre-boiled and chilled water to top up to 5 gallons (19 L). Ferment at 66 °F (19 °C). When fermentation is about 80% complete, add raspberry puree, cocoa nibs, and vanilla extract. While primary will only take a few days, let the beer sit for two full weeks to condition. Raise temperature to 68 °F (20 °C) to ensure raspberry puree ferments out and diacetyl is eliminated. Bottle or keg and carbonate to 2.4 v/v.

Tips For Success:
To create a water chemistry profile similar to that used by Behemoth Brewing, start with a base of reverse osmosis water and make the following additions: 5 g CaCl2, 2.5 g CaS04, and 4 g CaCO3. For the vanilla addition, feel free to substitute chopped up whole beans; 2–3 beans should be plenty. If using extract, just be sure to use real vanilla and not imitation extract.

IBU = 25 SRM = 5 ABV: = 7%

Ingredients
9.9 lb. (4.5 kg) Best Malz Pilsen (or similar continental Pilsner) malt (2 °L)
1.2 lbs. (560 g) cane or beet sugar (0 °L)
7 oz. (200 g) Franco-Belges aromatic malt (20 °L)
7 oz. (200 g) wheat malt (2 °L)
5.6 AAU Hallertau pellet hops (60 min.) (1.4 oz./39 g at 4% alpha acids)
White Labs WLP500 (Trappist Ale) or Wyeast 1214 (Belgian Ale) yeast

Step by Step
Belgian Pilsner malt is the natural choice for the base malt. Feel free to substitute any high quality malt of a similar flavor and color from a different supplier. The sugar I use is the cheapest table sugar I can find at my warehouse store.
Mill the grains and dough-in targeting a mash of around 1.5 quarts of water to 1 pound of grain (a liquor-to-grist ratio of about 3:1 by weight) and a temperature of 150 °F (66 °C). Hold the mash at 150 °F (66 °C) until enzymatic conversion is complete. Infuse the mash with near-boiling water while stirring or with a recirculating mash system raise the temperature to mash out at 168 °F (76 °C). Sparge slowly with 170 °F (77 °C) water, collecting wort until the pre-boil kettle volume is around 6.5 gallons (24.4 L) and the gravity is 1.050 (12.4 °P).

The total wort boil time is 90 minutes, which helps reduce the S-Methyl methionine (SMM) present in the lightly kilned Pilsner malt and results in less Dimethyl Sulfide (DMS) in the finished beer. Add the bittering hops with 60 minutes remaining in the boil. Add the sugar with 15 minutes left in the boil. Chill the wort rapidly to 64 °F (18 °C), let the break material settle, rack to the fermenter, pitch the yeast and aerate thoroughly.

You will need 2 packages of liquid yeast or you can make a 2.5L starter from 1 package. Pitch yeast at 64 °F (18 °C), aerate or oxygenate, and let the temperature rise slowly to 68 °F (20 °C) over the course of several days. Ferment until the yeast drops clear. With healthy yeast, fermentation should be complete in a week, but do not rush it. It is important for the beer to attenuate fully. Rack to a keg and force carbonate or rack to a bottling bucket, add priming sugar, and bottle. When finished, carbonate the beer to approximately 3 volumes.

 Belgian Blond
(5 gallons/19 L, extract with grains)
OG = 1.065 (15.8 °P) FG = 1.012 (3.0 °P)
IBU = 25 SRM = 5 ABV = 7%

Ingredients
6.6 lb. (3 kg) Pilsner liquid malt extract (LME) (2 °L)
1 lb. (0.45 kg) light dried malt extract
1.1 lb. (500 g) cane or beet sugar (0 °L)
7 oz. (200 g) Franco-Belges aromatic malt (20 °L)
5.6 AAU Hallertau pellet hops (1.4 oz./39 g at 4% alpha acids) (60 min.)
White Labs WLP500 (Trappist Ale) or Wyeast 1214 (Belgian Ale) yeast

Step by Step
Try to find a Pilsner-type liquid malt extract made from 100% Pilsner malt, but feel free to substitute any high quality malt extract of a similar flavor and color. If you cannot get fresh liquid malt extract, it is better to use an appropriate amount of dry malt extract (DME) instead, since it does not oxidize nearly as fast and tends to be fresher. The sugar I use is the cheapest table sugar I can find at my warehouse store.

Because it can be tricky to get aromatic malt to convert by itself, you can consider the aromatic malt optional. You can omit it completely or replace it with a few ounces of Munich malt extract. If you do use the aromatic malt, it is best to try and get it to convert in a very simple mini mash. Mill or coarsely crack the aromatic malt and add it to 16 oz (0.5 L) of 158 °F (70 °C) water. Mix the grains until completely moist, and then do your best to keep the temperature between 150 and 160 °F (66 and 71 °C) for 30 minutes to one hour. You can do this by setting the container in a larger pot of hot water or wrapping it in a heating pad set on high. The warmer the temperature, the less time it will take to convert the starches, but don't let it go higher than 160 °F (71 °C) to avoid accidentally denaturing the enzymes in the malt. When done the liquid will taste slightly sweet. If it doesn't taste sweet, it didn't convert. Strain out the grains and rinse with warm water. Add the liquid from the mini mash along with enough water and malt extract to make a pre-boil volume of 5.9 gallons (22.3 L) and a gravity of 1.055 (13.6 °P). Stir thoroughly to help dissolve the extract and bring to a boil. Once the wort is boiling, add the bittering hops. The total wort boil time is 1 hour after adding the bittering hops. Add the sugar with 15 minutes left in the boil. Chill the wort rapidly to 64 °F (18 °C), let the break material settle, rack to the fermenter, pitch the yeast and aerate thoroughly.

IBU = 25 SRM = 30 ABV = 10.5%

We keep the IBUs on the low side for this beer in relation to the style because we like the hops to take a backseat to the rich malt and yeast characters in this beer. The more this beer attenuates and dries out the more the hop flavor will come through in the final flavor.

Ingredients
18 lbs. (4.5 kg) Pilsner malt
0.8 lb. (0.36 kg) Dingeman’s Special B malt
1 lb. (0.45 kg) Belgian candi syrup D-180 (near end of fermentation)
1 lb. (0.45 kg) Belgian candi syrup D-90 (near end of fermentation)
5.6 AAU Premiant hops (60 min.) (0.75 oz./21 g at 7.5% alpha acids)
3.4 AAU Tettnang hops (30 min.) (0.75 oz./21 g at 4.5% alpha acids)
Wyeast 3787 (Trappist Style High Gravity) or White Labs WLP530 (Abbey Ale) or Lallemand Abbaye or Safbrew BE-256 yeast
3⁄4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step

This is a multi-step mash. Mill the grains, then mix with 6.9 gallons (26 L) of 154 °F (72 °C) strike water to reach a mash temperature of 144 °F (66 °C). Hold this temperature for 30 minutes. Raise the mash temperature through infusion of boiling water or recirculating system up to 158 °F (70°C). Hold this temperature for 30 minutes. Raise the mash to mash out at 172 °F (78 °C).

Vorlauf until your runnings are clear, then begin sparge. Sparge the grains with enough water to obtain 7.5 gallons (28.4 L) of wort.

Boil for 120 minutes, adding hops according to the ingredient list. After the boil, whirlpool for 5 minutes, then let settle for 5 minutes. Chill the wort to about 65 °F (18 °C) and then pitch yeast and aerate.

Once fermentation commences, allow beer to free rise up to 70 °F (21 °C). You can hold this temperature for ten days or until the completion of primary fermentation, whichever is later. Add the candi syrups once fermentation begins to slow down. Bottle or keg the beer and carbonate to approximately 2.5 volumes.

Since the hops were only used for bittering in the original, I opted for a high alpha-acid US hop, Columbus, and upped the IBU level a little just to give a round number for the weight of hops used.

Ingredients
12.25 lb. (5.6 kg) 2-row pale malt
2 lb. (0.91 kg) amber malt
2 lb. (0.91 kg) brown malt
0.8 lb. (0.36 kg) black malt
12 AAU Columbus hops (90 mins) (1 oz./28 g at 12.4% alpha acid)
Wyeast 1098 (British Ale) yeast (2 pkts in a 1 qt./1 L starter)
Priming sugar (if bottling)

Step by Step
Mash grains at 152–154 °F (67–68 °C) for 60 to 90 minutes. Sparge one hour, with water no hotter than 175 °F (79 °C) to collect about 6 gallons (23 L). Boil for 90 minutes, with bittering hops added at start. Cool as quickly as possible to 70–75 °F (21–24 °C). Pitch with yeast as a 1 qt. (1 L) starter prepared previously and allow to ferment for five to seven days. Rack to secondary for one to two weeks, then prime with sugar and bottle, or keg in the usual manner.

* Note that one thing I did not mention in the story was the yeast. We know nothing about the yeast used in Ellis’ recipe, but Samuel Whitbread was brewing porter in 1744, so a Whitbread yeast strain is about as authentic as it is possible for us to get.

1744 Porter
(5 gallons/19 L, partial mash)
OG = 1.080 FG = 1.020
SRM = 57 IBU = 46 ABV = 7.9%

We must use brown malt in this so we shall have to do a partial mash along with the extract. You could use 6 lbs. (2.7 kg) light liquid malt extract (LME) in place of 9.25 lbs. (4.2 kg) pale malt, and do a partial mash with 3 lbs. (1.4 kg) pale malt and the amber, brown and black malts. But that means a partial mash of just less than 8 lbs. (3.6 kg) in weight, which I think most homebrewers would find a little too much to handle. I have therefore developed a more suitable recipe, based on an amber malt extract (preferably one made with crystal malt and Munich malt), eliminating the use of amber malt and reducing the amount of brown and black malts.

Ingredients
9.5 lb. (4.3 kg) amber liquid maltextract
1 lb. (0.45 kg) 2-row pale malt
1 lb. (0.45 kg) brown malt
0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) black malt
12 AAU Columbus hops (90 mins)(1 oz./28 g at 12.4% alpha acid)
Wyeast 1098 (British Ale) yeast (2 pkts in a 1 qt./1 L starter)
Priming sugar (if bottling)

Step by Step
Place the crushed grains in a muslin bag, add to 2 gallons (7.6 L) of water at 165 °F (74 °C), and keep at 150–155 °F (66–68 °C) for 30 to 60 minutes. Remove the bag, rinse with hot water two or three times, collecting the runnings in the brew pot. Do not squeeze the bag (see tips for success, below). Add the malt extract, stirring well to ensure it is properly dissolved, then bring to a boil and continue heat for 90 minutes, with bittering hops added at start. Cool as quickly as possible to 70–75 °F (21–24 °C). Pitch with yeast as a 1 qt. (1 L) starter prepared previously and allow to ferment for five to seven days. Rack to secondary for one to two weeks, then prime with sugar and bottle, or keg in the usual manner. If priming, refer to BYO’s priming chart at https://byo.com/resources/
carbonation for guidance.

Tips for Success:
For partial mash brewers, resist squeezing the grain bag. Brew Your Own’s Mr. Wizard, Ashton Lewis, explains that when specialty malts are steeped in a grain bag the grains really do not behave as a filter and trub is not filtered from the wort, as is the case when a mash tun or lauter tun is used to separate spent grains from wort. Nonetheless, some of the trub is retained in the grain bag. By squeezing the grain bag more trub and cloudy wort is moved into the wort. This is why gently rinsing the bag with hot water is suggested instead of squeezing; it also extracts more of the good stuff from the grain bag.

"This was my first Belgian Ale. I had no spare fridge space, so it was fermented at ambient temperatures, getting up to 86°F (30 °C) on day 2 and it was all over after 3 days. I didn't really like the beer, but all who tried it thought it was great, and so did the judges!"

Ingredients
11 lb. 12 oz. (5.3 kg) Weyermann Pilsner malt
3.5 oz. (0.10 kg) Weyermann Pale Wheat malt
3 lb (1.35 kg) demerara sugar

Belgian-Style Saison
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.048 FG = 1.003
IBU = 26.1 SRM = 4ABV = 5.9%

This saison is very dry, with a balanced lemony tartness from the yeast. Flaked wheat adds complexity, body, and smoothness. Rye adds complexity, mainly in the form of spiciness. No aroma hops are used in this version, which focuses on the yeast and grains. For more hop character, I would recommend dry hopping with a noble hop variety or a moderate amount of Motueka and/or Nelson Sauvin.

Ingredients
6.6 lbs. (3 kg) 2-row Pilsner malt
2.2 lbs. (1 kg) flaked wheat
14 oz. (0.4 kg) rye malt
7.4 AAU Hallertau Magnum hops (60 min.) (0.53 oz./15 g at 14% alpha acids)
Wyeast 3726 (Farmhouse Ale) or Wyeast 3724 (Belgain Saison) or starter from the dregs of a bottle of Blaugies beer
1 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
The brewing starts with a 20-minute protein rest performed at 122 °F (50 °C) in 3.5 gallons (13.2 L) of water. At the end of the protein rest, raise mash up to 145 °F (63 °C) to reach the saccharification rest. Maintain the temperature for 75 minutes and before getting to the mash out, make sure to perform an iodine test. This should not be a problem since the amount of unmalted grain is rather limited, but taking extra safety is rarely a bad idea. If the test is negative, bring the mash to 172 °F (78 °C) for 15 minutes. Proceed to vorlauf,with the flow at a moderate speed to avoid a stuck sparge. Sparge with 4.5 gallons (17 L) of water at 172 °F (78 °C).

Bring the wort to a boil and add the bittering hop charge. Maintain the boil for 60 minutes and then proceed to the cooling. Pitch the yeast, aerate, and ferment for four days at 64–68 °F (18–20 °C) or higher if you’re willing to (Blaugies can be fermented at 78+ °F/25+ °C without any trouble). After the initial four days, you can raise the fermentation to 75 °F (24 °C) to help the yeast end fermentation efficiently. Total fermentation usually lasts for 10 to 15 days, depending on the conditions. A maturation of 10 to 15 additional days with stable gravity before cold crashing is highly advised. If you want to add any hop aroma, add a dry hop charge for 4 days before proceeding to the cold crash step. Cold crash at 39 °F (4 °C) for 7–10 days. Bottle or keg as usual.

Extract with Grains Option: Substitute the 2-row pale malt with 7 lbs. 14 oz. (3.6 kg) Briess light liquid malt extract. Place the crushed malts in a steeping bag and steep in 4 qts. (3.7 L) of water at 150 °F (66 °C) for 30 minutes. Pull the grain bag out and drain over the pot in a colander. Rinse the grains with 2 qts. (1.9 L) of water at 170 °F (77 °C). Add water to the pot to make 3 gallons (11 L), add the liquid malt extract and bring to a boil. Add the hops and Irish moss according to the ingredients list.

Tips for success:

The recommended yeast strains in this recipe will get homebrewers close to the taste of Oberon, but because Bell’s house yeast is proprietary, the only way to use the same strain is to culture it from a fresh Bell’s beer. On their website, Bell’s offers these directions for culturing yeast:

• Refrigerate your bottle or can of beer for one week. Make sure you have a nice slurry on the bottom. Two to three bottles or cans will yield better results.

• Open bottle or can and sanitize the lip with a flame. NOTE: You may also want to spray sanitizer on and around the cap before opening.

• Gently pour the beer into a glass, leaving the sediment (yeast) in the bottle or can.

• Swirl the sediment/yeast in the bottle and re-flame the lip.

• Pour sediment into a sanitized container.

• Grow your yeast using a stepped starter – start with 75ML (about 1⁄3 of a cup) of wort, then let ferment for two to three days. Then add an additional 750ML of wort and let ferment an additional two to three days.

Quinannan Falls is a dry-hopped India pale lager that possesses a crisp, dry bitterness you would expect from a German Pilsner, but the use of highly aromatic Simcoe® hops from the Pacific Northwest evoke the fragrant pine forests that inspired this summer seasonal beer from Bell’s.

Ingredients
12 lbs. (5.4 kg) Pilsner malt
1 lb. (0.45 kg) Carapils® malt
13 AAU Simcoe® hops (45 min.) (1 oz./28 g at 13% alpha acids)

3⁄4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Heat 17.3 qts. (16.4 L) of strike water to 163 °F (73 °C). Mix with grains, the mash should stabilize at about 150 °F (66 °C). Hold at this temperature for 75 minutes, then raise temperature to mash out at about 168 °F (76 °C) either by infusion of boiling water, decoction, or other means. Vorlauf until wort runs clear then begin the sparge process. Collect approximately 7 gallons (26.5 L) and bring to a boil. Total boil time is 90 minutes, adding hops as indicated.

After boil is complete, turn off the heat then give a long stir to create a whirlpool. Let wort settle for 10 minutes, then chill the wort to 48–58 °F (9–14 °C). There should be about 5.5 gallons (21 L) of wort in your fermenter. Top fermenter up with cold water if you are short. Aerate wort and add yeast. Place your fermenter in a temperature-stable place that is in the 48–58 °F (9–14 °C) range. On day five of fermentation add the dry hop addition. Conduct a diacetyl rest when fermentation subsides by raising the fermentation temperature to around 70 °F (21 °C) for a couple of days.

Once terminal gravity has been reached, transfer to a secondary fermenter for lagering to get it off the yeast. Place the beer in a refrigerator or cold fermentation chamber to get the beer as cold as possible without freezing. Allow at least two weeks for the lagering period. Bottle or keg after fermentation is complete.

Ingredients
12.17 lbs. (5.52 kg) Maris Otter pale ale malt
3.45 lbs. (1.57 kg) dark Munich malt (30 °L)
0.91 lb. (0.41 kg) dark crystal malt (120 °L)
0.56 lb. (0.25 kg) melanoidin malt
0.56 lb. (0.25 kg) roasted amber malt (43 °L)
7.8 AAU Crystal hops (42 min.) (2.4 oz./68 g at 3.25% alpha acids)
3.25 AAU Crystal hops (27 min.) (1 oz./28 g at 3.25% alpha acids)
White Labs WLP001 (California Ale), Wyeast 1056 (American Ale),
SafAle US-05, or equivalent yeast
¾ cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
In a medium-thick mash, achieve a mash temperature of 150 °F (66 °C). Mash for 40 minutes or until fully converted. Mash out at 170 °F (77 °C) then recirculate until clear. After collecting wort, boil for a total of 54 minutes, adding the hops at 42 and 27 minutes, respectively. If you care to, add yeast nutrient and a Whirlfloc tablet with 10 minutes to go in the boil for yeast health and beer clarity. Whirlpool and let the break and hops settle for 20 minutes at the end of boil for easy transfer.

Chill rapidly to 70 °F (21 °C). Pitch yeast and oxygenate thoroughly. Ferment at 72 °F (22 °C). Being a fairly large beer with a lot of sugars to ferment, give it no less than two weeks for primary and secondary fermentation. A few days longer will not hurt. Keg the beer and carbonate to 2.5 volumes or bottle condition.

Step by Step
This recipe has a combination of grains that can be steeped (crystal 120) and others that need to be mashed (amber, melanoidin, and Munich). Since the crystal 120 is the only steepable grain and imparts no roastiness that might contribute additional unwanted bitterness, you can include it when you mash the others. With grains in a large muslin bag, mash in 3 gallons (11.4 L) of water at 150 °F (66 °C). Mash for 40 minutes or until converted. Upon completion of the mash, remove grains, letting the wort drip.

Raise temperature to a boil and slowly add half of your malt extract. Boil for a total of 54 minutes, adding the hops at 42 and 27 minutes, respectively. If you care to, add yeast nutrient and a Whirlfloc tablet with 10 minutes to go in the boil for yeast health and beer clarity. With 5 minutes remaining, add the remaining LME. Separately, pre-boil and chill about 2.5 gallons (9.46 L) of water so you can top up your fermenter to 5 gallons (19 L) after the boil.

Chill rapidly to 70 °F (21 °C). Pitch yeast and oxygenate thoroughly. Ferment at 72 °F (22 °C). Being a fairly large beer with a lot of sugars to ferment, give it no less than two weeks for primary and secondary fermentation. A few days longer will not hurt. Keg the beer and carbonate to 2.5 volumes or bottle condition.

TIPS FOR SUCCESS:
The large quantity of specialty malts in the grain bill will inherently lead to a less fermentable wort. Bell’s mash profile is aggressive at this duration of time and at that temperature, yielding a well-attenuated beer with good drinkability. Feel free to mash longer to ensure full conversion.

While there are no oats in this recipe, Bell’s Innovation Manager Andy Farrell believes that an addition of flaked oats could potentially enhance the beer. "I would say you can add 5–15% oats if you wanted to soften it up and create your own character of the beer," said Farrell. "The beer was silky to begin with, but oats would enhance that character even more."

10 AAU Fuggle hops (90 min.) (2 oz./57 g at 5% alpha acids)
Wyeast 1099 (Whitbread Ale) or White Labs WLP005 (British Ale) yeast
1⁄2 cup dried malt extract (if priming)

Step by step
Use a single-step infusion mash at 150–152 °F (66–67 °C) for 60 to 90 minutes. Sparge one hour, with water no hotter than 175 °F (80 °C), until 7 gallons (25.6 L) of wort are in the kettle.

Boil 90 minutes, with hops added at the start. Strain, or siphon off from the hops, and adjust wort volume with cold water, and cool to about 70 °F (21 °C). Pitch yeast (to ensure good fermentation, it is best to make a 2–3 quart/liter starter), and allow to ferment until final gravity is reached, usually 5–7 days. Rack into a secondary fermenter. One week later, rack again, prime with dried malt extract, and rack into keg or bottles. Mature the beer 3–6 months for best results.

Place all the milled grains in a muslin bag, add to 2 gallons (7.6 L) of water at 165 °F (74 °C), and keep at 150–155 °F (66–68 °C) for 60 minutes. Remove the bag, rinse with hot water, and combine this water with that from the partial mash. Add the malt extract, stirring well to ensure it is properly dissolved, then bring to a boil. Add hops and boil 90 minutes. Turn off heat, adjust wort volume with cold water, and cool to about 70 °F (21 °C). Pitch with 2–3 qt. (~2–3 L) yeast starter, oxygenate the wort if possible, and allow to ferment.

By 5–7 days, the final gravity should have been reached. At this point, rack into a secondary fermenter. One to two weeks later, rack again, prime with dried malt extract and rack into keg or bottles. Condition for two to three months.

(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.065FG = 1.011
IBU = ~60SRM = 7ABV = 7%

Two Hearted Ale is one of the defining American-style India pale ales. This beer is bursting with aromas ranging from pine resins to grapefruit notes from the use of 100% Centennial hops.

Ingredients
11 lbs. (5 kg) 2-row pale malt
3.25 lbs. (1.5 kg) pale ale malt
0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) caramel malt (40 °L)
12.5 AAU Centennial hops (45 min.) (1.25 oz./35 g of 10% alpha acids)
12.5 AAU Centennial hops (30 min.) (1.25 oz./35 g of 10% alpha acids)
3.5 oz. Centennial hops (dry hop)
White Labs WLP001 (California Ale) or Wyeast 1056 (American Ale) or Safale US-05 yeast
3⁄4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step

Heat 19.6 qts. (18.6 L) of strike water to 163 °F (73 °C). Mix with grains, the mash should stabilize at about 150 °F (66 °C). Hold at this temperature for 60 minutes, then raise temperature to mash out at about 168 °F (76 °C) either by infusion of boiling water, decoction, or other means. Vorlauf until wort runs clear then begin the sparge process. Collect approximately 7 gallons (25.6 L) and bring to a boil. Total boil time is 75 minutes, adding hops as indicated.

After boil is complete, turn off the heat and chill the wort to 68–74 °F (20–23 °C). There should be about 5.5 gallons (21 L) of wort in your fermenter. Top fermenter up with cold water if you are short. Aerate wort and add yeast. Place your fermenter in a temperature-stable place that is in the 68–74 °F (20–23 °C) range. On day five of fermentation, add the dry hops addition. Bottle or keg after 3 days on dry hops.

Step by Step
Mash at 155 °F (68 °C) for 60 minutes. Total boil time is 90 minutes, adding the first wort hops to the brewpot during the sparge phase. Once the wort comes to a boil add the Chinook hops. Wait 85 minutes then add the Northern Brewer hops. After turning off heat, wait five minutes then add the hop stand Cascade addition. Stir the wort vigorously then let settle for 15 minutes before chilling. Ferment at 68 °F (20 °C). Dry hop for seven days before bottling or kegging.

Extract option:
To get the specified level of bitterness, you can either perform a full-wort boil or perform a partial boil and add half the dried malt extract in the final 15 minutes of the boil. Replace all the 2-row pale malt with
8.5 lbs. (3.9 kg) light dried malt extract, added at the beginning of boil (or split if doing partial boil). Steep the cracked crystal malt in the brew water as the water is coming up to a boil. Remove the malt when the water hits about 170 °F (77 °C). The boil and fermentation schedule are the same as the all-grain version.

Ingredients
1 lb. 11 oz. (0.76 kg) Briess Light dried malt extract
3.3 lbs. (1.5 kg) Briess Light liquid malt extract (late addition)
0.75 lbs. (0.34 kg) corn sugar (15 min.)
1.0 lb. (0.45 kg) Pilsner malt
0.75 lb. (0.34 kg) Vienna malt
0.25 lb. (113 g) crystal malt (20 °L)
5.5 AAU Centennial hops (60 min.) (0.45 oz./13 g of 12% alpha acids)
2.5 AAU Willamette hops (15 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g of 5% alpha acids)

1 tsp. Irish moss
Wyeast 1056 (American Ale), White Labs WLP001 (California Ale) or Safale US-05 dried yeast (1.5 qt./~1.5 L yeast starter)
1.0 cup corn sugar (for priming)

Step by Step
Place crushed grains in a nylon steeping bag. In a large kitchen pot, heat 3.0 qts. (2.8 L) of water to 163 °F (73 °C). Submerge grain bag in water and let steep at 152 °F (67 °C) for 45 minutes. (If temperature drops below 148 °F (64 °C), heat to 152 °F (67 °C) again.) While grains are steeping, heat 1.5 qts. (~1.5 L) of water to 170 °F (77 °C) in a sauce pan. Also, begin heating 2 gallons (7.6 L) of water to a boil in your brewpot.

When steeping is done, place a colander over your brewpot and lift the grain bag into it. Pour the "grain tea" through the bag (which will strain out most of the grain bits), then rinse the bag with the 1.5 qts. (~1.5 L) of 170 °F (77 °C) water.

Heat the (roughly) 3 gallons (11 L) of wort in your brewpot to a boil, then stir in dried malt extract. (It will foam a bit, so don’t pour all the extract in at once.)

Bring the wort back to a boil, add the first charge hops and boil for 60 minutes. Add liquid malt extract, Irish moss and flavor hops with 15 minutes left in boil. Add aroma hops at the end of the boil.

After the boil, put a lid on your brewpot and cool the wort (either in a cold-water bath in your sink or with a wort chiller). Cool until the side of the brewpot no longer feels warm. Transfer wort to your fermenter and top up to 5 gallons (19 L) with cool water. Aerate the wort and pitch your yeast.

Ferment at 68 °F (20 °F). When fermentation slows to halt, rack to secondary. Bottle with corn sugar (or keg) one week later.

Berlin Smoothie
Berlin Smoothie
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.032 FG = 1.005
IBU = 0 SRM = 3 ABV = 4%

This take on Berliner weisse forgoes any hop additions and incorporates two fruits not often seen together in beer, but it works beautifully. The blueberries and pineapple add a lovely deep claret color that’s unclassifiable. The OG above is prior to souring. The FG and ABV include the impact of the fruit addition. The SRM is for the base wort/beer pre-fruit addition.

Ingredients
3.3 lbs. (1.5 kg) German Pilsner malt
3.3 lbs. (1.5 kg) pale wheat malt
4 lbs. (1.81 kg) frozen blueberries
4 lbs. (1.81 kg) frozen pineapple
Distilled water
1⁄2 tsp. yeast nutrient (10 min.)
2 Goodbelly StraightShots or 4 Swanson Probiotic L. plantarum capsules
White Labs WLP001 (California Ale) or Wyeast 1056 (American Ale) or SafAle US-05 yeast
3⁄4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Mill the grains and dough-in, targeting a mash of around 1.5 quarts of water per pound of grain (3.1 L/kg) and a temperature of 150 °F (66 °C). Add lactic acid as needed to target a mash pH of 5.2. Hold the mash at 150 °F (66 °C) for 60 minutes. Sparge or mashout and lauter with enough water to yield a total volume of 5 gallons (19 L) of wort.

Heat wort to 180 °F (82 °C) in the brew kettle and hold for 8 minutes to pasteurize. Chill the wort to 95 °F (35 °C). Transfer the chilled wort to a sanitized, purged souring keg. Do not aerate. Add the Goodbelly shots or the inner contents of the Swanson capsules to the keg. Seal the keg and purge with CO2, leaving about 20 PSI of pressure in the headspace after purging.

Allow the L. plantarum to sour the wort for about 48 hours at 95 °F (35 °C), until the pH drops to about 3.5.

After souring, transfer the wort to a boil kettle and add the amount of distilled water expected to boil off over a 60-minute period. Bring to a boil and boil for 60 minutes, adding the yeast nutrient at 10 minutes remaining.

Turn off the heat and chill the wort to 68 °F (20 °C) or slightly cooler. Transfer the cooled wort to a "clean beer" fermenter and then aerate and pitch the yeast. Ferment at 68 °F (20 °C) until gravity is a few points above terminal.

Thaw and crush the fruit. Rack beer into a secondary fermenter on top of the fruit. Ferment for about a week at 68 °F (20 °C), or until the sugars in the fruit are fermented out.

If bottle conditioning, carbonate the beer to around 2.5 volumes of CO2. If kegging, carbonate as high as 3.5 volumes of CO2.

Berlin Smoothie
(5 gallons/19 L, extract only)
OG = 1.032 FG = 1.005
IBU = 0 SRM = 3 ABV = 4%

Ingredients
3.6 lbs. (1.63 kg) Bavarian wheat dried malt extract
4 lbs. (1.81 kg) frozen blueberries
4 lbs. (1.81 kg) frozen pineapple
Distilled water
1⁄2 tsp. yeast nutrient (10 min.)
2 Goodbelly StraightShots or 4 Swanson Probiotic L. plantarum capsules
White Labs WLP001 (California Ale) or Wyeast 1056 (American Ale) or SafAle US-05 yeast
3⁄4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Fill the brew kettle with 5 gallons (19 L) of water. Heat to about 160 °F (71 °C). Turn off heat, add the extract, and stir to dissolve. Heat wort to 180 °F (82 °C) in the brew kettle and hold for 8 minutes to pasteurize.

Chill the wort to 95 °F (35 °C) and follow the remainder of the instructions in the all-grain recipe.

Tips for success:
If souring in a kettle instead of a dedicated souring keg, flood the kettle headspace (if possible) with CO2 and cover as tightly as possible. Keep the kettle close to 95 °F (35 °C).

You can add lactic acid to bring the wort pH to about 4.5 or lower before pitching the L. plantarum. This will make the job easier for the bacteria and improve foam retention. If you don’t have a pH meter, about 8–9 mL 88% lactic acid per 5 gallons (19 L) of wort (starting at 5.2 pH) will be useful and should get you in the ballpark.

Using more L. plantarum than called for can also accelerate the souring process. Also, fresher L. plantarum will work faster than older L. plantarum.

Leaving 20 PSI of pressure in the souring keg’s headspace after purging helps ensure positive pressure to keep the keg sealed, as most of the headspace CO2 is slowly absorbed by the wort. If you do not have a spunding valve, check the keg’s pressure periodically and if the souring keg’s pressure actually increases (unlikely), bleed some of it off using the pressure relief valve.

The Saccharomyces fermentation will be somewhat slowed by the acidity of the wort. This is normal. The yeast is operating under less than ideal conditions (low pH), but will get the job done.

For a more traditional Berliner weisse, hop to 8 IBUs in the boil with any noble hop, skip the fruit addition and the secondary fermentation, and package the beer when it reaches terminal gravity.

7.2 AAU Magnum hops (60 mins) (0.45 oz./13 g of 16% alpha acids)
5 AAU Centennial hops (15 mins) (0.42 oz./12 g of 12% alpha acids)
0.5 oz. (14 g) Cascade hops (0 mins)
1 tsp. Irish moss (15 mins)
Wyeast 1272 (American II) or White Labs WLP051 (American V) yeast (0.5 qt./~0.5 L yeast starter)

    Step Two:
4.0 lbs (1.8 kg) dried malt extract
8 AAU Simcoe hops (60 mins) (0.62 oz./17 g of 13% alpha acids)
4 AAU Ahtanum hops (15 mins) (0.66 oz./19 g of 6% alpha acids)
0.25 oz. (7.1 g) Amarillo hops (0 mins)
1 tsp Irish moss (15 mins)
0.5 oz. (14 g) Cascade hops (dry hops)
0.25 oz. (7.1 g) Amarillo hops (dry hops)
7/8 cup corn sugar (for priming)

Step by Step:

Step One:
Place crushed grains in a nylon steeping bag. In a large kitchen pot, heat 3.0 qts. (2.8 L) of water to 167 °F (75 °C). Submerge grain bag in water and steep at 156 °F (69 °C)for 45 minutes. (If temperature drops below 152 °F (67 °C), heat to 156 °F (69 °C) again.) While grains are steeping, heat 1.5 qts. (~1.5 L) of water to 170 °F (77 °C) in a sauce pan. Also, begin heating 2 gallons (7.6 L) of water to a boil in your brewpot. When steeping is done, place a colander over your brewpot and lift the grain bag into it. Pour the "grain tea" through the bag (which will strain out most of the grain bits), then rinse the bag with the 1.5 qts. (~1.5 L) of 170 °F (77 °C) water.

Heat the (roughly) 3 gallons (11 L) of wort in your brewpot to a boil, then stir in dried malt extract. (It will foam a bit, so don’t pour all the extract in at once.) Bring the wort back to a boil, adding hops and Irish moss at times indicated in ingredient list. Total boil time is 60 minutes.

After the boil, put a lid on your brewpot and cool the wort (either in a cold-water bath in your sink or with a wort chiller). Cool the wort to 68 °F (20 °C). Transfer the post-boil wort — which should be around 2.5 gallons (9.5 L) — to your fermenter, aerate the wort and pitch your yeast.

Step Two:
(16–24 hours after Step One): Bring 3 gallons (11 L) of water to a boil, add dried malt extract and return to a boil. Add hops and Irish moss at times indicated. Cool wort to 68 °F (20 °F) and rack cooled wort into fermenting beer from Step One. (If beer is not fermenting aerate combined wort.) Add water to make 5 gallons (19 L), if needed. Ferment IPA at 68 °F (20 °F). When fermentation slows to halt, rack to secondary, add dry hops and let beer condition for 5 days. Bottle with corn sugar or keg

1868 East India Pale Ale
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.067 FG = 1.015
IBU = 100+ SRM = 6 ABV = 7.1%

Ingredients
14 lbs. (6.4 kg) Maris Otter pale ale malt
51 AAU UK Goldings hops (90 min.) (10.25 oz./0.29 kg at 5% alpha acids)
3 oz. (85 g) UK Goldings hops (dry hop)
White Labs WLP017 (Whitbread Ale) or Wyeast 1099 (Whitbread Ale) or Safale S-04 yeast
2⁄3 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Mash grains with hot water (1.2 qts./lb.) at 150–152 °F (66–67 °C) for 1 hour. Run off and sparge to collect about 6 gallons (23 L) of wort. Bring to a boil and add the bittering hops, boil 90 minutes. Cool to 65–70 °F (18–21 °C) and pitch with yeast, preferably two packs prepared previously as two 1-qt. (1-L) starters. Ferment 5 days, rack to secondary and add the dry hops in a sanitized weighted muslin bag. After 1–2 weeks rack to keg or bottle and prime or carbonate in the usual way.

*This is a lot of hops, which will likely result in loss of wort in the residue when racked. I have used Goldings for this to follow the original as closely as possible. However, it is more practical to replace these with 29 AAU Progress hops (3.6 oz./102 g at 8% alpha acids).

Extract Version:
Simply replace the pale malt in the recipe with 9.3 lbs. (4.2 kg) Maris Otter liquid malt extract. Boil for only 60 minutes — the shorter boil will not materially affect the actual IBU since the figure quoted above is merely a calculation and is probably higher than the actual solubility of iso-alpha-acids. As above, you may find it more practical to replace the Goldings bittering hops with 29 AAU Progress hops (3.6 oz./102 g at 8% alpha acids).

(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.075 FG = 1.011
IBU = 24 SRM = 12 ABV = 8.5%

Ingredients
10 lbs. (4.5 kg) continental Pilsner malt (2 °L)
2.9 lbs. (1.3 kg) Munich malt (8 °L)
1.1 lbs. (0.5 kg) cane or beet sugar (0 °L)
10.6 oz. (0.3 kg) caramel Vienne malt (20 °L)
1.4 oz. (40 g) black malt (500 °L)
5.5 AAU Kent Goldings hops (60 min.) (1.1 oz./31 g at 5% alpha acids)
Irish moss (15 min.)
White Labs WLP072 (French Ale) or White Labs WLP011 (European Ale)
Priming sugar (if bottling)

Step by Step
I currently use Best Malz Pilsen and Munich, but feel free to substitute any high quality malt of the same type and color from a different sup-plier. The black malt and caramel Vienne I use is from Briess. I use the cheapest granular white sugar I can find at the store, sometimes it is cane sugar and sometimes it is beet sugar. My hops are in pellet form and come from Hop Union, Crosby Hop Farm, or Hopsteiner depending on the variety.

Mill the grains and then dough-in targeting a mash of around 1.5 quarts of water to 1 pound of grain (a liquor-to-grist ratio of about 3:1 by weight) and a temperature of 147 °F (64 °C). Hold the mash at 147 °F (64 °C) until enzymatic conversion is complete. With the low mash temperature, you may need to lengthen the rest time to 90 minutes or more to get full conversion. Infuse the mash with near-boiling water while stirring or with a recirculating mash system raise the temperature to mash out at 168 °F (76 °C). Sparge slowly with 170 °F (77 °C) water, collecting wort until the pre-boil kettle volume is around 6.5 gallons (25 L) and the gravity is 1.058.

The total wort boil time is 90 minutes, which helps reduce the S-Methyl Methionine (SMM) present in the lightly kilned Pilsner malt and results in less Dimethyl Sulfide (DMS) in the finished beer. Add the hops with 60 minutes remaining in the boil. Add Irish moss or other kettle finings with 15 minutes left in the boil. Chill the wort to 66 °F (19 °C) and aerate thoroughly. The proper pitch rate is around 260 billion cells, which is approximately 2–3 packages of liquid yeast or one package of liquid yeast in a 0.9 gallon (3.4 L) starter.

Start fermentation around 66 °F (19 °C) and then raise the temperature a few degrees more (70 °F/21 °C) several days into active fermentation. Let the beer ferment until the yeast drops to the bottom and forms a layer. With healthy yeast, this should be complete in ten days or less, but there is no need to rush it. Rack to a keg and force carbonate or rack to a bottling bucket, add priming sugar, and bottle. Target a carbonation level of 2 to 2.5 volumes.

If you decide to add Brettanomyces or other critters, you might want to do it in a secondary fermenter and then package the beer after it has developed the character you desire. At that point, you can rack to a keg and force carbonate or you can add priming sugar and a fresh dose of yeast to carbonate in the bottle. Be careful if you bottle directly from the primary fermenter with Brettanomyces, there could still be significant sugars present and could result in bottle bombs.

(5 gallons/19 L, extract with grains)
OG = 1.075 FG = 1.011
IBU = 24 SRM = 15 ABV = 8.5%

Ingredients
8.8 lbs. (4 kg) Munich liquid malt extract (8 °L)
1.1 lbs. (0.5 kg) cane or beet sugar (0 °L)
10.6 oz. (0.3 kg) caramel Vienne malt (20 °L)
1.4 oz. (40 g) black malt (500 °L)
5.5 AAU Kent Goldings hops (60 min.) (1.1 oz./31 g at 5% alpha acids)
Irish moss (15 min.)
White Labs WLP072 (French Ale) or White Labs WLP011 (European Ale)
Priming sugar (if bottling)

Step by Step
There are many Munich extract blends out there, always choose the freshest extract. If you cannot get fresh liquid malt extract, see if you can find a dried Munich extract instead. Using fresh extract is very important to brewing great beer. The black malt and caramel Vienne I use is from Briess. I use the cheapest granular white sugar I can find at the store, sometimes it is cane sugar and sometimes it is beet sugar. My hops are in pellet form and come from Hop Union, Crosby Hop Farm, or Hopsteiner depending on the variety.

Mill or coarsely crack the specialty malt and place loosely in a grain bag. Steep the bag in about 1 gallon (~4 L) of water at roughly 170 °F (77 °C) for 30 minutes. Lift the grain bag out of the steeping liquid and rinse with warm water. Allow the bag to drip into the kettle. Do not squeeze the bag. Add the malt extract and enough water to make a pre-boil volume of 5.9 gallons (22.3 L) and a gravity of 1.064. Stir thoroughly to dissolve the extract and bring to a boil.

Once the wort is boiling, add the hops. The total wort boil time is 1 hour after adding the hops. Add Irish moss or other kettle finings with 15 minutes left in the boil. Chill the wort to 66 °F (19 °C) and aerate thoroughly. Follow the fermentation and packaging instructions for the all-grain version.

Ingredients
10 lbs. (4.5 kg) Weyermann Beechwood Smoked Barley malt
1 lb. (0.45 kg) Munich II malt (10 °L)
6 oz. (170 g) Carafa® Special III (dehusked)

White Labs WLP830 (German Lager), Wyeast 2124 (Bohemian Lager), or SafLager W-34/70 yeast
¾ cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
This is a two-step infusion mash with a 30-minute rest at 144 °F (62 °C) and a 20-minute rest at 154 °F (68 °C). Mash-in at a ratio of 1.5 qts./lb. (3 L/kg) strike water to grains, withholding three ounces (85 g) of the Carafa® until you begin recirculation (vorlauf). At the end of the second saccharification rest, either raise the mash temperature to mash out at 168 °F (76 °C) or begin the vorlauf process. Sparge with enough water to collect 6.5 gallons (24.6 L) of wort in the kettle.

Boil for 75 minutes adding the first hop addition after 15 minutes and the second with 15 minutes left in the boil.

Once the boil is complete, chill the wort and aerate well if using a liquid yeast strain. Pitch a healthy amount of yeast (we suggest making a yeast starter if using a liquid yeast or two dry yeast sachets) at 48 °F (9 °C), allowing it to rise to 52 °F (11 °C) during the first week of fermentation, then to 58 °F (14 °C) during the second week.

When fermentation is complete, lager/secondary at around 30 °F (-1 °C) for a minimum of nine weeks once terminal gravity is achieved. Carbonate to 2.4 volumes.

Bierstadt Lagerhaus’ Slow Pour Pils clone
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.047 FG = 1.012
IBU = 33 SRM = 3 ABV = 4.5 %

Ingredients
9.0 lbs. (4.08 kg) German Pilsner malt
0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) acidulated malt
4 AAU Hallertau Mittelfrüh hops (first wort hopping) (1 oz./30 g at 4% alpha acids)
4 AAU Hallertau Mittelfrüh hops (70 min.) (1 oz./30 g at 4% alpha acids)
Wyeast 2124 (Bohemian Lager) or White Labs WLP830 (German Lager) or Saflager W-34/70 yeast
3⁄4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
For authenticity, this all-grain recipe employs a step mash coupled with a single decoction. Mill the grains, then mix with 3.0 gallons (11.2 L) of 142 °F (61 °C) strike water to reach a protein rest of 131 °F (55 °C). Hold for 10 min before raising the mash temperature to 144 °F (62 °C). Hold this temperature for 30 minutes. Again, raise the mash temperature to 160 °F (71 °C) and hold there for 40 min. Finally, remove 1⁄3 of your mash, thin, and boil for 10 min before adding the decoction back to the main mash.

Vorlauf until your runnings are clear, and lauter. Sparge the grains with 4.5 gallons (17 L) and top up as necessary to obtain 6.5 gallons (25 L) of wort. Boil for 90 minutes, adding hops at the times indicated. After the boil is complete, perform a 5-minute whirlpool and then rapidly chill the wort to slightly below fermentation temperature, which is 47 °F (8.5 °C) for this beer. Pitch yeast.

Maintain fermentation temperature of 47 °F (8.5 °C) for 3.5 weeks or until the completion of primary fermentation, whichever is later. Then, reduce temperature to 38 °F (3.5 °C) gradually by dropping the temperature one degree every 2 days and rest there for 1 week. Perform a similar drop in temperature until you reach 32 °F (0 °C) and lager for 3-4 weeks. Bottle or keg the beer and carbonate to approximately 2.5 volumes.

OG = 1.050 FG = 1.012
IBU = 33 SRM = 5 ABV = 4.9%

Ingredients
5.5 lbs. (2.49 kg) Pilsen dried malt extract
4 AAU Hallertau Mittelfrüh hops (first wort hopping) (1 oz./30 g at 4% alpha acids)
4 AAU Hallertau Mittelfrüh hops (70 min.) (1 oz./30 g at 4% alpha acids)

3⁄4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Bring 5.0 gallons (18.9 L) of water to a boil. At some point prior to boiling, add the dried extract while stirring, and stir until completely dissolved. Boil for 60 minutes, adding hops at the indicated times left in the boil.

After the boil and whirlpool, rapidly chill the wort to slightly below fermentation temperature, which is 47 °F (8.5 °C) for this beer. Pitch yeast.

Maintain fermentation temperature of 47 °F (8.5 °C) for 3.5 weeks or until the completion of primary fermentation, whichever is later. Then, reduce temperature to 38 °F (3.5 °C) gradually by dropping the temperature one degree every 2 days and rest there for 1 week. Perform a similar drop in temperature until you reach 32 °F (0 °C) and lager for 3-4 weeks. Bottle or keg the beer and carbonate to approximately 2.5 volumes.

Tips for Success:
Aim for a massive 2-L starter (OG = 1.035) to provide enough healthy cells for a strong fermentation; Bierstadt recommends 210 million cells per mL. This will allow you to go cold and slow. They’ve also noticed that when fermenting as cold as they do, the precursors for diacetyl aren’t formed, which allows them to eliminate that step. If you do detect diacetyl in your beer, feel free to perform a D-rest. If you have the ability to capture carbon dioxide in solution via a spunding valve, you can come one step closer to fully replicating their beer. Typically, you can rack off the trub after 2 weeks in primary or when there’s roughly 1 degree Plato remaining of fermentation in order to naturally carbonate. Finally, everything about this beer is centered around patience. Don’t rush the mash protocol and especially don’t rush the fermentation.

Ingredients
3.3 lbs. (1.5 kg) Coopers, light, unhopped, liquid malt extract
1.5 lbs. (0.68 kg) dried malt extract
1 lb. (0.45 kg) 2-row pale malt
21 oz. (0.60 kg) crystal malt (80 °L)
21 oz. (0.60 kg) chocolate malt (350 °L)
10 oz. (0.28 kg) roast malt (450 °L)
5 oz. (0.14 kg) peat-smoked malt
11.7 AAU Nugget hop pellets (60 min.) (0.9 oz./26 g at 13% alpha acids)
1.25 AAU Fuggles hop pellets (15 min.) (0.25 oz./7 g at 5% alpha acids)
0.25 oz. (7 g) Fuggles hops (0 min.)
1/2 tsp. Irish moss (30 min.)\
1/2 tsp. yeast nutrient (15 min.)
White Labs WLP004 (Irish Ale) or Wyeast 1084 (Irish Ale)
¾ cup (150 g) of corn sugar for priming (if bottling)

Step by Step

Steep the crushed grain in 2.5 gallons (9.5 L) of water at 156 ºF (69 ºC) for 30 minutes. Remove grains from the wort and rinse with 2 quarts (1.8 L) of hot water. Add the liquid and dried malt extracts and boil 60 minutes. While boiling, add the hops, Irish moss and yeast nutrient as per the schedule. When the boil is complete, add the wort to 2 gallons (7.6 L) of cold water in the sanitized fermenter and top off with cold water up to 5 gallons (19 L).

Cool the wort to 75 ºF (24 ºC). Pitch your yeast and aerate the wort heavily. Allow the beer to cool to 68 ºF (20 ºC) and then hold at that temperature until fermentation is complete. Transfer to a carboy, avoiding any splashing to prevent aerating the beer. Allow the beer to condition for 1 week and then bottle or keg. Allow the beer to carbonate and age for 2 weeks.

All-grain option:

This is a single-step infusion mash using an additional 8 lbs. (3.6 kg) of 2-row pale malt to replace the liquid and dry malt extracts. Mix all of the crushed grains with 4 gallons (15 L) of 173 °F (78 °C) water to stabilize at 156 ºF (69 ºC) for 60 minutes. Slowly sparge with 175 ºF (79 ºC) water. Collect approximately 6 gallons (23 L) of wort runoff to boil for 60 minutes. Reduce the 60-minute Nugget hop addition to 9.8 AAU (0.7 oz./19.8 g) to allow for the higher utilization factor of a full wort boil.

The remainder of this recipe and procedures are the same as the extract with grains recipe.

3.25 lbs. (1.5 kg) light dried malt extract
14 oz. (0.40 kg) light liquid malt extract (late addition)
2.0 lbs. (0.91 kg) corn sugar (late addition)
1 lb. 13 oz. (0.82 kg) Belgian Pilsner malt
3.0 oz. (85 g) Belgian aromatic malt
6 AAU Cluster hops (60 min.) (0.86 oz./24 g of 7% alpha acids)
1.3 AAU Styrian Golding hops (20 min.) (0.26 oz./7.3 g of 5% alpha acids)
1.3 AAU Styrian Golding hops (10 min.) (0.26 oz./7.3 g of 5% alpha acids)
0.25 oz. (7.1 g) Styrian Golding hops (2 min.)
Wyeast 1388 (Belgian Strong Ale) or White Labs WLP570 (Belgian Golden Ale) yeast (no starter)
1.25 cups corn sugar (for priming)

Step by Step
Place crushed grains in a nylon steeping bag. In a large kitchen pot, heat 3.0 qts. (2.8 L) of water to 163 °F (73 °C). Submerge grain bag in water and let steep at 152 °F (67 °C) for 45 minutes. (When temperature drops below 148 °F (64 °C), heat to 152 °F (67 °C) again.) While grains are steeping, heat 1.5 qts. (~1.5 L) of water to 170 °F (77 °C) in a sauce pan. Also, begin heating 2 gallons (7.6 L) of water to a boil in your brewpot.

When steeping is done, place a colander over your brewpot and lift the grain bag into it. Pour the "grain tea" through the bag (which will strain out most of the grain bits), then rinse the bag with the 1.5 qts. (~1.5 L) of 170 °F (77 °C) water.

Heat the (roughly) 3 gallons (11 L) of wort in your brewpot to a boil, then stir in dried malt extract. (It will foam a bit, so don’t pour all the extract in at once.) Bring the wort back to a boil, add the bittering hops and boil for 60 minutes. Add first charge of Styrian Goldigns with 20 minutes left in boil. Add Irish moss, liquid malt extract and corn sugar with 15 minutes left in boil.

Add remaining charges of hops with 10 minutes and 2 minutes left in the boil.

After the boil, cool the wort (either in a cold-water bath in your sink or with a wort chiller). Cool until the side of the brewpot feels cool to the touch. Transfer wort to your fermenter and top up to 5 gallons (19 L) with cool water. Aerate the wort and pitch your yeast — straight from the package (no starter) — at 65 °F (18 °F). (Expect a lag time of a day or more.)

Put your fermenter somewhere where the ambient temperature is around 72 °F (22 °C) and let the fermentation temperature rise — up to 80 °F (27 °C) is fine — during fermentation. When fermentation stops, wait a day or two, then rack to secondary. Bottle with corn sugar (or keg) a few days later.

If possible, store beer cold (around 40 °F/4.4 °C) after bottle conditioning for a week or so.

Step by step
Make sure to have enough viable yeast to ferment this beer to completion. Two yeast packets made into a starter or two sachets rehydrated according to manufacturer’s instructions are advisable.

Mash grain at 148–150 °F (64–66 °C), using 18 qts. (17 L) water (ratio 1.2 qts./lb., 2.5 L/kg). After a 90-minute mash, run off and sparge with water at about 170 °F (77 °C) to collect 6 gallons (23 L) of wort (SG about 1.062). Bring to a boil, add the hops after about one hour (with 5 gallons/19 L of wort remaining), and boil down to 3.3 gallons (12.5 L).

Cool to about 70 °F (21 °C) and pitch the yeast starter with oxygenation. Ferment 10–14 days at 70 °F (21 °C), rack to secondary for 4 weeks, rack again and leave for 6–8 months. Keg or bottle as usual and age at least a further 6 months.

OG = 1.067  FG = 1.015
IBU = 19  SRM = 17  ABV = 6.9 %

"Traditionally brewed with a 3-hour long boil, using two row carafa and roasted barley malt. This produces a deep copper to brown colored brew. Full bodied, with pronounced malty caramel and roasted malt flavor."

Ingredients
9 lbs. (4.1 kg) Golden PromiseTM pale malt
4.5 lbs. (2 kg) Maris Otter pale malt
2.5 oz. (71 g) Carafa® Special II malt (475 °L)
5.2 AAU UK Golding hop pellets (60 min.) (1.1 oz./31 g at 4.75% alpha acids)
1⁄2 tsp. Irish moss (30 min.)
1⁄2 tsp. yeast nutrient (15 min.)
White Labs WLP001 (California Ale), Wyeast 1056 (American Ale) or Safale US-05 yeast.
3⁄4 cup (150 g) dextrose (if priming)

Step by Step
This is a single step infusion mash. Mix all of the crushed grains with 4.1 gallons (15.5 L) of 172 °F (78 °C) water to stabilize at 155 ºF (68 °C). This is a medium-thick mash using 1.2 quarts of strike water per pound of grain (2.5 L/kg). Mash for 40 minutes then drain approximately 3 qts. (3 L) of wort and boil it separately for one hour to make a syrup. Be careful not to scorch as the mixture thickens (for cleaning reasons). Slowly sparge with 175 °F (79 °C) water. Collect approximately 6 gallons (23 L) of wort runoff. Combine that with your first boiled wort and boil for 120 minutes, adding the hops, Irish moss, and yeast nutrient as per the schedule. After the boil is complete, cool the wort, pitch yeast, and aerate the wort heavily. Ferment at 65 °F (18 °C). Gently transfer to a carboy, avoiding any splashing to prevent aerating the beer. Allow the beer to condition for an additional week. Prime and bottle condition or keg and force carbonate to 2.4 volumes CO2. Allow the beer to age for at least four more weeks to fully develop the flavors.

Partial mash option:
Reduce the Golden PromiseTM pale malt in the all-grain recipe to 3 lbs. (1.4 kg) and replace the Maris Otter pale malt with 3.3 lbs. (1.5 kg) Muntons light, Maris Otter liquid malt extract and 3 lbs. (1.4 kg) Muntons light, dried malt extract. Mash the milled grain in 1.5 gallons (6 L) of water at 155 °F (68 °C) for 30 minutes. Remove grains from the wort and rinse with 2 quarts (2 L) of hot water, then top off to 3 gallons (11.4 L). Boil for 75 minutes. Top up to 6 gallons (23 L), add the liquid and dried malt extracts and boil for an additional 60 minutes. Follow the remaining portion of the all-grain recipe.

Big Island Brewhaus’ Golden Sabbath clone
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.074 FG = 1.009
IBU = 45 SRM = 7 ABV = 8.5%

INGREDIENTS
11 lbs. (5 kg) North American 2-row pale malt
2 lbs. (0.91 kg) Great Western Munich malt (10 °L)
0.5 lb. (227 g) Simpsons caramalt (15 °L)
1 lb. (0.45 kg) macadamia nut honey or mesquite honey
0.42 lb. (190 g) cane sugar
7.15 AAU Galena hops (90 min.) (0.55 oz./16 g at 13% alpha acids)
4.5 AAU Hallertau Mittelfrüh hops (30 min.) (1 oz./28 g at 4.5% alpha acids)
4 AAU Tettnanger hops (0 min.) (1 oz./28 g at 4% alpha acids)
White Labs WLP570 (Belgian Golden Ale), Wyeast 1388 (Belgian Strong Ale), Imperial Yeast B51 (Workhorse), or Mangrove Jack’s M31 (Belgian Tripel) yeast
¾ cup corn sugar (if priming)

STEP BY STEP
Employing a single infusion mash, target a mash temperature of 152 °F (67 °C), rest for 60 minutes or until conversion is complete. Recirculate until clear, then collect wort and boil for 90 minutes. Add first hop addition when boil is achieved, second addition with 30 minutes remaining, sugar with 15 minutes to go, and final hop addition and honey after heat has been turned off. Adding honey during whirlpool helps to retain much of its valued aroma. Give the wort a long stir to create a whirlpool, then let settle for 20 minutes before beginning to chill the wort.

Chill wort to 68 °F (20 °C), pitch yeast, and oxygenate. A big beer like this can take 12–15 days to finish primary fermentation. Maintain a temperature of 68 °F (20 °C) to help maintain a restrained ester profile, while still imparting an overall positive yeast character.

IBU = 45 SRM = 8 ABV = 8.5%

INGREDIENTS
5.8 lbs. (2.6 kg) light or golden light dried malt extract
1 lb. (0.45 kg) Munich dried malt extract
0.5 lb. (227 g) Simpsons caramalt (15 °L)
1 lb. (0.45 kg) macadamia nut honey or mesquite honey
0.42 lb. (190 g) cane sugar
7.15 AAU Galena hops (90 min.) (0.55 oz./16 g at 13% alpha acids)
4.5 AAU Hallertau Mittelfrüh hops (30 min.) (1 oz./28 g at 4.5% alpha acids)

White Labs WLP570 (Belgian Golden Ale), Wyeast 1388 (Belgian Strong Ale), Imperial Yeast B51 (Workhorse), or Mangrove Jack’s M31 (Belgian Tripel) yeast
¾ cup corn sugar (if priming)

STEP BY STEP
Raise 2 gallons (7.6 L) of water to about 152 °F (67 °C) and steep only the caramalt (in a muslin bag) for about 10 minutes. Remove grain, letting the liquid drip back into the pot without squeezing. Remove malt and raise temperature to near boiling. When close, remove from heat source and slowly stir in the dried malt extract, ensuring it is fully dissolved. Place back onto heat source and raise to a boil. Add first hop addition when boil is achieved, second addition with 30 minutes remaining, sugar with 15 minutes to go, and final hop addition in whirlpool. Add honey during whirlpool to get a thorough blend, while retaining much of its aroma.

After a 20-minute kettle rest, chill wort to 68 °F (20 °C) and top up with pre-boiled and chilled water to achieve a total of 5 gallons (19 L). Pitch yeast, and oxygenate. A big beer like this can take 12–15 days to finish primary fermentation. Maintain a temperature of 68 °F (20 °C) to help restrain the ester profile, but still impart positive yeast character.

Tips For Success:
The goal for Golden Sabbath is to achieve a dry finish while showing light honey/caramel/apple nuances with a floral citrus hop accent. According to Thomas Kerns, both Co-Owner and Brewmaster at Big Island, specific malts make all the difference when trying to recreate this beer.

"I recommend a good 2-row to give a solid backbone instead of using a lighter-bodied Pilsner malt," said Kerns. "Also, I recommend using the Great Western Munich for this beer over the European varieties of Munich malt. Great Western imparts more of a dry-toasty character versus the malt sweetness you get from typical German varieties of Munich malt."

The honey you select will be a key part in developing the final nose and flavor of the beer. But sourcing the nutty tasting macadamia nut honey isn’t going to be easy (or cheap) since the Big Island is the main production site of this honey. Mesquite honey from the desert southwestern U.S. is a good alternative with its light molasses character.

Dextrose can be used instead of cane sugar and Citra® hops can be used in place of Galena; brewer’s choice. The sugar or dextrose is used to lighten the body of the beer while adding fermentables. Your SRM may differ from the recipe (can range from 7–12), depending on the type of honey used and/or employing different maltsters for the grain bill.

Big Rock Brewery: Warthog Ale
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.045 FG = 1.011
IBU = 15 SRM = 6 ABV = 4.3%

Warthog Ale is a crossbreed of a British mild ale and an American cream ale. It’s a lighter-bodied beer, with some crystal malt for a bit of a malty flavor and relatively low hop bitterness. The description on the Big Rock Website also states that this beer has some resemblance to British brown ales, with a nutty finish.

Ingredients
8 lbs. 14 oz. (4 kg) 2-row pale malt
0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) crystal malt (40 °L)
3.5 AAU Willamette hops (60 min.) (0.70 oz./20 g at 5% alpha acids)
4 AAU Centennial hops (3 min.) (0.44 oz./12 g at 9% alpha acids)
1 tsp. Irish moss (15 min.)
White Labs WLP007 (Dry English Ale) or Wyeast 1275 (Thames Valley Ale) yeast (1.25 qt./1.25 L yeast starter)
3/4 cup (150 g) dextrose (if priming)

Step by Step
Mash your grains at 151 °F (66 °C) for 45 minutes using 12 qts. (11 L) of mash water. Collect 5 gallons (19 L) of wort and add 1.5 gallons (5.7 L) of water. Boil for 90 minutes, adding hops and Irish moss at times indicated in ingredient list. After the boil, chill the wort rapidly to 68 °F (20 °C). Aerate the wort well and pitch the yeast. Ferment at 68 °F (20 °C). When the beer has reached final gravity, bottle or keg as normal. Age for two weeks before serving.

Partial Mash Option: Scale the 2-row pale malt down to 1.5 lbs. (0.68 kg). Add 1.5 lbs. (0.68 kg) Coopers Light dried malt extract and 3.3 lbs. (1.5 kg) Coopers Light liquid malt extract (late addition). Place the crushed malts in a nylon steeping bag and steep in 3 qts. (2.8 L) of water at 150 °F (66 °C) for 30 minutes. Rinse the grains with 1.5 qts. (~1.5 L) of water at 170 °F (77 °C). Add water to make 3 gallons (11 L), stir in the dried malt extract, and bring to a boil. Boil for 60 minutes, adding the hops at the times indicated in the ingredients list. Add the liquid malt extract and Irish moss with 15 minutes left in the boil. When done boiling, cool the wort, transfer to a fermenter, and top up to 5 gallons (19 L) with cool water. Aerate the wort and pitch the yeast. Follow the remainder of the all-grain recipe.

IBU = 39 SRM = 3 ABV = 5.7%

When I brewed this recipe, I used Wyeast 1098 (British Ale), but upon reflection, Wyeast 1056 (American Ale) would probably have been more authentic; your choice.

Ingredients
6.6 lbs. (3 kg) pale 2-row malt
1.4 lbs. (0.64 kg) flaked corn
1.6 lbs. (0.73 kg) corn sugar (10 min.)
3.5 AAU Cluster hop pellets (first wort hop) (0.5 oz./14 g at 7% alpha acids)
3.5 AAU Cluster hop pellets (90 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 7% alpha acids)
3.5 AAU Cluster hop pellets (60 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 7% alpha acids)
4 g table salt (NaCl)
Wyeast 1098 (British Ale) or Wyeast 1056 (American Ale) yeast
3⁄4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Mash grains and corn flakes at 152 °F (67 °C) with 9.6 qts. (9 L) water for 60 minutes. Run off and sparge to collect 6 gallons (23 L) of wort. Add salt and first portion of hops to kettle with first gallon (4 L) or so of wort. When all wort is in, bring to boil and then add second hop addition. Add the remaining hops and sugar according to the ingredient list. After the boil, cool to 65–70 °F (18–21°C), separate from trub and transfer to fermenter. Pitch with yeast, preferably as 1 qt. (1 L) starter, and ferment 5-7 days. Rack to secondary for 7–10 days, then keg or bottle in the usual manner.

Partial mash version:
Substitute 3.5 lbs. (1.6 kg) pale liquid malt extract and 1.5 lbs. (0.68 kg) pale 2-row malt for the 6.6 lbs. (3 kg) pale 2-row malt in the all-grain version. Replace the 90-minute Cluster hop addition with 4.9 AAU Cluster hop pellets (0.7 oz./20 g at 7% alpha acids) at 60 minutes and add the third hop addition with 30 minutes remaining in the boil.

Mash pale malt and corn flakes at about 152 °F (67 °C) with 3 qts. (2.8 L) water for 30–40 minutes. Run liquid off from the grain bag, rinse grains twice with 3 qts. (2.8 L) hot water. Dissolve the extract in the collected liquid. Add salt and first portion of hops and make to 5 gallons (19 L) with hot water. Bring to boil, add second hop addition, and after 30 minutes boiling add third addition of hops. Boil for a total of 60 minutes, adding the sugar 10 minutes before the end (stir well and be careful of the hot liquid); cool to 65–70 °F (18–21 °C), separate from trub and transfer to fermenter. Pitch with yeast, preferably as 1 qt. (1 L) starter, and ferment 5–7 days. Rack to secondary for 7-10 days, then keg or bottle in the usual manner.

This Italian Pilsner was first brewed in 2018 to introduce the new Eraclea malt at the Weyermann facility in Bamberg, Germany.

Ingredients
8.8 lbs. (4 kg) Eraclea Pilsner malt
1 lb. (450 g) Carafoam® malt
0.3 lb. (136 g) acidulated malt
6.7 AAU Aurora hops (60 min.) (0.84 oz./24 g at 8% alpha acids)
6.7 AAU Bobek hops (10 min.) (1.2 oz./34 g at 5.6% alpha acids)
SafLager W-34/70, Wyeast 2124 (Bohemian Lager), or White Labs WLP830 (German Lager) yeast
¾ cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Mash in at about 1.5 qts./lb. (3.1 L/kg) at 150 °F (66 °C) and hold at this temperature for 60 minutes. Raise temperature to mash out and recirculate for 15 minutes then begin to run off to the kettle. Sparge with enough acidified water to collect 6.5 gallons (26.5 L) and then boil for 60 minutes. Add hops as indicated. You may opt to add a kettle fining and yeast nutrients in the final 15 minutes of the boil.

After the boil is complete, give the wort a long stir and allow break to settle for 10 minutes before beginning chilling process. Chill wort to 51 °F (11 °C) and transfer to the fermenter. If using a liquid yeast strain, aerate the wort well and pitch the yeast. Ferment at 53 °F (12 °C) until signs of fermentation slow. Slowly raise temperature to 59 °F (15 °C) and hold for one week. Dump the yeast or transfer to a purged secondary vessel. Lager near freezing (~36 °F/2 °C) for three weeks, cooling slowly if possible (don’t cold crash). Rack again and then bottle and prime or keg and force carbonate.

Extract with grains version:
Substitute 5 lbs. (2.27 kg) Pilsen dried malt extract and 1 tsp. 88% lactic acid for the Pilsner and acidulated malts in the all-grain recipe.

Place crushed grains in a small muslin bag and steep in 6.25 gallons (23.7 L) water as it heats up to 168 °F (76 °C). Remove grain bag and, off heat, stir in malt extract. Once dissolved, turn heat back on and bring wort to a boil for 60 minutes, adding the first hop addition at the start of the boil. Follow the remainder of the all-grain recipe instructions.

Birra Venezia
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.049 FG = 1.010
ABV = 5.2% SRM = 5 IBU = 32

This Italian Pilsner has an aroma of citrusy lemon balm, herbaceous bergamot, and floral geranium, which are attributable primarily to the late hopping and dry hopping of the brew with both the Spalter descendant Diamant and the Tettnanger descendant Aurum.

Ingredients
9.4 lbs. (4.26 kg) Eraclea Pilsner malt 
0.2 lb. (90 g) Caramunich® I malt
0.14 lb. (65 g) Carafoam® malt
0.2 lb. (90 g) acidulated malt 
4.2 AAU Hallertauer Blanc hops (60 min.) (0.45 oz./13 g at 9.4% alpha acids)
2.8 AAU Hüll Melon hops (30 min.) (0.38 oz./11 g at 7.5% alpha acids
0.25 oz. (7 g) Diamant hops (0 min.)*
0.2 oz. (6 g) Aurum hops (0 min.)*
0.25 oz. (7 g) Diamant hops (dry hop)*
0.2 oz. (6 g) Aurum hops (dry hop)*
SafLager W-34/70, Wyeast 2124 (Bohemian Lager), or White Labs WLP830 (German Lager) yeast
¾ cup corn sugar (if priming)

*Diamant and Aurum are newer hop varieties that are not widely available in small quantities. If you cannot find them, a good substitution for Diamant would be German Saphir, Spalt, or Saaz, and a good substitute for Aurum would be German Tettnanger or German Northern Brewer.See Tips for Success for more on these substitutions.

Step by Step
Mash in moderately thick, at about 1.5 qts./lb. (3.1 L/kg) at roughly 68 °F (20 °C) (if possible). Raise the mash temperature slowly to 151 °F (66 °C) for a 10-minute rest. Raise the mash temperature slowly to 162 °F (72 °C) for a second, 20-minute rest. Raise the mash temperature slowly to 170 °F (77 °C) for a third, 10-minute rest. Recirculate until the runnings are clear and then sparge with enough acidified water to collect 6.75 gallons (25.5 L) in the boil kettle. Bring wort to a boil. Total boil time is 75 minutes, adding the first hop addition after 15 minutes. You may opt to add a kettle fining and yeast nutrients in the final 15 minutes of the boil.

After the boil is complete, add the final hop addition and give the wort a long stir. Allow break to settle for 15 minutes before beginning chilling process. Chill wort to 51 °F (11 °C) and transfer to the fermenter. If using a liquid yeast strain, aerate the wort well and pitch the yeast. Ferment at 53 °F (12 °C) until signs of fermentation slow. Slowly raise temperature to 59 °F
(15 °C) and hold for one week. Dump the yeast or transfer to a purged secondary vessel with the dry hops. Remove hops after three days and lager near freezing (~36 °F/2 °C) for three weeks, cooling slowly if possible (don’t cold crash). Rack again and then bottle and prime or keg and force carbonate.

Extract with grains version:
Substitute 5.3 lbs. (2.4 kg) Pilsen dried malt extract and 1/2 tsp. 88% lactic acid for the Pilsner and acidulated malts in the all-grain recipe.

Start with 6.25 gallons (23.7 L) in the boil kettle. Place crushed grains in a small muslin bag and steep as water heats up to 168 °F (76 °C). Remove grain bag and, off heat, stir in the malt extract and the lactic acid. Once fully dissolved, turn heat back on and bring wort to a boil. Total boil time is 60 minutes adding the first hop addition at the start of the boil. Follow the remainder of the all-grain recipe instructions.

Tips for success:
Some ingredients in this recipe will be difficult to source. Aurum and Diamant are both distributed by BSG, which just brought them to North American in March 2021 and as of the summer are only sold in 2 kg (4.4 lb.) and larger packages. If you can't source some from a brewery or shop that is willing to break them up then your best bet is to substitute hop varieties with similar characteristics. Mike Brennan, the National Sales Manager for BSG Handcraft said Aurum could be subbed with German Tettnanger or German Northern Brewer: "German Northern Brewer tends to have a bit higher concentration of hop essential oils, especially a-caryophyllene (woody/spicy) and b-caryophyllene (pepper/woody/herbal) than Tettnanger. However, Tett is a parent of Aurum so the overlaps work well." For Diamant, he recommends German Saphir, Spalt, and Saaz: "German Diamant’s profile includes citrus/floral/berry notes; Saphir’s citrus/berry overtones fit, as well as Spalt’s citrus/herbal/berry and Saaz’ citrus & spice. Saphir’s total essential oil content (0.8-1.4 ml/100g) is the closest to Diamant’s 1.5-2.0 range."

Eraclea malt can also be harder to find, however it is available to homebrew shops with a BSG account to purchase in 55 lb. (25 kg) bags (similar to other base grains).

Tasting Sensory Evaluations:
This recipe was first brewed in January 2021 specifically for this article. The all-grain recipe was taste-tested by several experts in Germany and Italy: Agostino Arioli, the developer of the original 1996 Tipopils, in Milan commented on the beer; as did Tullio Zangrando, the retired former Technical Director of Birra Moretti in Udine, in the Friuli-Venezia Giulia region of northeastern Italy. A team of tasters under the leadership of Walter König, the General Manager of the German Hop Research Center in Hüll in the Hallertau, and a team under the guidance of Brewmaster Constantin Förtner at the Weyermann Malting Company also judged the beer. Here is a summary of their assessments:

Visually, everybody agreed the beer impresses with its brilliant golden color and firm, creamy, white head. The bouquet reveals a complex of harmonious, inviting hop aromas of citrusy lemon balm, herbaceous bergamot, and floral geranium, which are attributable primarily to the late hopping and dry hopping of the brew with both the Diamant and Aurum. Genetically, these two hops are related to Saaz and have a noble-type alpha-to-oil ratio.

On the palate, the hop aromas intensify next to an emerging, high-quality, medium-intensity bitterness that is well integrated into a mild toffee and straw maltiness. Writes Agostino Arioli, "The bitterness is amazingly balanced, though sharp enough to be irresistible!" Walter König adds, "The malt selection provided a perfect backdrop for the intended hop aromatics; and both are carried into the well-rounded finish, which was floral, dry, and pleasantly resinous."

This "clean tasting" beer (Tullio Zangrando) is "slender and well-balanced, with a classic Pils character" (Walter König). There was only one slight disagreement among the tasters: While the team at the Hop Research Center found the malt to be in ideal balance with the two new hops, Aurum and Diamant, Agostino Arioli "would have liked a bit more of hop flavor and aroma . . . in this fresh, dry-hopped lager," as well as fewer "mature" and more "green" hop notes. To him, the malt profile showed a bit too much "honey character."

Overall, however, based on the tasters’ judgments, this gentle, easy-drinking Birra Venezia was considered true to its cosmopolitan lineage as a spritzy brew with southern German hop aromatics, an elegant bitterness, and a soft, delicate Italian maltiness, which complement each other to form a harmonious blend of exceptional drinkability. Writes Tullio Zangrando, "after the first bottle it was absolutely necessary to open another one!" Agostino Arioli agrees (obviously with a smile) that there is very little in the beer to "eventually restrain me from drinking more than 10 bottles." The team at the Hop Research Center also raved about this Pils, rhapsodizing that it "can transport you in your mind to a warm summer evening in Italy, when you wade ankle-deep into the Mediterranean Sea, with a Birra Venezia in your hand — the height of sensory pleasures."

Step by Step
Two or three days before brew day, make a 1-qt. (1-L) yeast starter, aerating the wort thoroughly (preferably with oxygen) before pitching the yeast.

On brew day, mash the malts at 153 °F (67 °C) in 15 quarts. (14 L) of water, and hold this temperature for 60 minutes. Raise to 168 °F (76 °C) for 15 minutes to mashout. Fly sparge with 168 °F (76 °C) water until 6.5 gallons (25 L) of wort
is collected. Boil the wort for 90 minutes, adding the hops at the times indicated in the schedule.

Once the boil is complete, chill to 80 °F (27 °C). Pitch yeast starter and ferment at that temperature until gravity is stable, which should take about 2 to 4 weeks. Fermenting at 80 °F (27 °C) will produce more character; at cooler temperatures, it’s quite mild for Brett. Prime and bottle condition, or keg and force carbonate to 2.6 volumes.

When I brewed this recipe, I used the British Ale strain from Wyeast, but upon reflection, probably should have used the American Ale strain as being possibly more authentic; your choice.
Ingredients
7 lbs. (3.2 kg) 2-row pale malt
0.6 lb. (0.23 kg) caramel malt (120 oL)
2.6 lbs. (1.2 kg) corn sugar (10 min.)
3.5 AAU Cluster hop pellets (first wort hop) (0.5 oz./14 g at 7% alpha acids)
5.3 AAU Cluster hop pellets (90 min.) (0.75 oz./20 g at 7% alpha acids)
3.5 AAU Cluster hop pellets (60 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 7% alpha acids)
4 g table salt (NaCl)
Wyeast 1098 (British Ale) or Wyeast 1056 (American Ale) yeast
¾ cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Mash grains at 152 °F (67 °C) with 9.6 qts. (9 L) water for 60 minutes. Run off and sparge to collect 6 gallons (23 L) of wort. Add salt and first portion of hops to boiler with first gallon (4 L) or so of wort. When all wort is in, bring to boil and then add second portion of hops. After 30 minutes of boiling add third portion of hops. Boil for a total of 90 minutes, adding the sugar 10 minutes before the end (stir well and be careful of the hot liquid); cool to 65–70 °F (18–21°C), separate from trub and transfer to fermenter. Pitch with yeast, preferably as 1 qt. (1 L) starter, and ferment 5-7 days. Rack to secondary for 7–10 days, then keg or bottle in the usual manner.

Mash the grains in 4.5 gallons (17 L) at 140 °F (60 °C). (This is a somewhat thin mash, compared to most homebrew mashes.) Hold for 15 minutes, then heat to 150 °F (66 °C). Hold 45 minutes, then heat to 170 °F (77 °C) and transfer mash to lauter tun. Collect around 5 gallons (19 L) of wort, add 1.5 gallons (5.7 L) of water and boil for 90 minutes. Add hops at times indicated in ingredient list. Cool wort to 55 °F (13 °C), aerate well and pitch yeast. Ferment at 55 °F (13 °C), then lager at near freezing temperatures. Perform a diacetyl rest (let temperature rise to 60 °F/16 °C for 2–3 days) in between primary fermentation and lagering. With the mash described above, you should achieve a lower FG than that given in the extract recipe. Your all-grain brew should finish around 1.008, yielding a 4.8% ABV beer — the level of alcohol quoted for Bitburger. Bottle condition warm for two days, then lager in bottles at 38–40 °F (3–4 ºC) for four to six weeks.

Extract with Grains Option:
Scale the Pilsner malt down to 1.5 lbs. (0.68 kg). Add 1.5 lbs. (0.68 kg) light dried malt extract and 3.3 lbs. 1.49 kg) light liquid malt extract (late addition). Place the crushed grains in a grain bag and steep in 3 qts. (2.8 L) of water at 148 °F (64 °C) for 45 minutes. Pull the grain bag out and drain over the pot in a colander. Rinse the grain bag with 1.5 quarts (~1.5 L) of water at 170 °F (77 °C). Remove grains, add water to "grain tea" to make 3 gallons (11 L), add dried malt extract and stir well. Bring to a boil. Boil 60 minutes, adding hops at times indicated in the ingredients list. Add liquid malt extract with 15 minutes remaining in the boil. Cool wort to 55 °F (13 °C), transfer to fermenter, and top up to 5 gallons (19 L) with cool water. Aerate wort well and pitch yeast. Follow the remainder of the all-grain recipe.

BJ’s Grand Cru clone
BJ’s Restaurant and Brewery, multiple locations in U.S.
(5 gallons/19 L, extract with grains)
OG = 1.075 FG = 1.015
IBU = 18–22 SRM = 8 ABV = 7.9%

Ingredients
6.6 lbs. (3.0 kg) Briess golden light malt extract syrup
2 lbs. (907 g) crystal malt (15 °L)
2 lbs. (907 g) candi sugar (beet sugar, boil 20 min.)
0.75 oz (21 g) bitter (Curacao) orange peel (5 min.)
0.75 oz (21 g) crushed coriander seeds (5 min.)
5.25 AAU Czech Saaz hops (60 min.) (1.5 oz./42 g of 3.5% Alpha acid)
5.25 AAU Czech Saaz hops (5 min.) (1.25 oz./35 g of 3.5% alpha acid)
White Labs WLP530 (Abbey Ale) or Wyeast 1762 (Belgian Abbey II) or Lallemand Abbaye Belgian Ale yeast
O.75 cup corn sugar (for priming)

Step by Step
Steep the crushed malts in 3 gallons (11 L) of water as the water heats up to 160 ºF (71 ºC). Remove grains from wort, add the malt syrup and bring to a boil. Add the Saaz bittering hops and boil for 60 minutes. Add the candi sugar for the last 20 minutes of the boil. Add the crushed coriander, orange peel, and second addition of Saaz hops for the last 5 minutes of the boil.

Now add the wort to 2 gallons (7.5 L) of cool water in a sanitary fermenter, and top off with cool water to 5.5 gallons (21 L). Cool the wort to 75 ºF (24 ºC), aerate the beer and pitch your yeast. Allow the beer to cool over the next few hours to 68 ºF (20 ºC), and hold at this temperature until the beer has finished fermenting. Dan Pederson recommends holding the beer at 68 ºF (20 ºC) for another 3 days for a diacetyl rest, and then to cool the beer to 32 ºF (0 ºC) for another 3 days to drop the yeast out of suspension and clear the beer. Then bottle and keg your beer and enjoy!

All-grain option: This is a single step infusion mash. Replace the malt syrup with 9.5 lbs. of Belgian Pale malt, for at total of 10 lbs. (4.5 kg) Belgian pale malt, along with the 2 lbs. (907 g) of crystal malt. Mash the two grains together at 152 ºF (67 ºC) for 60 minutes. Collect approximately 7 gallons wort (26 L) to boil for 90 minutes and have a 5.5-gallon yield (21-L). As with the extract version, add the Candi sugar the last 20 minutes of the boil. Lower the amount of the Czech Saaz hops in the first addition of the boil to 1.25 ounces (35 g) to account for higher extraction ratio of a full boil. The remainder of the recipe is the same as the extract.

Blackberry Mead
Blackberry Mead
(5 gallons/19 L)
OG = 1.154 FG = 1.045
ABV = 15.1%

Ingredients
16.7 lbs. (7.6 kg) blackberries
20 lbs. (9.1 kg) orange blossom honey
0.5 oz. (14 g) GoFerm
1.25 tsp. pectic enzyme
1 tsp. potassium bicarbonate
3 packages Lalvin 71B-1122 yeast
16 g Fermaid O
65 mL Super Kleer KC finings
0.28 tsp. potassium metabisulfite

Step by step
Slowly stir honey with 2 gallons (8 L) of warm water, making sure it all dissolves to create the must. Put fruit in a grain bag and mash it slightly, collecting juice as well. Add the whole fruit grain bag and residual juice to the must.

Prepare 150 mL of warm water with GoFerm addition in it and then slowly mix in yeast. Slowly add must to the yeast-GoFerm mixture until you get its temperature within 10 °F (5 °C) of the must. Aerate the must with oxygen and an aeration stone or wand if available. Pitch the yeast-GoFerm mixture into your must and add the pectic enzyme.

When working with whole fruit it can take several hours to get an accurate gravity reading, so after some time has passed, check the gravity. If needed, add a bit more water or honey to get to your target starting gravity and volume. You can optionally aerate a second time at 12 hours using oxygen.

During active fermentation you need to degas the must twice a day using a wine whip or similar device. At each of these occurrences, make sure to also punch the cap down by immersing/rotating the fruit bag so the top of it does not dry out. Add 4 grams of Fermaid O nutrient at 24 hours, 48 hours, 72 hours, and the 7-day point. If you have a pH meter, monitor the pH daily and add a tsp. of potassium bicarbonate (more if needed) if the pH drops below 3.5.

Remove the fruit bag between 7–14 days or when you notice that it is beginning to blanch (turn white). After 2–3 weeks most of the fermentation will be over. At this point, transfer to a secondary to separate the mead from the sediment. Check the gravity with a hydrometer periodically. Which final gravity has been reached, transfer the mead again, and add the Super-Kleer. With fermentation complete, add 0.25–0.5 tsp. of potassium metabisulfite as an antioxidant.

Age for two months. Transfer the mead one final time once it is completely clear. At the 3-month point, the mead is usually quite pleasant to taste, and you can consider bottling or kegging.

Black Pearl Oyster Stout
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain with bivalve mollusks)
OG = 1.052 FG = 1.013
IBU = 37 SRM = 49 ABV = 5.0%

Ingredients
9.0 lbs. (4.1 kg) 2-row pale malt
0.5 lb. (0.22 kg) flaked oats
1.0 lb. (0.45 kg) roasted barley
0.5 lb. (0.22 kg) chocolate malt

4.3 AAU Fuggles hops (20 min.) (0.75 oz./21 g of 5.7% alpha acids)
Wyeast 1084 (Irish Ale) yeast

Step by Step
Mash grains for 45 minutes at 152 °F (67 °C). Boil wort for 120 minutes. Add hops at times indicated. Add oysters and Irish moss with 15 minutes left. Cool wort. Transfer to fermenter, leaving oyster bits behind. (Don’t eat the oysters, they taste terrible.) Aerate, pitch yeast and ferment at 68 °F (20 °C).

Extract with grains option:
Replace 2-row pale malt with 14 oz. (0.40 kg) Briess Light driedmalt extract, 3 lbs. 14 oz. (1.8 kg) Muntons Light liquid malt extractand 2.0 lbs. (0.91 kg) 2-row pale malt. In a 3 gallon (11 L) or larger stock pot, heat 1.6 gallons (6 L) of water to 163 °F (73 °C). Place crushed grains and flaked oats in a large steeping bag and submerge bag in this hot water. Maintain temperature at 148–153 °F (64–67 °C) for 45 minutes. While grains mash, heat one gallon (3.8 L) of water to 170 °F (77 °C).

Remove grain bag from steeping pot and place in colander over stock pot. Rinse grains with 0.75 gallons (2.8 L) of water from brewpot. Combine "grain tea" and dried malt extract with remaining hot water in brewpot and heat to a boil. Boil 60 minutes, adding hops at times remaining indicated in recipe. With 15 minutes left in the boil, add liquid malt extract, oysters and Irish moss.

Stir thoroughly to dissolve extract. (Keep the clock running even though it will take a few minutes for the wort to resume boiling.) Cool wort and transfer to fermenter, leaving oyster bits behind. Add water to make 5 gallons (19 L). Aerate, pitch yeast and ferment at 68 °F (20 °C).

21st Amendment Brewery and Ninkasi Brewing Company: Allies Win the War clone
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.072 FG = 1.018
IBU = 49 SRM = 23 ABV = 7.1%

This collaboration English strong ale came to be thanks to 21st Amendment's Shaun O'Sullivan and Ninkasi's Jamie Floyd, who had been friends since brewing together in the 1990s at Steelhead Brewery. Both brewers had won GABF medals for their versions of this style, and decided to brew one together using local ingredients.

Ingredients
11 lb. 12 oz. (5.3 kg) 2-row pale malt
12 oz. (0.34 kg) English crystal malt (15 °L)
12 oz. (0.34 kg) English crystal malt (45 °L)
12 oz. (0.34 kg) English crystal malt (120 °L)
8 oz. (0.23 kg) English crystal malt (155/165 °L)
12 oz. (0.34 kg) light Munich malt (6 °L)
1.6 oz. (45 g) chocolate malt
6 oz. (170 g) dates (macerated, in the secondary)
8.4 AAU Warrior hops (90 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g of 16.8% alpha acids)
7.0 AAU Willamette hops (30 min.) (0.9 oz./26 g of 7.8% alpha acids)
0.6 oz. (17 g) East Kent Golding hops (0 min.)
Wyeast 1968 (London ESB) or White Labs WLP002 (English Ale) yeast (3.3 qt./3.3 L yeast starter)
2/3 cup (133 g) dextrose (if priming

Step by Step
For the mash, you will need 4.5 gallons (17 L) of strike water. Mash at 155 °F (68 °C) for 50 minutes. Mash out to 168 °F (76 °C) and hold for 5 minutes. Recirculate and then collect enough wort that you can boil it down to 5 gallon (19 L) in 90 minutes. Boil wort for 90 minutes, adding hops at times indicated in ingredient list. Chill wort and transfer to fermenter. Aerate well and pitch sediment from yeast starter. Ferment at 68 °F (20 °C). Rack to secondary and add dates. Bottle or keg after 5 days in secondary.

Extract with grains option:
Substitute the 2-row pale malt in the all-grain recipe with 2.5 lbs. (1.1 kg) light dried malt extract and 5 lbs. (2.3 kg) light liquid malt extract. Place grains in a large steeping bag. In a large (at least 6 qts./6 L) kitchen pot, steep grains at 155 °F (68 °C) for 50 minutes in 3.9 qts. (3.7 L) of water. Begin heating at least 3 gallons (11 L) of water in your brewpot as the grains steep. Rinse grains with 2 qts. (1.9 L) of 170 °F (77 °C) water and add "grain tea" to water in brewpot. Stir in dried malt extract and bring wort to a boil. Boil for 60 minutes, adding hops at times indicated. Stir in liquid malt extract during the final 15 minutes of the boil. Follow the remaining portion of the all-grain recipe.

Tips for Success:
This recipe contains a lot of specialty grains, including a high percentage of dark crystal malts and some chocolate malt. Darkly roasted grains are, of course, very flavorful, but they are also more likely to give up an excessive amount of tannins if handled improperly. Be careful not to oversparge when collecting wort. If you have a pH meter, monitoring the final runnings and ensuring they don’t climb above 5.8 would be a good idea. Also, be sure to make a yeast starter. This yeast strain has a tendency to flocculate early if the pitching rate is too low.

11.5 lbs. (5.2 kg) Belgian 2-row malt
15 oz. (0.41 kg) rye malt
7.2 oz. (0.21 kg) caramel crystal malt (40 °L)
7.2 oz. (0.21 kg) flaked oats
6.8 oz. (0.19 kg) Carafa® II malt
5.0 oz. (0.14 kg) chocolate malt
1 tsp. Irish moss (10 min)

9.1 AAU Centennial hops (60 min.)(0.91 oz./26 g at 10% alpha acids)
14 AAU Centennial hops (30 min.)(1.4 oz./40 g at 10% alpha acids)
0.45 oz. (13 g) Centennial hops (0 min.)
1.4 oz. (39 g) Simcoe® hops (dry hop)
Safale US-05 yeast

Step by Step
Mash with a liquor-to-grist ratio of 1.25 qts./lb. (2.6 L/kg). Single step infusion mash at 154 °F (68 °C) for 60 minutes. Two-batch sparge at 168 °F (76 °C). The total preboil wort is 6.4 gallons (24 L). Boil for 75 minutes. Ferment until airlock activity has dropped off but not stopped, ~7–10 days, as you want the fermentation to produce enough CO2 in the secondary to blow off the oxygen in the headspace. Rack to a secondary fermenter along with 1.4 oz. (39 g) of Simcoe® whole hops (no bag) for 14 days. Let the beer condition for another week in the secondary. Bottle or keg to 2.5 volumes CO2. Recipe scaled from 11 gallons (41 L) and adjusted to 65% extract efficiency.

Step by Step
Add all the crushed grains into a large muslin bag and place in 2 gallons (7.6 L) water and hold at 154 °F (68 °C) for 60 minutes. Raise the grain bag out of the water and place in a colander. Slowly wash the grains with 1 gallon (4 L) hot water. The total pre-boil wort is 6.4 gallons (24 L). Boil for 75 minutes. Ferment at 68 °F (20 °C) until airlock activity has dropped off but not stopped, ~7–10 days, as you want the fermentation to produce enough CO2 in the secondary to blow off the oxygen in the headspace. Rack to a secondary fermenter along with 1.4 oz. (39 g) of Simcoe® whole hops (no bag) for 14 days. Let the beer condition for another week in the secondary. Bottle or keg to 2.5 volumes CO2.

2 lbs. (0.91 kg) pale malt
0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) dark crystal malt (90° L)
0.25 lb. (113 g) Carafa® Special III malt
0.25 lb. (113 g) dark Munich malt (20° L)
5 lbs. (2.27 kg) light dried malt extract
8 AAU Northern Brewer hops (50 min.) (1 oz./28 g at 8% alpha acid)
8 AAU Northern Brewer hops (20 min.) (1 oz./28 g at 8% alpha acid)
8 AAU Northern Brewer hops (5 min.) (1 oz./28 g at 8% alpha acid)
Wyeast 2112 (California lager) or White Labs WLP810 (San Francisco Lager) yeast
7/8 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Heat 1 gal. (3.8 L) of water to 165 °F (74 °C). Crack grains and mash in. Hold mash at 154 °F (68 °F) for 60 min. Wash grains with 2 gal. (7.6 L) of 168 °F (76 °C). Add dried malt extract to kettle and bring to a boil. Total boil is 50 min. Add first round of hops and boil 30 min. Add second round of hops, boil 15 min. more. Add the rest of the hops, boil 5 min. more, and remove from heat. Chill the wort, then add to your primary fermenter along with enough water to make up 5.25 gal. (20 L). Cool to 70 °F (21 °C), aerate well, and pitch yeast culture. Ferment between 65 °F and 70 °F (18 to 21 °C) for five to eight days, rack to secondary, and chill to 55 °F to 60 °F (13 to 16 °C). Lager for two weeks, then prime and bottle or keg and force carbonate.

All-grain version:
Increase pale malt to 11.5 lbs. (5.2 kg), mash water to 4 gal. (15.2 L) and sparge water to 5 gal (19 L). Follow the same mash schedule and temperatures as above, but plan your boil and hop schedule to reduce kettle contents to 5.25 gal (20 L).

Extract with grains version:
Steep crystal and black malts in 3 gal. (11 L) of water, raising heat in kettle to 170 °F (77 °C). Remove grains and stir in 5 lbs. (2.27 kg) light dry malt and 1.25 lbs. (0.57 kg) Munich dried malt extract. Boil and hop as above.

Yeast:
Although the California lager strain is a very warm-tolerant lager strain, it is still best not to ferment too warm. Some ale-like fruitiness is desirable, but it’s easy to overdo. Begin fermentation warm and gradually cool the fermenter down. A short lagering stage will finish off the beer without drying it out excessively, and will help clarify it.

A note on packaging: I may be a heretic, but I prefer bottled homebrew to kegged. Some brews, including this one, just seem more balanced, more alive from the bottle than from a keg. The live yeast continues to contribute flavor compounds in the bottle and keeps the beer fresher tasting for a longer time. Also, the natural carbonation from bottle conditioning adds a smoothness that can’t be matched by force carbonation (unless you want to get into a nitro mix setup!). This style of beer needs to be relatively highly carbonated, so if you are going to keg it, adjust your pressure accordingly.

Step by Step
Mill the grains and dough-in targeting a mash thickness that will enable your system to achieve the necessary pre-boil volume and gravity. Hold the mash at 153 °F (67 °C) until enzymatic conversion is complete. Infuse the mash with near boiling water while stirring or with a recirculating mash system raise the temperature to mash out at 168 °F (76 °C). Sparge slowly with 170 °F (77 °C) water, collecting wort until the pre-boil kettle volume is around 5.9 gallons (22.3 L) and the gravity is 1.054 (13.4 °P).

The total wort boil time is 60 minutes. Add the first hop addition once the wort starts boiling. Add Irish moss or other kettle finings and the second hop addition with 15 minutes left in the boil. Add the last hop addition at flame out. Chill the wort to 67 °F (19 °C) and aerate thoroughly. The proper pitch rate is 2 packages of liquid yeast or 1 package of liquid yeast in a 2.4-liter starter.

Ferment at 67 °F (19 °C) until the yeast drops clear. At this temperature and with healthy yeast, fermentation should be complete in about one week. Allow the lees to settle and the brew to mature without pressure for another two days after fermentation appears finished. Rack to a keg and force carbonate or rack to a bottling bucket, add priming sugar, and bottle. Target a carbonation level of 2.5 volumes.

Step by Step
Mill or coarsely crack the specialty malt and place loosely in a grain bag. Avoid packing the grains too tightly in the bag, using more bags if needed. Steep the bag in about 1.5 gallon (~6 liters) of water at 165 °F (74 °C). The idea is that your temperature, once you add the grain, is in the malt conversion range and will convert some of the starch from the Munich malt. After about 30 to 60 minutes, lift the grain bag out of the steeping liquid and rinse with warm water. Allow the bags to drip into the kettle for a few minutes while you add the malt extract. Do not squeeze the bags. Add enough water to the steeping liquor and malt extract to make a pre-boil volume of 5.9 gallons (22.3 L) and the gravity is 1.054 (13.3°P). Stir thoroughly to help dissolve the extract and bring to a boil.

The total wort boil time is 60 minutes. Add the first hop addition once the wort starts boiling. Add Irish moss or other kettle finings and the second hop addition with 15 minutes left in the boil. Add the last hop addition at flame out. Chill the wort to 67 °F (19 °C) and aerate thoroughly. The proper pitch rate is 2 packages of liquid yeast or 1 package of liquid yeast in a 2.4-liter starter. Follow the remainder of the all-grain recipe at left.

To duplicate the authentic slightly sour tang of this style, using the Belgian liquid yeast strain is recommended. There are no finishing hops so that the aroma and character of the spices and yeast can surface. The best results can be obtained from the coriander by buying the whole seed and grinding it fresh on brew day. A complex and refreshing treat to savor in any season.

Ingredients
4 lbs. (1.8 kg) dried wheat malt extract
1 lb. (0.45 kg) extra light dried malt extract
1 lb. (0.45 kg) unmalted wheat
0.5 lb. (.23 kg) rolled oats
0.5 lb. (.23 kg) Belgian Pilsner malt
9 AAU Hallertauer hops (boiling) (2 oz./57 g of 4.5% alpha acids)
8.5 AAU Hersbrucker hops (boiling) (2 oz./57 g of 4.25% alpha acids)
0.5 oz. (14 g) sweet orange peel
0.5 oz. (14 g) ground coriander
Munton's Dry Ale dry or Wyeast 3944 (Belgian Witbier) liquid yeast
0.75 cups corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Place the crushed grains into three strainer bags. The rolled oats should go in a separate bag. If using leaf hops, place the boiling hops in a strainer bag. Also place the orange peel and freshly ground coriander into a strainer bag. Pellet hops need not be placed in bags, as they will not be strained out later.

Pour 2 1/2 gallons (9.5 L) of water into the kettle. Add the grain bags to your kettle and bring the water almost to a boil. Remove the kettle from heat and let it sit for 10 minutes. Carefully remove the grain bags and place them into a strainer over the kettle. Rinse the grain bags with one quart (1 L) of hot water into the kettle and dispose of the spent grains.

Add the malt extract to the kettle and stir until it is completely dissolved. Place the kettle back on the burner and bring it to a boil. Once a vigorous boil has been achieved, add the boiling hops. Time the boil for one hour from this point. After a full hour of boiling, remove the kettle from heat and add the bag of spices.

Cover the kettle and let it cool for 20 minutes before continuing. Carefully remove the spice bag (and any hop bags) from the kettle and place them in a strainer over the fermenter. Pour 2 1/2 gallons (9.5 L) of very cold water through the strainer into the fermenter. Add the contents of the kettle to the cold water in the fermenter. Top up the fermenter to 1 inch (2.5 cm) over the 5-gallon (19 L) mark with cold water.

Preparing the yeast: For dry yeast, use 1/4 cup warm water (95 to 105 °F/35 to 41 °C). Sprinkle the contents of the yeast packet into the water without stirring and cover while the fermenter cools to 80 °F (27 °C). For liquid yeast, prepare one to three days ahead of brewing time per package instructions.

All-grain option: Swap out the malt extracts with 3 lbs. (1.4 kg) Belgian wheat malt and 4 lbs. (1.8 kg) Belgian Pilsner malt. Mash for 1 hour at 150 °F (66 °C). Everything else stays the same.

OG = 1.050 (12.4 °P) FG = 1.011 (2.8 °P)
IBU = 20 SRM: 4 ABV = 5.0%

Ingredients
4.5 lb. (2 kg) flaked wheat (1 °L)
4.9 lb. (2.2 kg) Pilsner malt (1.6 °L)
1.1 lb. (0.5 kg) flaked oats (1 °L)
0.25 lb. (113 g) Munich malt (8 °L)
0.5 lb. (227 g) rice hulls or other natural filter
4 AAU Hallertau hops (60 mins) (1.0 oz/28 g of 4% alpha acids)
1.5 oz. (43 g) fresh citrus zest (5 mins)
0.4 oz. (11 g) crushed coriander seed (5 mins)
0.03 oz. (1 g) dried chamomile flowers (5 mins)
Wyeast 3944 (Belgian Witbier), White Labs WLP400 (Belgian Wit Ale) or Brewferm Blanche dried yeast
1 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Mill the grains (including the flaked grains, but excluding the rice hulls). Mix the rice hulls into the grain post milling and dough-in targeting a mash of around 1.5 quarts of water to one pound of grain (a liquor-to-grist ratio of about 3:1 by weight) and a temperature of 122 °F (50 °C). Hold the mash at 122 °F (50 °C) for 15 minutes then raise the temperature over the next 15 minutes to 154 °F (68 °C). Hold until conversion is complete, about 60 to 90 minutes. Raise the temperature to mash out at 168 °F (76 °C). Sparge slowly with 170 °F (77 °C) water, collecting wort until the pre-boil kettle volume is around 6.5 gallons (25 L) and the gravity is 1.039 (9.7 °P).

The total wort boil time is 90 minutes, which helps reduce the SMM present in the lightly-kilned Pilsner malt and results in less DMS in the beer. Add the bittering hops with 60 minutes remaining and the spices with five minutes left in the boil. Do not bother with Irish moss or other kettle finings. Chill the wort rapidly to 68 °F (20 °C), let the break material settle, rack to the fermenter and aerate thoroughly.

Pitch ten grams of properly rehydrated dry yeast or use two liquid yeast packages. Alternatively make a 2 qt. (2 L) starter using one package of liquid yeast. Begin fermentation at 68 °F (20 °C) slowly raising temperature to 72 °F (22 °C) by the last one-third of fermentation. When finished, carbonate the beer to approximately 2.5 to 3 volumes of CO2.

Ingredients
5.5 lb. (2.5 kg) wheat liquid malt (4 °L)
0.25 lb. (113 g) Munich liquid malt extract (9 °L)
1.0 lb. (0.45 kg) Pilsner malt (1.6 °L)
1.13 lb. (0.51 kg) flaked oats (1 °L)
4 AAU Hallertau hops (60 min.) 1.0 oz./28 g of 4% alpha acids)
1.5 oz. (43 g) fresh citrus zest (5 min)
0.4 oz. (11 g) crushed coriander (5 min)
0.03 oz. (1 g) dry chamomile flowers (5 min)
Wyeast 3944 (Belgian Witbier), White Labs WLP400 (Belgian Wit Ale) or Brewferm Blanche dried yeast
1 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Mill the grains (including the oats) and place loosely in a grain bag. The oats will swell, so avoid packing them too tightly in the bag. Use more bags if needed. Steep the bag in 2 gallons (~8 L) at a temperature of 154 °F (68 °C) for about 60 minutes. Lift the grain bag out of the steeping liquid and rinse with warm water. Allow the bags to drip into the kettle for a few minutes while you add the malt extract. Do not squeeze the bag. Add enough water to the steeping liquor and malt extract to make a pre-boil volume of 5.9 gallons (22 L) and a gravity of 1.043 (10.6 °P). Stir thoroughly to help dissolve the extract and bring to a boil.

Once the wort is boiling, add the bittering hops. The total wort boil time is one hour after adding the bittering hops. Do not bother with Irish moss or other kettle finings. Add the spices with five minutes remaining. Chill the wort rapidly to 68 °F (20°C), pitch the yeast and aerate thoroughly. Follow the fermentation and packaging instructions for the all-grain version.

Step by Step
In this extract recipe, the oats are not going to provide any sugars for fermentation so the amount of malt extract is greater than the other recipes. Place the oats loosely in a grain bag. Since the oats will swell, avoid packing them too tightly in the bag. Use more bags if needed. Steep the bag in 2 gallons (~8 L) of 170 °F (77 °C) water for about 30 minutes. Lift the grain bag out of the steeping liquid and rinse with warm water. Allow the bags to drip into the kettle for a few minutes while you add the malt extract. Since this is only oats, squeeze the bags to extract the liquid. Add enough water to the steeping liquor and malt extract to make a pre-boil volume of 5.9 gallons (22 L) and a gravity of 1.043 (10.6 °P). Stir thoroughly to help dissolve the extract and bring to a boil.

Once the wort is boiling, add the bittering hops. The total wort boil time is one hour after adding the bittering hops. Do not bother with Irish moss or other kettle finings.

2.1 AAU German Hallertau hops (55 min.) (0.55 oz./16 g at 3.8% alpha acids)
49 oz. (1.4 kg) blood orange purée
1⁄2 tsp. yeast nutrient (10 min.)
White Labs WLP300 (Hefeweizen Ale), Wyeast 3068 (Weihenstephan Weizen), or SafAle WB-06 yeast
7⁄8 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Mill the grains and dough-in, targeting a mash of around 1.5 quarts of water per pound of grain (3.1 L/kg) and a temperature of 154 °F (68 °C). Hold the mash at 154 °F (68 °C) for 60 minutes. Mash out or begin recirculation, then sparge with enough water to yield a total volume of 5 gallons (19 L) of post-boil wort.

Boil for 70 minutes, adding hops and yeast nutrient as indicated. Chill wort to 70 °F (21 °C) and transfer to a sanitized fermenter. Do not oxygenate beyond incidental splashing. Pitch yeast and ferment at 70 °F (21 °C), adding the orange purée at high kräusen.

When final gravity has stabilized, package and carbonate the beer to 2.8 volumes of CO2.

Extract with grains option:
Replace the Pilsner and pale wheat malts with 5.9 lbs. (2.7 kg) Bavarian wheat dried malt extract. Bring 4.7 gallons (17.8 L) of water, plus the amount of water expected to boil off in 60 minutes, to a boil.

Remove the kettle from heat and stir in the dried malt extract. Return to a boil. Boil for 60 minutes. Follow the remainder of the all-grain recipe.

Tips For Success:
• If controlling mash chemistry, target a pH of about 5.3.

• Add rice hulls to the mash, or have some on hand, in case of a stuck lauter.

• If kegging, consider backsweetening in the keg with 12 fl. oz. (350 mL) of frozen orange juice concentrate.

21st Amendment Brewery’s Back in Black clone
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.066 FG = 1.014
IBU = 65 SRM = 30 ABV = 6.8%

21st Amendment was ahead of the curve with Back in Black IPA. First brewed in 2008, it was one of the first IPAs using dark malts to boost IPA character without sacrificing hops flavors.

"Black IPAs or Cascadian Dark Ales were really not the norm back then and we wanted to create a unique IPA with dark malt character," O’Sullivan says.

They describe their year-round black IPA as, "Inspired by Paul Revere’s midnight ride, we rebelled against the British style IPA, embraced the more aggressive American version and then recast it in bold, brave, defiant black. Our Black IPA is a Declaration of Independence from the tyranny of the expected. Brewed like an American IPA but with the addition of rich, dark malts, this beer has all the flavor and hop character you expect with a smooth, mellow finish."

Ingredients
11 lbs. (4.8 kg) 2-row pale malt
1.25 lbs. (0.57 kg) light Munich malt (6 °L)
12 oz. (28 g) Caramunich® II malt (45 °L)
12 oz. (28 g) Carafa® Special III malt
13.8 AAU Columbus hops (55 min.) (1 oz./28 g at 13.8% alpha acids)
18.4 AAU Centennial hops (0 min.) (2 oz./57 g at 9.2% alpha acids)
17.3 AAU Columbus hops (0 min) (1.25 oz./35 g at 13.8% alpha acids)
2 oz. (57g) Centennial hops (dry hop)
2 oz. (57g) Chinook hops (dry hop)
White Labs WLP001 (California Ale) or Wyeast 1056 (American Ale) or Safale US-05 yeast
3⁄4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Mill the grains and mix with 4.5 gallons (10.6 L) of 162 °F (72 °C) strike water to reach a mash temperature of 150 °F (65.5 °C). Hold the mash at this temperature for 60 minutes until ezymatic conversion is complete. Vorlauf until your runnings are clear. Sparge the grains with enough water to collect 6.5 gallons (24.6 L) of wort. Boil the wort for 60 minutes, adding hops according to the ingredient list.

After the boil, turn off the heat, add the final addition of hops, and begin a vigorous whirlpool in the kettle. Let the hot wort stand for 20 minutes, then chill the wort to slightly below fermentation temperature, about 65 °F (18 °C). Aerate the wort with pure oxygen or filtered air and pitch the yeast.

Ferment at 67 °F (19 °C) for 7 days. Add the dry hops and raise the temperature to 72 °F (22 °C) for five more days. Once the beer reaches terminal gravity, rack to a keg and force carbonate or rack to a bottling bucket, add priming sugar, and bottle. Target a carbonation level of 2.5 volumes. You may want to cold-crash the beer prior to packaging to 35 °F (2 °C) for 48 hours to improve its clarity.

Tips for Success:
If you don’t normally brew with some of the darker roasted grains that are required for brewing a black IPA, it’s not a bad idea to get a city water report (or have one done if you have a well or spring) on your homebrewery’s water source to find out how much carbonate you have. Dark grains will lower the pH of the mash/wort (increase acidity), so you may want to add a little bit of calcium carbonate to your water to counteract. If you add calcium carbonate, 1 tsp. per 5 gallons/19 L is a good rule of thumb to follow. The goal is to keep your mash in the 5.2 to 5.4 range pH range.

Blueberry Porter

Blueberry Porter
(5 gallons/19 L, extract with grains)
OG = 1.051 FG = 1.013
IBU = 26 SRM = 30 ABV = 5.1%

Ingredients
0.25 lb. (113 g) chocolate malt
0.25 lb. (113 g) black patent malt
0.5 lb. (113 g) crystal malt (60 °L)
5.5 lbs. (2.5 kg) dark dried malt extract
4 lbs. (1.8 kg) whole frozen blueberries
4 AAU Challenger hops (60 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 8% alpha acid)
2.5 AAU Fuggle hops (30 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 5% alpha acid)
2.75 AAU Mt. Hood hops (10 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 5.5% alpha acid)
Lallemand Nottingham or Wyeast 1728 (Scottish Ale) or White Labs WLP007 (Dry English Ale) yeast
2/3 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
In 2.5 gals. (9.5 L) cold water, steep chocolate, black patent, and crystal malts. Heat water slowly, remove grains near 160 °F (71 °C), and wash grains with a quart (1 L) of hot tap water. While off heat, add to kettle the dark dried malt extract. Stir carefully until fully dissolved, then bring to a boil. Add Challenger hops and boil 30 minutes. Add Fuggle hops and boil 20 minutes more. Add Mt. Hood hops and boil 10 minutes more. Cool and top off to 5.25 gals. (20 L) with pre-boiled, chilled water. At 68 °F (20 °C), pitch yeast. Ferment six to 10 days at about 65 °F (18 °C). Rack into secondary onto blueberries. Condition at about 55 to 60 °F (13 to 16 °C) for 10 to 14 days, then rack into a keg or bottling bucket. Bottle or keg as usual.

All-grain brewers:
Replace dried malt extract with 8 lbs. (3.6 kg) two-row pale malt, 0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) wheat malt, 0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) Munich malt and 0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) brown malt. Also increase the chocolate malt to 0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) and the crystal malt to 1 lb. (0.45 kg). Mash in 15 qts. (14.2 L) water at 149 °F (65 °C) for 60 minutes. Sparge grains as normal and continue with boil and fermentation schedule as above.

Yeast:
I really like a clean and neutral yeast strain for this porter, one that seems to reinforce the dark malts without making them seem harsh. There should be virtually no diacetyl and no other noticeable esters produced. Other yeast strains such as Wyeast 1968 or WLP002 will do.

Fruit:
Obviously, this brew is a seasonal one for me. Those of you not within fresh blueberry territory will have to make do with frozen blueberries from your grocery store. Four pounds of our local berries (the size of chick peas, roughly) give a noticeable blueberry flavor and aroma, even in a porter. I know of a Maine brewer who has used my recipe and only needed three pounds of the famous wild Maine berries (smaller than elderberries but oh so sweet and flavorful) to achieve the same degree of "blue." If you do get fresh berries, my advice is to freeze them in bags for the length of the primary fermentation and then microwave them to thaw and partially sanitize them. The skins will break open and the juice will flow. Blueberry aroma will dissipate quickly if the berries are in the active fermentation, so you will always get a more aromatic brew by putting them into the secondary fermenter. Blueberry essences and blueberry juice concentrate could be used in a pinch, but they're not the same.

(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.076 FG = 1.023
IBU = 32 SRM = 46 ABV = 7.4%

Ingredients

5 lbs. (2.3 kg) North American 2-row pale malt
5 lbs. (2.3 kg) Maris Otter pale ale malt
1 lb. (0.45 kg) flaked barley
1 lb. (0.45 kg) chocolate malt (350 °L)
12 oz. (0.34 kg) crystal malt (80 °L)
12 oz. (0.34 kg) roasted barley
12 oz. (0.34 kg) flaked wheat
4 oz. (113 g) black patent malt
1 lb. (0.45 kg) lactose sugar (15 min.)
7 AAU Millenium hops (60 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 14% alpha acids)
2.25 AAU Fuggle hops (60 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 4.5% alpha acids)
2.25 AAU Fuggle hops (30 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 4.5% alpha acids)
0.15 oz. (4.3 g) cinnamon sticks (10 min.)
2.5 oz. (71 g) cocoa nibs (secondary)
1.25 oz. (35 g) dried Ancho chili peppers (secondary)
3 vanilla beans (secondary)
White Labs WLP001 (California Ale), Wyeast 1056 (American Ale) or Safale US-05 yeast
2⁄3 cup (133 g) dextrose (if priming)

Step by Step

Mill the grains and mix with 4.5 gallons (17 L) of 164 °F (73 °C) strike water to reach a mash temperature of 152 °F (67 °C). Hold this temperature for 60 minutes. Vorlauf until your runnings are clear. Sparge the grains with 3.5 gallons (13.2 L) and top up as necessary to obtain 6 gallons (23 L) of wort. Boil for 60 minutes, adding hops, lactose sugar and cinnamon sticks according to the ingredient list. After the boil, turn off heat and chill the wort to slightly below fermentation temperature, about 65 °F (18 °C). Aerate the wort with pure oxygen or filtered air and pitch yeast. Ferment at 68 °F (20 °C) for 7 days, then drop the temperature to 60 °F (16 °C) for 24 hours. Add the cocoa nibs, Ancho peppers, and vanilla beans, and age for 5–7 days. Crash the beer to 35 °F (2 °C) for 48 hours. After aging the spice addition, bottle or keg the beer and carbonate to approximately 2.25 volumes.

Partial mash option:
Reduce the 2-row pale malt in the all-grain recipe to 2.5 lbs. (1.13 kg) and add 5 lbs. (2.3 kg) Maris Otter liquid malt extract. Bring 2.2 gallons (8.3 L) of water to approximately 164 °F (73 °C). Place milled grains in grain bags and submerge in the water for 60 minutes. The temperature of the mash should stabilize at about 152 °F (67 °C). After 60 minutes, remove the grain bags, and let drain fully. Wash the grains with about 1 gallon (4 L) hot water, then top off to 6 gallons (23 L) in your brew kettle. Add liquid extract while stirring, and stir until completely dissolved. Boil 60 minutes. Follow the remaining portion of the all-grain recipe.

Tips for Success:
Mexican Radio adds some complexities to the average stout, in the form of a number of spice additions at two points in the production process. Add the cinnamon in the boil just as you would a hop addition, but add the cocoa nibs, vanilla, and Ancho peppers in secondary to limit the amount of oil extraction; to account for the head-killing oils that do get into the beer, the recipe includes a significant addition of flaked wheat and barley to aid in head retention. To prepare the vanilla (go with cheap beans, since the subtleties and nuance of more expensive vanilla will be lost in this beer — but don’t use extract!) and peppers, slice lengthwise before adding to the secondary to increase surface area and impact on flavor. You might also consider a vodka tincture, and just add the entire product to the beer! Finally, keep an eye on water. With so much roasted grain, astringency and acidity are a real concern. Consider the addition of a buffer if your water profile is lacking it naturally. 1⁄4 to 1⁄2 tsp. of baking soda in the mash (especially for the partial mash recipe) may be a good idea if you are using soft water.

Tips for Success:
One of the keys to brewing both of the malty beer recipes here (the recipe on this page, as well as Great Scot on the facing page) is making sure you pitch enough healthy yeast. Pitching a single packet of yeast into a 5-gallon (19-L) batch does not always give your beer enough yeast cells to efficiently ferment the wort. Beers made from underpitched worts start slower, and this slow start can leave the wort open to the growth of microorganisms such as bacteria or wild yeast. Consider making a yeast starter a day ahead of your brew day to generate a healthy population of yeast before pitching. A general rule of thumb for pitching ale yeast is that you need one million (1.0 x 106) cells per milliliter of wort per degree Plato. Visit https://byo.com/yeaststarter for more information about making a yeast starter, as well as a table for recommended starter sizes for a variety of worts. Visit www.mrmalty.com for a useful pitching rate calculator (as well as more malty brewing tips).

IBU = 40 SRM = 4 ABV = 5.3%

Ingredients
10.75 lb. (4.8 kg) Durst continental Pilsner malt (or similar) (2 °L)
0.75 lb. (340 g) Briess Carapils® malt (or similar) (2 °L)
4.83 AAU Czech Saaz hops (60 min.) (1.38 oz./39 g at 3.5% alpha acids)
5.8 AAU Czech Saaz hops (30 min.) (1.67 oz./47 g at 3.5% alpha acids)

White Labs WLP800 (Pilsner Lager), Wyeast 2001 (Pilsner Urquell H-Strain) or Fermentis Saflager S-23 yeast

Step by Step
Mill the grains and dough-in targeting a mash of around 1.5 quarts of water to 1 pound of grain (a liquor-to-grist ratio of about 3:1 by weight) and a temperature of 154 °F (68 °C). Hold the mash at 154 °F (68 °C) until enzymatic conversion is complete. Infuse the mash with near boiling water while stirring or with a recirculating mash system raise the temperature to mash out at 168 °F (76 °C). Sparge slowly with 170 °F (77 °C) water, collecting wort until the pre-boil kettle volume is around 6.5 gallons (25 L) and the gravity is 1.044 (10.9 °P).

The total wort boil time is 90 minutes, which helps reduce the SMM (S-methyl methionine) present in the lightly-kilned Pilsner malt and results in less DMS (Dimethyl Sulfide) in the finished beer. Add the first hop addition with 60 minutes remaining in the boil. The other hop additions are at 30, 10, and zero minutes left in the boil. Add Irish moss or other kettle finings with 15 minutes left in the boil.
Chill the wort to 50 °F (10 °C) and aerate thoroughly. The proper pitch rate is 20 grams of properly rehydrated dry yeast, four packages of liquid yeast or one package of liquid yeast in a 9-liter starter.
Ferment around 50 °F (10 °C) until the yeast drops clear. With healthy yeast, fermentation should be complete in two weeks or less, but don’t rush it. Cold fermented lagers take longer to ferment than ales or lagers fermented at warmer temperatures. If desired, perform a diacetyl rest during the last few days of active fermentation.
Rack the finished beer to a keg and force carbonate or rack to a bottling bucket, add the priming sugar, and bottle. Target a carbonation level of 2 to 2.5 volumes.
A month or more of cold conditioning at near freezing temperatures will mellow some of the flavors and improve the beer. Serve at 43 to 46 °F (6 to 8 °C).

Step by Step
Making an extract version of this beer couldn’t be easier if you have access to Briess Pilsen malt extract. The Briess Pilsen extract contains both Pilsner malt and Carapils®. Use an appropriate amount of dried extract if you can’t get the liquid version. If you can’t get Briess extract, any fresh, high quality light color extract made from Pilsner malt will work well. Always choose the freshest extract that fits the beer style.
Add enough water to the malt extract to make a pre-boil volume of 6.5 gallons (25 L) and the gravity is 1.044 (10.9 °P). Stir thoroughly to dissolve the extract and bring to a boil.
The total wort boil time is 90 minutes. Add the first hop addition with 60 minutes remaining in the boil. The other hop additions are at 30, 10, and zero minutes left in the boil. Add Irish moss or other kettle finings with 15 minutes left in the boil.
Chill the wort to 50 °F (10 °C) and aerate thoroughly. The proper pitch rate is 20 grams of properly rehydrated dry yeast, four packages of liquid yeast or one package of liquid yeast in a
9-liter starter.
Ferment around 50 °F (10 °C) until the yeast drops clear. With healthy yeast, fermentation should be complete in two weeks or less, but don’t rush it. Cold fermented lagers take longer to ferment than ales or lagers fermented at warmer temperatures. If desired, perform a diacetyl rest during the last few days of active fermentation.
Rack the finished beer to a keg and force carbonate or rack to a bottling bucket, add the priming sugar, and bottle. Target a carbonation level of 2 to 2.5 volumes.
A month or more of cold conditioning at near freezing temperatures will mellow some of the flavors and improve the beer. Serve at 43 to 46 °F (6 to 8 °C).

Step by Step
Adjust water chemistry for a dark beer. (If using reverse osmosis or distilled water, add 1 tsp. chalk, 1⁄2 tsp. gypsum and 1⁄4 tsp. calcium chloride per 6 gallons/23 L of brewing liquor). Mash grains at 153 °F (67 °C) in 17 qts. (16 L) of water for 45 minutes. Boil wort for 60 minutes, adding hops at times indicated. Add rice extract with 15 minutes remaining and whirlfloc tablets for final 5 minutes of the boil. Whirlpool wort for 5 minutes before chilling. (Skipping this step will lower the bitterness of your beer.) Cool wort, aerate well and pitch yeast. Ferment at 62 °F (17 °C). When fermentation is complete, dry hop for four to seven days and bottle or keg as normal.

Step by Step
Mill the grains, then mix with 3.5 gallons (13.2 L) of 162 °F (73 °C) strike water to reach a mash temperature of 151 °F (66 °C). Hold this temperature for 60 minutes. Sparge grains with enough water to collect 6.5 gallons (24.6 L) of wort. Boil for 90 minutes, adding hops according to the ingredient list.

After the boil, remove from heat and add the final hop addition. Give the wort a long stir to create a whirlpool and let settle for 20 minutes. Chill the wort to about 68 °F (20 °C). Aerate the wort with pure oxygen or filtered air and pitch yeast.

Ferment at 68 °F (20 °C) for four days, then raise the temperature towards the end of attenuation. Add the dry hops and wait 4 days before packaging.

Bonneville Flats Bitter
(5 gallon/19 L, partial mash)
OG = 1.040 FG = 1.009
IBU = 27 SRM = 9 ABV = 4.0%

Ingredients:
0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) Briess Light dried malt extract
3.3 lbs. (1.5 kg) Alexander’s Pale liquid malt extract (late addition)
0.5 lbs. (0.23 kg) corn sugar
1.5 lbs. (0.68 kg) 2-row pale ale malt
0.25 lbs. (0.11 kg) crystal malt (30 °L)
0.25 lbs. (0.11 kg) crystal malt (40 °L)
1 tsp. Irish moss (15 mins)
1/8 tsp. yeast nutrients (15 mins)
6.4 AAU First Gold hops (45 mins) (0.8 oz./23 g of 8% alpha acids)
2.0 AAU First Gold hops (15 mins) (0.25 oz./7 g of 8% alpha acids)
0.75 oz. (21 g) First Gold hops (0 mins)
2 pkg. Nottingham dried yeast (rehydrated)
0.75 cups corn sugar (for priming)

Step by Step
Make your brewing water by combining 6 gallons (23 L) of soft, distilled or RO water with 1.5 tsp. gypsum. Steep grains in 2.0 qts. (1.9 L) of this water at 158 °F (70 °C). Steep for 30 minutes, then rinse with 1.0 quart (0.94 L) of water at 170 °F (77 °C). Add dried malt extract, corn sugar and water to make 2.0 gallons (7.6 L) of wort and bring to a boil. Once initial foaming subsides, add bittering hops and boil for 45 minutes. Do not let the wort volume dip below 2.0 gallons (7.6 L) during the boil. Add boiling water to make up volume if this happens. With 15 minutes left in boil, turn off heat and stir in liquid malt extract, Irish moss and flavor hops. Stir until extract is dissolved, then resume heating. (Keep the boil clock running.)

Add aroma hops at end of boil. Cool your 2 gallons (7.6 L) of wort (in sink or with chiller). Once cool, let sit (covered) for 15 minutes. Transfer wort to fermenter, leaving the majority of the sediment in brewpot behind. Add water to make 5 gallons (19 L), aerate and pitch yeast. (Rehydrate yeast — in a clean, sanitized measuring cup — as described on package.) Ferment at 72 °F (22 °C) until fermentation is complete — about 3 days, when I brewed it. Taste small sample. If you don’t taste diacetyl, rack the beer directly to keg or bottling bucket. If kegging, force carbonate beer for 3 days at around 30 PSI. When done, release pressure from keg and adjust regulator to proper dispensing pressure for your system. If bottling, keep bottles warm (74–80 °F/23– 27 °C) for five to six days, then chill in refrigerator for two to three days before opening.

This easy-drinking hoppy ale features a balanced bitterness and aroma with a slight caramel malt character.

Ingredients
8.25 lbs. (3.7 kg) British pale ale malt
0.25 lbs. (113 g) amber malt
4 AAU Australian Topaz hop pellets (60 min.) (0.25 oz./7 g at 16% alpha acids)
2.5 oz. (71 g) Cascade hop pellets (0 min.)
1.5 oz. (43 g) Citra® hop pellets (0 min.)
1.5 oz. (43 g) Mosaic™ hop pellets (0 min.)

0.25 oz. (7 g) Centennial hop pellets (dry hop)
1⁄2 tsp. Irish moss (30 min.)
Wyeast 1098 (British Ale), White Labs WLP007 (Dry English Ale), Safale S-04, Mangrove Jack’s M07 (British Ale), or Lallemand Nottingham Ale yeast.
2⁄3 cup (133 g) dextrose (if priming)

Step by Step
This is a single step infusion mash, mashing at 154 °F to 156 °F (68 °C to 69 °C) to create a fuller bodied beer. Mix all the crushed grains with 3.5 gallons (13 L) of 170 °F (77 °C) water and stabilize the mash at 156 °F (68 °C) for 60 minutes. Raise the mash temperature to 165 °F (74 °C) and sparge with enough 175 °F (79 °C) water to collect approximately 6 gallons (23 L) of wort. Boil the wort for 60 minutes. Add the first hop addition of Topaz at the beginning of the boil and the Irish moss for the last 30 minutes. Turn off the burner and add the first Cascade, Mosaic™, and Citra® hop additions and stir to mix in. After about three to four minutes, begin using your wort chiller to drop the temperature of the wort to 170 °F (77 °C) and hold for 15 minutes. Then chill to yeast-pitching temperature. When you reach about 80 °F (27 °F), strain the wort into a fermenter. Aerate the wort and pitch the yeast. Ferment at 68 °F (20 °C). When fermentation is complete, rack the beer off the trub, add the dry hop additions and dry hop for four days. Bottle or keg as usual.

Extract with grains option:
Substitute the British pale ale malt in the all-grain recipe with 3.3 lbs. (1.5 kg) Briess light liquid malt extract and 2 lbs. (0.9 kg) Briess light dried malt extract. Steep the crushed amber malt in 2.5 gallons (9.5 L) of water at 155 °F (68 °C) for 30 minutes. Remove the grains from the wort and rinse as you top your brew pot up to 5.5 gallons (21 L). Add the malt extracts and boil for 60 minutes. Follow the remaining portion of the all-grain recipe.

(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.071 FG = 1.007
IBU = 38 SRM = 4 ABV = 8.5%

Tank 7 has become one of Boulevard’s most recognized brands and a terrific example of a modern saison. The recipe got its start as a riff on Saison, a brand in the Smokestack Series, when Pauwels was working on Saison Brett. The Smokestack Saison recipe was tweaked to boost the strength from 7.5% to 8.5% ABV and the beer was dry-hopped with Amarillo® hops, which were relatively new at the time. The brewers were tasting the base for Saison Brett from Fermenter #7, coincidentally a 300-barrel Mueller fermenter built in Springfield, Missouri by the author’s former employer, and really dug what they were tasting. The "clean version" of Saison Brett (essentially Tank 7 bottle-conditioned with Brett and other conditioning yeast) became Tank 7 and the rest is history.

White Labs WLP002 (English Ale) or Wyeast 1968 (London ESB) or Lallemand London ESB Ale yeast
3/4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Mash the grains at 152 °F (67 °C) for 60 minutes. Vourlaf until runnings are clear, and sparge. Collect approximately 6 gallons (22.7 L) of wort runoff to boil for 60 minutes. Add the hops, Irish moss, and yeast nutrient at the times indicated in the ingredients list. Stir in the brown sugar at the end of the boil. Chill the wort to 75 °F (24 °C), aerate the wort heavily, and pitch your yeast. Allow the beer to cool to 68 °F (20 °C). Hold at that temperature until fermentation is complete. Transfer to a carboy, avoiding any splashing to prevent aerating the beer. Allow the beer to condition for 1 week and then bottle or keg. Allow to carbonate and age for 2 weeks.

Extract with Grains option:
Omit the 2-row pale malt. Add 3.3 lbs. (1.5 kg) Muntons light, unhopped, malt extract and 1.8 lbs. (0.81 kg) light dried malt extract. Steep the crushed grains in 2 gallons (7.6 L) of water at 152 °F (66.7 °C) for 30 minutes. Pull the grain bag out and drain over the brew pot in a colander. Rinse with 2 quarts (1.9 L) of hot water. Add the liquid and dried malt extracts and bring to a boil. While boiling, add the hops, yeast nutrients, and Irish moss as per the ingredients list. Stir in the brown sugar at the end of the boil. After the boil, cool the wort and transfer it to a sanitized fermenter. Top off with cold water up to 5 gallons (19 L), aerate well, and pitch the yeast. Follow the remainder of the all-grain recipe.

283 Kilometers (European Pale Lager)
283 Kilometers
(5 gallon/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.047 FG = 1.009
IBU = 22 SRM = 5 ABV = 4.9%

Ingredients
5.0 lbs. (2.3 kg) Vienna malt
5.0 lbs. (2.3 kg) Pilsner malt
6 AAU Tettnang hops (60 mins) (1.5 oz./43 g of 4% alpha acids)
1 tsp. Irish moss (15 mins)
1/4 tsp. calcium chloride (90 mins)
Wyeast 2124 (Bohemian Lager) or White Labs WLP830 (German Lager) yeast (3 qt./~3 L yeast starter)
1.2 cups corn sugar (for priming)

Step by Step
Use water with under 50 ppm carbonates, but over 100 ppm calcium. Step mash with a 5-minute rest at 133 °F (56 °C), a 15-minute rest at 140 °F (60 °C), a 30-minute rest at 154 °F (68 °C) and a 5-minute rest at 168 °F (76 °C). Recirculate wort for about 20 minutes (or until clear), then collect wort until final runnings drop to SG 1.010. Heat sparge water to the point that the grain bed temperature stays around 168 °F (76 °C) during wort collection. Add water, if needed, to make 7 gallons (26 L) of pre-boil wort. Add calcium chloride and boil wort vigorously for 90 minutes.

After boil, cool wort and transfer all but 1 quart (~1 L) to fermenter. Transfer the 1 quart (~1 L) to a sanitized container and store in refrigerator (to be used as kräusen beer). Aerate remainder of the wort well and pitch yeast sediment from yeast starter. Ferment at 50 °F (10 °C) until fermentation slows. Take stored wort (for kräusen beer) from fridge, pitch with a fresh dose of lager yeast. Once kräusen beer starts fermenting, add to main batch of beer and raise temperature to 54 °F (12 °C). When fermentation stops, dump yeast (or rack to secondary) and lager at 40 °F (4.4 °C). Keg and carbonate to 2.5 volumes of CO2.

Boysenberry Crème Blonde Ale
Boysenberry Crème Blonde Ale
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.065 FG = 1.024
IBU = 15 SRM = 5 ABV = 5%

This fruit beer straddles the line between decadent and quaffable. The OG and SRM are for the base beer. The FG and ABV include the impact of the fruit addition.

Ingredients
4.9 lbs. (2.2 kg) Golden Promise pale ale malt
4 lbs. (1.8 kg) 2-row brewer’s malt
0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) light Munich malt (6 °L)
0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) pale wheat malt
2 lbs. (0.9 kg) lactose (30 min.)
4.3 AAU Cascade hops (60 min.) (0.6 oz./17 g at 7.2% alpha acids)
5 lbs. (2.3 kg) frozen boysenberries
1 Madagascar vanilla bean
1⁄2 tsp. yeast nutrient (10 min.)
White Labs WLP002 (English Ale), Wyeast 1968 (London ESB Ale), or LalBrew London ESB Ale yeast
3⁄4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Mill the grains and dough-in, targeting a mash of ~1.5 quarts of water per pound of grain (3.1 L/kg) and a temperature of 150 °F (66 °C). Hold the mash at 150 °F (66 °C) for 60 minutes. Mash out or begin recirculation, then sparge with enough water to yield a total volume of 5 gallons (19 L) of post-boil wort.

Boil for 60 minutes, adding hops, lactose, and yeast nutrient at indicated times remaining. Chill the wort to 66 °F (19 °C) and transfer to a sanitized fermenter. Oxygenate thoroughly.

Pitch yeast and ferment at 66 °F (19 °C) until gravity has stabilized, or nearly so. Thaw and crush the boysenberries. Split and chop the vanilla bean. Rack beer into a secondary fermenter, on top of the boysenberries and vanilla bean. Alternatively, add the boysenberries and chopped vanilla bean to the primary fermenter, avoiding splashing.

Ferment for about a week at 70 °F (21 °C), or until the sugars in the fruit are fermented out.

Package and carbonate the beer to 2.5 volumes of CO2.

Boysenberry Crème Blonde Ale
(5 gallons/19 L, partial mash)
OG = 1.065 FG = 1.024
IBU = 15 SRM = 5 ABV = 5%

Ingredients
4.8 lbs. (2.2 kg) extra light dried malt extract
0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) light Munich malt (6 °L)
0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) pale wheat malt
2 lbs. (0.9 kg) lactose (30 min.)
4.3 AAU Cascade hops (60 min.) (0.6 oz./17 g at 7.2% alpha acids)
5 lbs. (2.3 kg) frozen boysenberries
1 Madagascar vanilla bean
1⁄2 tsp. yeast nutrient (10 min.)
White Labs WLP002 (English Ale), Wyeast 1968 (London ESB Ale), or LalBrew London ESB Ale yeast
3⁄4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Mill the grains and conduct a partial mash with about 2 quarts (1.9 L) of water and a mash temperature of 150 °F (66 °C). Hold the mash at 150 °F (66 °C) for 60 minutes. Wash the grains with 2 qts. (2 L) of hot water, then add enough water to yield a total volume of 5 gallons (19 L) of post-boil wort.

Raise to a boil, remove the kettle from the heat, and stir in the dried malt extract. Return to a boil. Boil for 60 minutes. Follow the remainder of the all-grain recipe.

Tips For Success:
•If boysenberries are not available, raspberries are a good substitute.

•If controlling mash chemistry, target a pH of about 5.4.

•Because of the large amount of lactose, expect the specific gravity to be near 1.027 when it’s time to add the boysenberries and vanilla.

•Spritz the vanilla bean with Star San solution before splitting and chopping.

2010 North American Beer Awards bronze medal winner is an American version of a German classic wheat beer. Bozeman uses Montana-grown malted pale barley, but if you can’t source that, any 2-row should work.

Ingredients
5.4 lbs. (2.45 kg) 2-row pale malt
5.4 lbs. (2.45 kg) wheat malt
0.5 lbs. (0.23 kg) acidulated malt
5.5 AAU Cascade leaf hops (60 min.) (1 oz./28 g at 5.5% alpha acids)
4.25 AAU Northern Brewer leaf hops (5 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 8.5% alpha acids)
1.87 AAU Saaz pellet hops (5 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 3.75% alpha acids)
Wyeast 1056 (American Ale), or White Labs WLP001 (California Ale), or Safale US-05 yeast
3/4 cup (150 g) dextrose (if priming)

Step by Step
Mix the crushed grains with 3.4 gallons (12.8 L) of water at 161 °F (72 °C), stabilizing at 150 °F (65.5 °C) for 60 minutes until conversion is complete. Raise the temperature of the mash to 168 °F (76 °C) with approximately 2.2 gallons (8.3 L) of 200 °F (93 °C) water, and then collect 7 gallons (26.5 L) of wort to begin a 60-minute boil. The specific gravity of the boil should be about 1.038. Add hops as indicated. There should be about 5.5 gallons (21 L) of wort remaining after the boil. Cool the wort to 75 °F (24 °C), areate and pitch yeast. Allow wort to cool to 68 °F (20 °C) for fermenting. When fermentation is complete, wait about 3 more days for a diacetyl rest. Keg or bottle as usual.

Extract with grains option:
Reduce the 2-row pale malt and wheat malt in the all-grain recipe to 0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) each and add 3.3 lbs. (1.5 kg) Briess Bavarian wheat  liquid malt extract, 1.5 lbs. (0.68 kg) Briess Bavarian wheat dried malt extract, and 1 lb. (0.45 kg) Briess Pilsen light dried malt extract. Steep the crushed malted grain in 5.5 gallons (19 L) of 150–160°F (66–71 C°) water for 30 minutes, stirring the grain just prior to removing. Remove grains and bring to a boil, adding malt extracts off heat. Boil 60 minutes. Follow the remaining portion of the all-grain recipe.

Bragging Braggot
Bragging Braggot
(5 gallons/19L, extract with grains)
OG = 1.080 FG = 1.014
SRM = 8–10 ABV = 8%

Ingredients
7.75 lbs. (3.5 kg) light liquid malt extract
8.8 lbs. (4 kg) honey
1 lb. (0.45 kg) crystal malt (50–65 °L)
1.5 oz. (42 g) Northern Brewer hops (optional)
White Labs WLP715 (Champagne) (for primary fermentaion)
Wyeast 1007 (German Ale), Wyeast 3632 (Dry Mead), Wyeast 1098 (Whitbread British Ale), Wyeast 1728 (Scottish Ale), or White Labs WLP028 (Edinburgh Scottish Ale) yeast (for secondary fermentation)

Step by Step
The burner under the brew kettle was turned on before the club members arrived, so the brewing liquor (water) was hot when we got there. If you wish to copy our simple braggot method, proceed as follows to generate your wort:

Place the milled crystal malt into a steeping bag, immerse it in the hot brewing liquor (for color only). The temperature should be around 190 °F (88 °C). Let the grain rest for about 30 mins. Remove the crystal malt from the water and discard. Stir the extract into the water. Bring the wort to a boil. Once the proteins start to coagulate (flake), add the hops. Add the honey about 30 minutes into the boil. By that time, most of the hops have isomerized. During the boil, skim off any scum that may appear on the surface of the wort. After a total boil of about one hour, heat exchange the wort to the temperature required by the type of yeast that you have chosen.

Fermentation Schedule:
Different members pitched greatly different liquid ale yeasts either as single strains or in combination. The choices included Wyeast 1007 (German Ale), Wyeast 3632 (Dry Mead), Wyeast 1098 (Whitbread British Ale), White Labs WLP715 (Champagne), Wyeast 1728 (Scottish Ale), or White Labs WLP028 (Edinburgh Scottish Ale) yeast.

Aerate the cooled wort and pitch the yeast or yeasts of your choice. (We started two of the carboys with champagne yeast.)

Ferment the wort at the temperature required for your choice of yeast. (We fermented the two carboys with champagne yeast at around 68°F (20 ºC). It may be necessary to use a blow-off tube, because this braggot ferments extra vigorously and produces plenty of carbon dioxide (CO2).

Measure the gravity once a day to monitor progress. (At a gravity reading of 1.030, we added a German ale yeast to one of the carboys. We added a dry English yeast to the second carboy at a gravity reading of 1.020.)

After about a week of primary fermentation, transfer the brew off its lees and keep it in a secondary fermenter at about 50–55 °F (10–13 ºC) for another four weeks. (The carboy with the German ale yeast finished at a FG of 1.018 and remained fairly sweet, while the carboy with the English ale yeast continued fermenting, bringing the FG down to a dry 1.010.)

These were the results from two identical worts kept under identical conditions, except for the yeast strains. The difference therefore must be due to the fact that these strains have different natural attenuation characteristics or nutrient requirement differences.

Rack the brew again and age it for about two months in a Cornelius keg or in bottles. There is no need to prime the brew because the residual sugars from the honey will continue to break down and create effervescence. If you condition the brew in a Cornelius keg, select a temperature of about 45°F (7°C) and set the pressure to about 13 psi. If you have the ability to measure the amount of dissolved CO2 in your beer, the proper value should be about 2.25 volumes.

Serving tip: When you pour the braggot into a glass, allow for plenty of headspace, because this brew can be a very sparkling surprise!

Braggot
(5 gallons/19 L, extract with grains)
OG = 1.086 FG = 1.020
IBU = 20 SRM = 7 ABV = 9.2%

Ingredients
0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) Briess Copper Carapils malt (30 °L)
0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) crystal malt (20 °L)
6 lbs. (2.7 kg) golden liquid malt extract
6 lbs. (2.7 kg) wildflower honey (0 min.)
1 oz. Willamette hops (60 min.) (1 oz./28 g at 4% alpha acids)
1 oz. (28 g) Kent Goldings hops (0 min.)
1/4 tsp. yeast nutrient (10 min.)
1 tsp. Irish moss (10 min.)
1 sachet dried ale yeast (Safale US-05 or Lallemand BRY-97 or Mangrove Jack's M44)
1 sachet dried champagne yeast
1 cup extra light dried malt extract (if priming)

Step by Step
Heat 3 gal. (11 L) water to 150 °F (66 °C), place cracked grains in a mesh grain bag, place in water, and cover. Steep at 150 °F (66 °C) for 30 min., then remove grains. Add malt extract and bring to a boil. Total boil is 60 min. Add Willamette hops and boil 50 min. Add Irish moss and yeast nutrients boil 10 min. more. Remove from heat and add the Goldings hops and honey, steep 30 min., and strain out the hops if you can. Cool the wort and add to fermenter along with enough water to make 5.25 gal (20 L). When wort cools to 70 °F (21 °C), pitch both yeast strains.

Ferment warm (68 to 72 °F/20 to 22 °C) for four weeks, then rack to secondary. Age in a cool (50 to 55 °F/10 to 13 °C) and dark corner for six to eight weeks until clarified. Prime with dry malt, bottle, and store for proper carbonation. Or keg and force carbonate. Aging or up to a year will not hurt this braggot, trust me.

Notes:
Yeast:
I use dry yeasts on this brew because I don’t want to emphasize any particular yeast character. The ale yeast gets it going and allows the malty sweetness to establish itself, and the wine yeast completes the fermentation of this high-alcohol brew after the ale yeast gives up.

Gravity:
Play with the recipe to make it weaker or stronger. Honey is about the same as malt extract in terms of sugar density; figure a pound of either adds about seven points to your gravity. If you make a bigger version, be prepared to be that much more patient, especially if you increase the amount of honey. You should also increase the yeast nutrient slightly if you use more honey.

Hops:
Be careful not to overhop this brew. The emphasis here should be on rich, malty, and sweet flavor; the hops are merely to balance and contrast a little.

1 tsp. Irish moss
Wyeast 2124 (Bohemian Lager) or White Labs WLP838 (Southern German Lager) yeast
3/4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by step
Bring one gallon of water to 155 °F (68 °C), add the crushed grain and hold for 30 minutes at 150°F. Strain the grain into the brewpot and sparge with one gallon of 168°F water. Add the dry malt, malt syrup, maltodextrin and bittering hops. Bring the total volume in the brewpot to 2.5 gallons.

Boil the wort for 45 minutes, then add the Irish moss. Boil with Irish moss for 15 minutes, then remove the brewpot from the stove. Cool the wort for 15 minutes in an ice bath or chill with wort chiller. Strain into the primary fermenter and add water to obtain 5-1/8 gallons. Add yeast when wort has cooled to below 80°F. Oxygenate-aerate well.

Start the primary fermentation at 60° to 62°F until fermentation begins (approximately 24 hours). Bring primary fermenter to 47° to 52°F for 7 days, then rack into secondary (glass carboy).

Ferment at 47° to 52°F until the target gravity has been reached and the beer has cleared (approximately 4 weeks). Then prime and bottle the beer. Carbonate at 70° to 72°F for two to three weeks. Store at cellar temperature.

Mini-Mash: Acidify the mash water to below 7.2 pH. Mash 1 lb. (0.45 kg) German two-row Pilsner malt and the specialty grains in 1 gallon (3.8 L) water at 152°F for 90 minutes. Sparge with 1.5 gallon water at 5.7 pH and 168°F. Then follow the extract recipe, omitting 2 lbs. Muntons extra-light dry malt extract from the boil.

All-Grain: Acidify the mash water to below 7.2 pH. Mash 7.25 lbs. German two-row Pilsner malt, 2.75 lbs. German Munich malt, 13 oz. Belgian Cara-Munich malt, 6 oz. German dark crystal malt (65° Lovibond) and 1.5 oz. British chocolate malt in 3 gallons of water at 153°F for 90 minutes. Sparge with 5.5 gallons of water at 5.7 pH and 168°F. The total boil time is approximately 120 minutes.

Add 4.8 AAU of bittering hops for the last 60 minutes of the boil. Add the Irish moss as indicated by the extract recipe.

This tasty Munich dunkel is ready to drink as soon as it is carbonated. The beer will peak between two and five months after it is carbonated and will last for up to eight months at cool cellar temperatures.

This Reno, Nevada brewery's witbier is a cloudy pale yellow and features spicy, fruity, citrus aromas.

Ingredients
5.5 lbs. (2.5 kg) Pilsner malt
5.5 lbs. (2.5 kg) wheat malt
0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) flaked oats
3 AAU Hallertauer hops (45 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 6% alpha acids)
3 AAU Hallertauer hops (15 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 6% alpha acids)
1.9 AAU Saaz hops (1 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 3.8% alpha acids)
1.5 oz. (43 g) sweet orange peel (10 min.)
0.5 oz. (14 g) coriander, cracked (10 min.)
0.5 oz. (14 g) grains of paradise, cracked (10 min.)
0.2 oz. (6 g) pink peppercorns, cracked (10 min.)
0.2 oz. (6 g) chamomile (10 min.)
0.2 oz. (6 g) heather tips (10 min.)
1/4 tsp. vanilla extract (optional)
White Labs WLP400 (Belgian Wit Ale) or Wyeast 3068 (Weihenstephan Weizen) yeast
¾ cup (150 g) dextrose (if priming)

Step by Step
Mill the grains and mix with 3.3 gallons (12.5 L) of 165 °F (74 °C) strike water to reach a mash temperature of 153 °F (67 °C). Hold this temperature for 60 minutes. Vorlauf until your runnings are clear. Sparge the grains with 3.1 gallons (11.7 L) and top up as necessary to obtain 6 gallons (23 L) of wort. Boil for 90 minutes, adding hops according to the ingredient list and Irish moss if desired. With 10 minutes remaining, add the spices loosely in a large spice/hop bag, ensuring that there is sufficient room for water flow. After the boil, turn off heat and whirlpool for 10 minutes, and (optionally) add vanilla extract. Then chill the wort to slightly below fermentation temperature, about 70 °F (21 °C). Aerate the wort with pure oxygen or filtered air and pitch yeast. Ferment at 72 °F (22 °C) for 24 hours after the first visible signs of active fermentation. Then decrease temperature and hold at 64 °F (18 °C) for up to 20 days. Once the beer completes fermentation, bottle or keg the beer and carbonate to approximately 2.5 volumes. You can cold-crash the beer prior to packaging to 35 °F (2 °C) for 48 hours to improve clarity.

Extract with grains option:

Substitute the Pilsner and wheat malts in the all-grain recipe with 3.75 lbs. (1.7 kg) Pilsen liquid malt extract and 3.75 lbs. (1.7 kg) wheat liquid malt extract. Bring 5.6 gallons (21.2 L) of water to approximately 162 °F (72 °C) and hold there while steeping the flaked oats in a grain bag for 15 minutes. Remove the grain bag and let drain. Add the malt extract while stirring, and stir until completely dissolved. Bring the wort to a boil. Follow the remaining portion of the all-grain recipe.

Tips for Success
Head Brewer Josh Watterson uses rice hulls in the mash to promote the easy flow of wort from the mash tun, so if you have consistent issues with stuck mashes/sparges due to the use of wheat malt, you should follow whatever procedure you would ordinarily use for beers with a high wheat content. He also notes that spicing is essential to witbier, and you should feel free to adjust the spice levels/amounts recommended here to your specific taste. Finally, if the beer seems too "heavy," consider adding a protein rest to your mash schedule to thin out the beer’s body without compromising flavor or gravity.

This massively malty Bavarian dopplebock is darker than Salvator and shows a distinct chocolate malt character.

Ingredients
10.2 lbs. (4.6 kg) Pilsner malt
2.33 lbs. (1.05 kg) Munich malt (10 °L)
2.33 lbs. (1.05 kg) Munich malt (20 °L)
0.5 lbs. (0.23 kg) Wyermann Carafa® Special II malt
6 AAU Hallertau hops (60 min.) (1.5 oz./42 g of 4% alpha acids)
1 tsp Irish moss (15 mins.)
White Labs WLP833 (German Bock Lager) or Wyeast 2487 (Hella Bock Lager) yeast (4 qt./4 L yeast starter)
3/4 cups (150 g) corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Perform a double decoction mash with a 15-minute rest at 131 °F (55 °C) and a second rest at 158 °F (70 °C) for 45 minutes. Boil the wort for 90 minutes, adding the hops and Irish moss at times indicated in the ingredients list. After the boil, chill the wort rapidly to 55–58 °F (13–14 °C), aerate well, and pitch the yeast. Ferment at 55 °F (13 °C). When fermentation is complete, allow temperature to rise to 60 °F (16 °C) for two days for a diacytel rest, then rack to a secondary fermenter and cool to 40 °F (4.4 °C). Lager for at least six weeks, then bottle or keg as normal.

Partial Mash Option: Omit the Pilsner malt and scale the Munich (10 °L) and the Munich (20 °L) malt additions down to 1.33 lbs. (0.60 kg) each and the Carafa® Special II down to 5 oz. (143 g). Add 2.75 lbs. (1.25 kg) Pilsen dried malt extract, 5 lbs. (2.3 kg) Weyermann Bavarian Dunkel liquid malt extract (late addition). In a large pot, heat 4.4 quarts (4.2 L) of water to 169 °F (76 °C). Add crushed grains to grain bag. Submerge bag and let grains steep around 158 °F (70 °C) for 45 minutes. While grains steep, begin heating 2.1 gallons (7.8 L) of water in your brewpot. When steep is complete, remove 1.5 qts. (1.4 L) of water from the brew pot and add to the "grain tea" in steeping pot. Place a colander over brew pot and place steeping bag in it. Pour the grain tea (with water added) through grain bag. Bring the brewpot to a boil, then stir in the dried malt extract, add hops and begin the 60 minute boil. Try to keep the brew pot topped off to 3.5 gallons (13.2 L). With 15 minutes left in boil, turn off heat and stir in the liquid malt extract and Irish moss. Stir well to dissolve extract, then resume heating. (Keep the boil clock running while you stir.) At the end of the boil, cool the wort and transfer to fermenter. Add enough cool water to make 5 gallons (19 L). Aerate the wort and pitch yeast. Follow the remainder of the all-grain recipe.

OG = 1.080 FG = 1.018
IBU = 30 SRM = 25 ABV = 8.3%

Ingredients
7.7 lbs. (3.5 kg) light dried malt extract
5.6 oz. (160 g) caramel malt (40 °L)
4 oz. (113 g) aromatic malt
8 oz. (227 g) Simpson’s DRC malt
1 lb. (0.45 kg) D-180 candi syrup
10 AAU Sterling hops (45 min.) (1.3 oz./37 g at 7.5% alpha acids)
Wyeast 1214 (Belgian Abbey Yeast), White Labs WLP500 (Monastery Ale), or LalBrew Abbaye yeast
¾ cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Make a 1.8-quart (1.7-L) yeast starter prior to brew day if you’re using liquid yeast.

Add hops to a muslin bag and boil hops in 2–3 quarts of water for 45 minutes. At the same time, heat 1 gallon (4 L) of water to 160 °F (71 °C), then steep the grains for 30 minutes at this temperature.

Put a large strainer over the brewpot. Pour the closed hop bag and hop water into the strainer. Press the bag with a paddle or spoon to get all the liquid from it. Remove the hop bag. Put the grain bag into the strainer. Rinse the grains with 1 gallon (4 L) of hot water. Add water to the level in your brewpot that will yield 5 gallons (19 L) after adding the dried malt extract and D-180 candi syrup. Heat to 195–200 °F (90–93 °C). Turn off the heat and stir in the malt extract and candi syrup. Wait 15 minutes to pasteurize the wort. Chill the wort to the lower end of the ideal temperature range for the yeast you choose.

Aerate or oxygenate the wort, if using a liquid yeast strain, and add the yeast. When fermentation is complete, keg or bottle as usual.

Bavarian-style lager yeast (your choice) (4 qt./4 L yeast starter)
3/4 cup (150 g) dextrose (if priming)

Step by Step
Two or three days before you brew, make a 1-gallon (~4 L) yeast starter. On brew day, to approximate the mash conditions (and lautering process) used by the brewery, mash in so that you use around 20 qts. (19 L) of brewing liquor — this is a mash thickness of about 1.8 qts./lb. (3.7 L/kg), thinner than a typical homebrew mash. Mash in to 113 °F (45 °C), and give the mash an initial hydration rest of about 30 minutes. Slowly heat the mash to raise the temperature to 149 °F (65 °C). A rate of just over 1 °F (~0.5 °C) every minute will mean the temperature ramp will take about a half hour. Rest at 149 °F (65 °C) of 20 minutes. Then repeat the temperature increase, this time to 154 °F (68 °C) for a 5-minute rest. The next rest is at 162 °F (72 °C) for about 10 minutes. To raise the temperature for the mash out, you have two options. Heat the mash as before or boil a decoction, as is done at Faust. For the decoction, draw about one-quarter of the mash (a little over a gallon/4 L) into a large pot and bring it to a boil. Boil for 10 minutes, then return the decoction to the main mash for a temperature increase to 169 °F (76 °C). Recirculate for about 15 minutes before you collect your wort. Collect all the wort from the grain bed, without sparging. When all the wort is in the kettle, measure the volume. Subtract this from your target pre-boil volume. (The boil is 70 minutes, so 6.2 gallons/23 L of pre-boil wort would work if you typically boil off a gallon an hour.) This is the volume of sparge water you will use. Divide this into three aliquots and sparge with each, taking about 30 minutes to rinse the grain bed and collect the wort each time. (If you collected 4 gallons/15 L of wort, you would need 2.2 gallons/8.3 L of sparge water separated into three 2.9 qt./2.7 L aliquots, to reach 6.2 gallons/23 L of pre-boil wort.) Your sparge water should be 169 °F (76 °C) or hotter if your grain bed temperature has dropped below 169 °F (76 °C). The boiling time is 70 minutes. Add hops as indicated and the SINAMAR® about 10 minutes before shut-down. Whirlpool the wort for up to 20 minutes, then chill to the temperature range of your selected yeast, usually to about 50–59 °F (10–15 °C) for most Bavarian lager strains.

Ferment the brew like a typical German lager. After primary fermentation (and a diacetyl rest, if needed), rack the beer off the yeast and lager it for 4–6 weeks. The optimal lagering temperature would be 28 °F (-2 °C), but refrigerator temperature (around 40 °F/4.4 °C) will work.

Partial mash option:
Reduce the Munich I malt to 1 lb. 4 oz. (0.57 kg) and Rauchmalz to 9.1 oz. (0.26 kg). Replace the Pilsner malt with 6 lbs. 10 oz. (3 kg) Munich liquid malt extract. Steep the grains at 149 °F (65 °C) for 45 minutes in 3 qts. (2.8 L) of water. Add water to make at least 3 gallons (11 L), add half the extract and boil for 70 minutes. Follow the remaining portion of the all-grain recipe.

Breakfast of Champions (Oatmeal Stout)
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.052 FG = 1.013
IBU = 33 SRM = 25 ABV = 5.0%

Ingredients
8.5 lbs. (3.9 kg) 2-row pale ale malt
12 oz. (0.34 kg) flaked oats
10 oz. (0.28 kg) crystal malt (40 °L)
6.0 oz. (0.17 kg) crystal malt (60 °L)
5.0 oz. (0.14 kg) chocolate malt
4.0 oz. (0.11 kg) roasted malt (500 °L)
1 tsp. Irish moss
9 AAU Kent Goldings hops (1.8 oz./51 g of 5% alpha acids)
Wyeast 1084 (Irish Ale) or White Labs WLP004 (Irish Ale) yeast (1.5 qt./~1.5 L yeast starter)
3.5 oz. (100 g) corn sugar (for priming)

Step by Step
Although unusual for an English-style ale, a step mash will work well for this beer. In your kettle, heat 12 quarts (11 L) of water to 133 °F (56 °C). Mix hot water and grains in your kettle and mash in to 122 °F (50 °C). (This is a thick mash at this point.) Let mash stand for 30 minutes. In a large kitchen pot, heat 5 quarts (~5 L) of water to a boil and stir this into mash after initial rest. (Now the mash with be at a "normal" thickness for an infusion mash.) Then, add direct heat to the kettle to bring mash to 154 °F (68 °C).

Let mash rest for 45 minutes. Heat mash to 170 °F (77 °C), transfer mash to lauter tun and let rest for 5 minutes (to settle). Recirculate wort until clear, then begin running off wort. Heat sparge water to point that grain bed temperature remains around 168 °F (76 °C) during sparge. Collect 6 gallons (23 L) of wort. Bring wort to a boil. Once hot break forms, add hops and boil for 60 minutes.

Add Irish moss with 15 minutes left in boil. Cool wort and transfer to fermenter. (You should have 5 gallons/19 L at this point.) Aerate wort and pitch yeast. Ferment at 70 °F (21 °C).

Countertop partial mash option:
Replace amount of 2-row pale ale malt in all-grain recipe with 1 lb. 11 oz. (0.77 kg) 2-row pale ale malt, 14 oz. (0.40 kg) light dried malt extract and 4.0 lbs. (1.8 kg) light liquid malt extract. Heat 5.5 qts. (5.2 L) of water to 167 °F (75 °C) and pour it into a 2-gallon (7.6-L) beverage cooler. Add crushed grains and flaked oats to a large
steeping bag and slowly submerge in cooler. Open bag and stir grains with a spoon.

Break up any "lumps." Note level of water in cooler after grains are added. Let partial mash rest, starting at 154 °F (68 °C), for 45 minutes. While mash is resting, bring 0.75 gallons (2.8 L) of water to a boil in your brewpot. Also, bring 5.5 qts. (5.2 L) of water to 180 °F (82 °C) in another pot. Open spigot on cooler and collect first wort. Add it to boiling water in brewpot. Begin heating this wort to a boil. Add 180 °F (82 °C) water to cooler until liquid level is the same as before.

Stir grains and let sit for 5 minutes, then collect second wort and add it — along with the dried malt extract — to your brewpot. Bring wort to a boil, add hops and boil for 60 minutes. Stir in liquid malt extract and Irish moss for final 15 minutes of the boil. Cool wort and transfer to fermenter. Add water to fermenter to make 5 gallons (19 L). Aerate, pitch yeast and let ferment at 70 °F (21 °C).

"The crystal and roasted malts merge well together to yield soft caramel and raisin notes. These flavors will evolve gracefully as the beer ages." — Randy Thiel, Brewer.

Ingredients
5.6 lbs. (2.54 kg) Pilsner malt
2.25 lbs. (1.02 kg) Munich malt (10 °L)
2.25 lbs. (1.02 kg) amber malt (30 °L)
1 lb. (0.45 kg) Weyermann Caraaroma® malt (150 °L)
2.66 lbs. (1.21 kg) corn sugar (90 min.)
6.25 AAU Styrian Golding hops (60 min.) (1.25 oz./35 g at 5% alpha acids)
0.33 oz. Styrian Golding hops (0 min.)
0.5 oz. (14 g) sweet orange peel (1 min.)
0.5 oz. (14 g) licorice root (1 min.)
0.25 oz. (7 g) crushed, toasted coriander seed (1 min.)
0.25 oz. (7 g) crushed, toasted cumin seed (1 min.)
0.1 oz. (3 g) star anise (1 min.)
Wyeast 1214 (Belgian Ale) or White Labs WLP500 (Monastery Ale) or cultured Ommegang yeast
1.2 cups (240 g) dextrose (if priming)

Step by Step
Step mash with a 10-minute rest at 113 °F (45 °C), a 10-minute rest at 144 °F (62 °C), a 15-minute rest at 154 °F (68 °C), a 15-minute rest at 162 °F (72 °C) and a 5-minute rest at 169 °F (76 °C). Mash out, vorlauf, and then sparge at 170 °F (77 °C) to collect about 7 gallons (27 L) of wort. Boil for 90 minutes, adding sugar, hops and spices as indicated. After the boil, give the wort a stir to create a whirlpool and let settle for 15 minutes. Cool, aerate, and pitch yeast. Start fermentation cool at 68–70 °F (20–21 °C), then allow temperature to rise during fermentation, or you can ramp up the fermentation temperature until all signs of fermentation are complete. Condition for 2 weeks at 32 °F (0 °C). Keg and adjust to 3.5 volumes CO2, or bottle in heavy bottles with dextrose with a target of 3.5 volumes of CO2.

Partial mash option: Reduce the Pilsner malt in the all-grain recipe to 1 lb. 2 oz. (0.51 kg) and add 3.33 lbs. (1.5 kg) Weyermann Bavarian Pilsner liquid malt extract. Heat 10.5 qts. (9.9 L) of steeping water in your brewpot to 124 °F (51 °C). In a separate pot, heat 7.9 qts. (7.4 L) of rinse water to 170 °F (77 °C). Place crushed grains in a large steeping bag and submerge bag in your brewpot. Heat steeping water quickly to 144 °F (62 °C), stirring occasionally, then turn down heat and slowly raise temperature to 169 °F (76 °C). It should take about 30 minutes to go from 144 °F (62 °C) to 169 °F (76 °C). Remove the grain bag and place in a colander over your brewpot. Rinse grains slowly and evenly with hot rinse water. Heat this "grain tea" — approximately 17.4 qts. (16.4 L) — to a boil. Boil 60 minutes, adding corn sugar at the beginning of the boil and hops at time indicated. Follow the remaining portion of the all-grain recipe and top off to 5 gallons (19 L) after cooling.

2.5 lb. (1.1 kg) Belgian 2-row pale malt
2 lb. (0.91 kg) light candi sugar
6.5 AAU Styrian Golding hops (60 mins.) (1.3 oz./36 g of 5% alpha acid)
1.75 AAU Saaz hops (2 mins.) (0.5 oz./14 g of 3.5% alpha acid)
1 tsp. Irish moss (15 mins.)
0.33 oz. (9 g) dried ginger root (5 min.)
1.5 oz. (43 g) fresh sweet orange peel (5 min.)
0.33 oz. (9 g) crushed coriander seed (2 min.)
0.1 oz (3 g) grains of paradise (2 min.)
White Labs WLP550 (Belgian Ale) or Wyeast 1214 (Belgian Abbey) yeast (1 qt./~1 L yeast starter)
3/4 cup (150 g) dextrose (for priming)

STEP BY STEP
Brewery Ommegang uses a multiple-step mash starting at 122°F (50°C) and ending at 152°F (67°C). Once your wort is collected, add Styrian Golding (bittering) hops and boil for 60 minutes, adding the other ingredients as specified. Pitch the yeast and ferment at 68°F (20°C). (Option: Pitch the yeast to the wort at 64°F (18°C) and let the temperature rise during fermentation, as high as 77°F (25°C). Bottle or keg your beer, age for 2 to 3 weeks, and enjoy!

EXTRACT WITH GRAINS OPTION:
Replace the Belgian Pilsner and 2-row pale malts with 0.25 pounds (0.11 kg) Muntons light dried malt extract and 6.6 pounds (2.97 kg) Muntons light liquid malt extract (late addition). Steep the crushed grains in 3 quarts (2.8 L) of water at 150°F (66°C) for 45 minutes. Rinse the grains with 1.5 quarts (about 1.5 L) of water at 170°F (77°C). Add water to make 3 gallons (11 L). Add the dried malt extract and sugar and bring the wort to a boil. Add the Styrian Golding (bittering) hops and boil for 60 minutes, adding the other ingredients as specified.

This is a traditional, Belgian-style wheat ale. Soft, hazy, and offering the characteristic Belgian phenols from the yeast along with the gentle taste of coriander and orange.

Ingredients
5.8 lbs. (2.6 kg) Pilsner malt
2.4 lbs. (1.1 kg) white wheat malt
1.1 lbs. (0.48 kg) unmalted wheat berries
0.39 lbs. (0.18 kg) flaked oats
2.5 AAU Styrian Golding hops (90 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 5% alpha acids)
0.35 oz. (10 g) crushed coriander seed (10 min.)
1.2 oz. (34 g) sweet orange peel (10 min.)
Wyeast 3944 (Belgian Witbier) or White Labs WLP400 (Belgian Wit Ale) yeast
1 cup (200 g) dextrose (if bottling)

Step by Step
Mash the grains for 5 minutes at 113 °F (45 °C); 35 minutes at 144 °F (62 °C); 20 minutes at 154 °F (68 °C). Mash-off at 165 °F (74 °C), collecting about 7 gallons (27 L) of wort. Boil 90 minutes, adding hops at beginning of boil and spices for final 10 minutes. Cool, aerate, and pitch yeast at 70 °F (21 °C); let temperature rise but not above 79 °F (26 °C). Carbonate to 2.7 volumes of CO2.

Partial mash option: Reduce the Pilsen malt in the all-grain recipe to 2.1 oz. (59 g) and add 4 lbs. (1.8 kg) Weyermann Pilsner malt extract. In a 2-gallon (7.6-L) beverage cooler, mash crushed grains in 5.5 qts. (5.2 L) of water for 45 minutes at 150 °F (66 °C). While mash is resting, heat 1 gallon (3.8 L) of water to a boil in your brewpot and another 5.5 qts. (5.2 L) of sparge water to around 180 °F (82 °C). Recirculate wort then run off to brewpot. Stir sparge water into grains. Recirculate and run off again. Boil 60 minutes, adding hops and spices at times indicated and liquid malt extract with 15 minutes left in boil. Top off to 5 gallons (19 L) after cooling and follow the remaining portion of the all-grain recipe.

(5 gallons/19 L, extract with grains)
OG = 1.069 FG = 1.016
IBU = 55 SRM = 10 ABV = 6.9%

Ingredients
7.2 lbs. (3.3 kg) light dried malt extract
1 lb. (0.45 kg) caramel malt (40 °L)
12.9 AAU Simcoe® hops (45 min.) (1 oz./28 g at 12.9% alpha acids)
26.4 AAU Citra® hops (hopstand) (2 oz./56 g at 13.2% alpha acids)
4 oz. (113 g) Citra® hops (dry hop)
1 tsp. gypsum
2 tsp. calcium chloride
SafAle US-05, LalBrew Voss Kveik Ale, or any clean fermenting yeast
¾ cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Boil Simcoe® hops in a muslin bag in 2–3 quarts of water for 45 minutes. At the same time heat 1 gallon (4 L) of water to 160 °F (71 °C), then steep the caramel malt for 30 minutes.

Put a large strainer over the brewpot. Pour the closed hop bag and hop water into the strainer. Press the bag with a paddle or spoon to get all the liquid from it. Remove the hop bag. Put the grain bag into the strainer. Rinse the grains with 1 gallon (4 L) of hot water. Add water to the level in your brewpot that will yield 5 gallons (19 L) after adding the malt extract. Heat to 195–200 °F (90–93 °C) and add your salts. Turn off the heat and stir in the extract. Wait 15 minutes to pasteurize the wort, or longer if necessary to get the temperature down to 170–176 °F (77–80 °C). Add the bagged hopstand hops and hold for 90 minutes.

Remove the hops and chill the wort to the lower end of the ideal temperature range for your yeast. While the wort is chilling, put a strainer on top of the brewpot and put the hopstand hops bag into the strainer. Press the bag with a sanitized paddle or spoon to get all the liquid. Aerate or oxygenate the wort if using a liquid yeast, and then pitch the yeast.

When the fermentation is 80% to 90% complete, add the dry hops. After two or three days remove the dry hops. Put a strainer over the top of your carboy if it is a wide mouth. Otherwise, put the strainer over a sanitized saucepan. Press the hop bag with a sanitized paddle or spoon to get all the liquid out of it.

When fermentation is complete, keg or bottle as usual.

(5 gallon/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.124 FG = 1.049
IBU= 53 SRM = 15 ABV = 10%

The Brew Kettle Production Works (Strongsville, Ohio) utilizes three specialty grains along with a load of base malt to brew this malt-forward English-style barleywine.

Ingredients
25 lbs. (11.3 kg) 2-row American pale malt
0.75 lb. (0.34 kg) honey malt
0.75 lb. (0.34 kg) crystal malt (60 °L)
0.25 lb. (0.11 kg) Special B malt
1⁄2 tsp. yeast nutrients (10 min.)
9.3 AAU Horizon hops (75 min.) (1.13 oz./32 g at 8.2% alpha acids)
4.3 AAU Cascade hops (30 min.) (0.75 oz./21g at 5.75% alpha acids)
5.25 AAU Centennial hops (30 min.) (0.5 oz./14g at 10.5% alpha acids)
White Labs WLP090 (San Diego Super) or Mangrove Jack’s M42 (New World Strong Ale) yeast
2⁄3 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step

One key to this beer is having enough healthy yeast for a strong fermentation. Jack Hammer uses White Labs WLP090, but you can use any yeast strain of your choice that can ferment high gravity wort. Use double or more yeast as you would in a typical ale batch. Your best bet for achieving this is to start with two vials/smack packs and prepare a starter to double this amount.

On brew day, if you can control your mash temperature, mash in at 1.15 qts./lb. (2.4 L/kg) strike water, about 30.7 qts. (29.1 L) to achieve a rest at 146 °F (63 °C) for beta amylase conversion. Hold for 30 minutes then raise your temperature to 162 °F (72 °C) to complete alpha amylase conversion. If employing a single-infusion mash, mash in at 152 °F (67 °C). Once converted, recirculate and collect your wort, heating the wort immediately after collection begins. Sparge with 18 qts. (17 L) to collect 8.5 gallons (32.2 L) wort. The SG should be 1.077, supplement with sugar if your room temperature reading is low. Boil for 180 minutes to produce an intense kettle caramelization and to reach your original gravity and volume target, about 5.25 gallons (20 L) of 1.124 SG wort at the end of the boil.

Chill to 66–68 °F (19–20 °C) and pitch your active yeast starter. Aerate/oxygenate heavily and keep an eye on fermentation, ensuring it doesn’t rise too high, creating fusels and unwanted esters. After the first couple days, raise temperature to 70 °F (21 °C). After fermentation is complete, chill and age for several weeks to several months, giving the flavors time to mature.

(5 gallon/19 L, extract with grains)
OG = 1.124 FG = 1.049
IBU= 53 SRM = 15 ABV = 10%

Ingredients
13.25 lbs. (6.1 kg) extra light dried malt extract
0.75 lb. (0.34 kg) honey malt
0.75 lb. (0.34 kg) crystal malt (60 °L)
0.25 lb. (0.11 kg) Special B malt
1⁄2 tsp. yeast nutrients (10 min.)
9.3 AAU Horizon hops (75 min.) (1.13 oz./32 g at 8.2% alpha acids)
4.3 AAU Cascade hops (30 min.) (0.75 oz./21g at 5.75% alpha acids)
5.25 AAU Centennial hops (30 min.) (0.5 oz./14g at 10.5% alpha acids)
White Labs WLP090 (San Diego Super) or Mangrove Jack’s M42 (New World Strong Ale) yeast
2⁄3 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step

Since we have less than a pound of grain that would typically be mashed, we can employ an extract with grains method here. But if you prefer to stay on the safe side, cut back the dried malt extract by 0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) and add 1 pound (0.45 kg) of pale malt for a partial mash.

Put your specialty grains in a muslin bag, bring one gallon (4 L) of water up to a temperature of about 152 °F (76 °C) and steep for about 30 minutes. Going a full 30 minutes at that temperature is likely to convert some of the starch in honey malt since honey malt is not completely devoid of diastatic enzymes. Rinse the grains with 1 gallon (4 L) hot water then, fill your brewpot to 6 gallons (23 L) total and raise to a boil. At boil, take pot off the heat and add the dried malt extract, stirring constantly so it doesn’t stick to the bottom of the pot. Boil for 75 minutes adding the hops at times indicated.

Chill to 66–68 °F (19–20 °C) and pitch your active yeast starter. Aerate/oxygenate heavily and keep an eye on fermentation temperature, ensuring it doesn’t rise too high, creating fusels and unwanted esters. After the first couple days, raise temperature to 70 °F (21 °C). After fermentation is complete, chill and age for several weeks to several months, giving the flavors time to mature.

(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.054 FG = 1.013
IBU = 37 SRM = 49 ABV = 5.3%

This recipe is Brewport Brewing Co.’s interpretation of a porter recipe from 1904 found in Hartmann Brewery’s recipe archives (the now defunct Hartmann Brewery was in the same city of Bridgeport, Connecticut as Brewport).

Ingredients
6.75 lbs. (3.1 kg) pale malt
2.75 lbs. (1.25 kg) flaked maize
1.5 lbs. (0.68 kg) Briess black malt (500 °L)
0.9 lb. (0.41 kg) Briess caramel malt (40 °L)
10 AAU Centennial hops (60 min.) (1 oz./28 g at 10% alpha acids)
5 g table salt
Wyeast 1099 (Whitbread Ale) or SafAle S-04 yeast
2⁄3 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by step
Mash the grains and flaked maize at 148–150 °F (64–66 °C) with 3.5 gallons (13 L) of water. After 60 minutes, run off and sparge with water at 160–170 °F (71–77 °C) to collect 6 gallons (23 L) of wort. Boil for 60 minutes, adding the Centennial hops and salt at the start. Cool to about 70 °F (21 °C) and pitch the yeast.

Ferment seven days at about 65 °F (18 °C), then rack to secondary for a further 5–7 days before racking to keg or bottling and carbonating to 2.0–2.5 psi. I recommend keeping this beer 3–4 weeks before drinking. It will be very bitter due to the large percent of black malt immediately, but a little age mellows that bitterness, resulting in an enjoyable historical porter.

Tips for success:
There is no water treatment in this recipe. That is because we used essentially the same Bridgeport water as in the original recipe from 1904 in which Hartmann made no adjustments. You should check the pH of your mash, which should be 5.4–5.5.

This will be somewhat darker than the original because of the lower
brewhouse efficiency (65%) and I have kept the malt ratios the same as in the original so there is a greater color contribution from the black malt. Feel free to adjust the malt bill weights to fit your brewhouse efficiency, keeping the grain ratios the same.

I have also not included a late hopping stage for simplicity since I do not think it added anything to the original. We did add Wye Challenger hops at flameout in the Brewport version, however.

(5 gallons/19 L, extract with grains)
OG = 1.054 FG = 1.015
IBU = 37 SRM = 49 ABV = 5.1%

Ingredients
6 lbs. (2.7 kg) pale liquid malt extract
0.4 lb. (0.2 kg) pale dried malt extract
1.5 lbs. (0.68 kg) Briess black malt (500 °L)
0.9 lb. (0.41 kg) Briess caramel malt (40 °L)
10 AAU Centennial hops (60 min.) (1 oz./28 g at 10% alpha acids)
5 g table salt
Wyeast 1099 (Whitbread Ale) or SafAle S-04 yeast
2⁄3 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by step
Bring 3 gallons (11 L) of water to about 150 °F (66 °C), put the specialty grains in a muslin bag and steep them for 15–20 minutes. Remove the bag, allowing the liquid to drain thoroughly then stir in the extracts, making sure they are thoroughly dissolved before proceeding. Add hot water to bring the volume up to 5.5 gallons (21 L) and boil for 60 minutes, adding the hops and salt at the start. Cool to about 70 °F (21 °C) and pitch the yeast.

Ferment seven days at about 65 °F (18 °C), then rack to secondary for a further 5–7 days before racking to keg or bottling and carbonating to 2.0–2.5 psi. I recommend keeping this beer 3–4 weeks before drinking.

Note: I eliminated the flaked maize called for in the all-grain recipe so as to avoid the rather large partial mash that would be required. That meant this beer was somewhat more malty than the original, but that ensures
a good balance between the malt character and the bitterness from the black malt.

Brew Your Own's MC Hawking's Event Horizon (Raspberry Wheat)
Brew Your Own's MC Hawking's Event Horizon (Raspberry Wheat)
(5 gallons/19 L, extract with fruit)
OG = 1.044 (1.040 before fruit)FG = 1.011 IBU = 14
SRM = 4 (before fruit) ABV = 4.2%

Here's one we developed especially for this recipe collection. This beer takes less than 90 minutes to make on brewday. For best results, follow the instructions closely — even though some of the steps are a bit unusual. MC Hawking's Event Horizon is a crisp, wheat beer accentuated by the raspberries, which add a tart, fruity note. This beer will disappear like it's been sucked into a black hole.

Ingredients
2.0 lbs. (0.91 kg) Briess Wheat dried malt extract
3.3 lbs. (1.5 kg) Coopers Wheat malt extract (liquid, canned)
6.0 lbs. (2.7 kg) frozen raspberries
6 AAU Perle hops (30 mins) (0.86 oz./24 g of 7 % alpha acids)
1 tsp Irish moss
1/4 tsp yeast nutrients
DCL Safale US-56 (dried yeast)
Wyeast 3068 (Weihenstephan Wheat) or White Labs WLP300 (Hefeweizen) yeast
1.2 cups corn sugar (for priming)

Step by Step
Use distilled or soft water. Heat 2 gallons (7.6 L) of water to a boil, then turn off heat. Stir in dried malt extract and bring to a boil. Add hops and boil for 30 minutes, adding Irish moss and yeast nutrients with 15 minutes left in boil. Shut off heat. Wipe off the outside of malt extract can with a paper towel soaked in sanitizing solution, then open and pour extract into hot wort. Sanitize a spoon to get the last bit of extract out of the can. Stir wort with this spoon until you think the extract is dissolved, then stir 1 minute longer. (The extract in the can is sterile, so there's no need to boil it for sanitation.) Cool wort immediately and transfer to fermenter. Add water to make 5 gallons (19 L) and aerate. (The specific gravity at this point will be 1.040.) Pitch both dried and liquid yeasts and ferment at 72 °F (22 °C). After primary fermentation ends (in 3–4 days), sanitize a bucket and add frozen raspberries. Mash raspberries with sanitized potato masher, then rack beer on top of them. (There's no need to heat the raspberries to sanitize them.) Place lid loosely on bucket, but don't seal until foaming from fruit subsides (usually 2–3 days). Seal bucket and let beer sit in contact with fruit for 10 days total. Bottle with corn sugar or keg and carbonate to 2.8–3.0 volumes of CO2.

White Labs WLP051 (California V Ale) or Wyeast 1272 (American Ale II) yeast
3/4 cups corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Mash the grains at 152 °F (67 °C). Vorlaf until your runnings are clear, sparge, and then boil the wort for 60 minutes. Add the hops at the times indicated in the ingredients list. After the boil, turn off the heat and chill the wort rapidly to 68 °F (20 C). Aerate the wort well and pitch the yeast. Ferment at 68–70 °F (20–21 °C). When the beer has reached final gravity, bottle or keg as normal.

Extract with Grains Option:
Omit the British pale ale and crystal (60 °L) malts. Add 6.6 lbs. (3.0 kg) Coopers amber liquid malt extract and 1.0 lb. (0.45 kg) Muntons amber dried malt extract. Steep the crushed chocolate malt and roasted black barley in 2 qts. (~2 L) of water at 150 °F (66 °C) for 30 minutes. Remove the bag, and add water to the pot to make 3 gallons (11 L). Add the dried malt extract to the wort and bring to a boil. Boil for 60 minutes trying to keep the wort topped up to 3 gallons (11 L). Add the hops at the times indicated in the ingredients list. Add the liquid malt extract for last 15 minutes of boil. After the boil, cool the wort, transfer to a fermenter and top off with cool water to reach 5 gallons (19 L). Aerate and pitch yeast. Follow the remainder of the all-grain recipe.

(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.036 (8.9 °P) FG = 1.011 (2.8 °P)
IBU = 17 SRM = 22 ABV = 3.2%

Ingredients
6.25 lb. (2.83 kg) Crisp British pale ale malt or similar (3 °L)
5 oz. (142 g) crystal malt (60 °L)
5 oz. (142 g) crystal malt (120 °L)
4 oz. (113 g) black patent malt (525 °L)
4 oz. (113 g) pale chocolate malt (200 °L)
3.5 AAU East Kent Goldings hops (60 min.)(0.7 oz./20 g at 5% alpha acids)
White Labs WLP002 (English Ale), Wyeast 1968 (London ESB Ale) or Fermentis Safale S-04 yeast

Step by Step
Mill the grains and dough-in targeting a mash of around 1.5 quarts of water to 1 pound of grain (a liquor-to-grist ratio of about 3:1 by weight) and a temperature of 154 °F (68 °C). Hold the mash at 154 °F (68 °C) until enzymatic conversion is complete. Infuse the mash with near boiling water while stirring or with a recirculating mash system raise the temperature to mash out at 168 °F (76 °C). Sparge slowly with 170 °F (77 °C) water, collecting wort until the pre-boil kettle volume is around 5.9 gallons (22.3 L) and the gravity is 1.030 (7.6 °P).

Once the wort is boiling, add the bittering hops. The total wort boil time is 1 hour after adding the bittering hops. During that time add the Irish moss or other kettle finings with 15 minutes left in the boil. Chill the wort to 67 °F (19 °C) and aerate thoroughly. The proper pitch rate is 6 grams of properly rehydrated dry yeast or 1 package of liquid yeast.

Ferment around 67 °F (19 °C) until the yeast drops clear. With healthy yeast, fermentation should be complete in a week or less. Allow the lees to settle and the brew to mature without pressure for another two days after fermentation appears finished. Rack to a keg and force carbonate or rack to a bottling bucket, add priming sugar, and bottle. Target a carbonation level of 1 to 2 volumes depending on your packaging. Serve at 50 to 55 °F (10 to 13 °C).

Ingredients
4.25 lb. (1.92 kg) Maris Otter English pale liquid malt extract
5 oz. (142 g) crystal malt (60 °L)
5 oz. (142 g) crystal malt (120 °L)
4 oz. (113 g) black patent (525 °L)
4 oz. (113 g) pale chocolate malt (200 °L)
3.5 AAU East Kent Goldings hops (60 min.) (0.7 oz./20 g at 5% alpha acids)
White Labs WLP002 (English Ale ), Wyeast 1968 (London ESB Ale) or Fermentis Safale S-04 yeast

Step by Step
Always choose the freshest extract that fits the beer style instead of focusing on the brand name. If you can’t get fresh liquid malt extract, it is better to use about 3.4 lb (1.5 kg) dried malt extract (DME) instead.

Mill or coarsely crack the specialty malt and place loosely in a grain bag. Avoid packing the grains too tightly in the bag, using more bags if needed. Steep the bag in about 1 gallon (~4 liters) of water at roughly 170 °F (77 °C) for about 30 minutes. Lift the grain bag out of the steeping liquid and rinse with warm water. Allow the bags to drip into the kettle for a few minutes while you add the malt extract. Do not squeeze the bags. Add enough water to the steeping liquor and malt extract to make a pre-boil volume of 5.9 gallons (22.3 L) and a gravity of 1.031 (7.7 °P). Stir thoroughly to help dissolve the extract and bring to a boil.

Once the wort is boiling, add the bittering hops. The total wort boil time is 1 hour after adding the bittering hops. During that time add the Irish moss or other kettle finings with 15 minutes left in the boil. Follow the fermentation and packaging instructions for the all-grain version.

British Golden Ale
British Golden Ale
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.044 FG = 1.011
IBU = 34 SRM = 6 ABV = 4.3%

This recipe is a bit of an unorthodox take on the style in that it uses Vienna malt and some lighter crystal malts, and mixes in some Czech-like hops. But the final flavor profile is very much in line with the better examples of British golden ale that I’ve tried, and it helps show that you can do a bit of fusion of different brewing styles and cultures to create a modern beer. Coming in on the smaller side of ABV, it’s a great beer for the summer or when looking for a session beer.

Ingredients
5 lbs. (2.3 kg) UK Golden Promise malt
2 lbs. (0.9 kg) German Vienna malt
1 lb. (0.45 kg) flaked maize
8 oz. (227 g) torrified wheat
6 oz. (170 g) Belgian caramel malt (45 °L)
4 oz. (113 g) Carapils® malt
6 AAU UK First Gold hops (first wort hop) (0.75 oz./21 g at 8% alpha acids)
7 AAU US Sterling hops (5 min.) (1 oz./28 g at 7% alpha acids)
0.75 oz. (21 g) US Sterling hops (0 min.)
1.25 oz. (35 g) US Sterling hops (dry hop)
0.25 oz. (7 g) UK First Gold hops (dry hop)
Wyeast 1335 (British Ale II) or WhiteLabs WLP022 (Essex Ale) yeast
2⁄3 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Two or three days before brew day, make a 1-qt. (1-L) yeast starter, aerating the wort thoroughly (preferably with oxygen) before pitching the yeast.

On brew day, prepare your ingredients; mill the grain, measure your hops, and prepare your water. This recipe uses reverse osmosis (RO) water. Add 1⁄4 tsp 10% phosphoric acid per 5 gallons (19 L) of brewing water, or until water measures pH 5.5 at room temperature. Add 1 tsp. calcium chloride (CaCl2) to the mash. Mash in the Golden Promise and Vienna malts and the flaked corn and torrified wheat at 155 °F (68 °C) in 13 qts. (12 L) of water, and hold this temperature
for 60 minutes. Raise the temperature by infusion or direct heating to 168 °F (76 °C) to mashout. Add the remaining crystal malts, and recirculate for 20 minutes. Add first wort hops to the brew kettle then fly sparge with 168 °F (76 °C) water until 6.5 gallons (25 L) of wort is collected. Boil the wort for 75 minutes, adding the hops at times indicated in the recipe. The zero minute hops are added when the heat is turned off. Give the wort a strong stir and then cover and let stand for 20 minutes. This technique is called whirlpool hopping and emphasizes the finished hop profile.

Chill the wort to 66 °F (19 °C). Oxygenate, then pitch the yeast starter. Ferment at 66 °F (19 °C) until fermentation is complete. Dry hop the beer for 3–5 days at room temperature and then proceed to rack the beer. Prime and bottle condition, or keg and force carbonate to 2.2 volumes.

Two or three days before brew day, make a 1-qt. (1-L) yeast starter, aerating the wort thoroughly (preferably with oxygen) before pitching the yeast.

Use 6 gallons (23 L) of water in the brew kettle; heat to 158 °F (70 °C). Place the crystal malts in a mesh bag and steep in the hot water for 30 minutes. Remove the mesh bag, then turn the heat off. Add the liquid malt extract and stir thoroughly to dissolve the extract completely. You do not want to feel liquid extract at the bottom of the kettle when stirring with your spoon. Add the first wort hops. Turn the heat back on and bring to a boil. Boil the wort for 60 minutes, adding the hops at the times indicated in the recipe. The zero minute hops are added when the heat is turned off. Give the wort a strong stir and then cover and let stand for 20 minutes. This technique is called whirlpool hopping and emphasizes the finished hop profile.

Chill the wort to 66 °F (19 °C). Oxygenate, then pitch the yeast starter. Ferment at 66 °F (19 °C) until fermentation is complete. Dry hop the beer for 3–5 days at room temperature and then proceed to rack the beer. Prime and bottle condition, or keg and force carbonate to 2.2 volumes.

Pale Mild
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.036 (9.0 °P) FG = 1.011 (2.8 °P)
IBU = 18 SRM = 10 ABV = 3.3%

Ingredients
6.6 lb. (3 kg) Crisp British pale ale malt or similar substitute (3 °L)
6 oz. (170 g) crystal malt (120 °L)
6 oz. (170 g) Carastan malt (30 °L)
2.1 AAU Challenger hops (0.42 oz./ 12 g at 8% alpha acids) (60 min.)
1.25 AAU East Kent Goldings hops, (0.25 oz./7 g at 5% alpha acids) (15 min.)
White Labs WLP002 (English Ale), Wyeast 1968 (London ESB Ale) or Fermentis Safale S-04 yeast

Step by Step
Mill the grains and dough-in targeting a mash of around 1.5 quarts of water to 1 pound of grain (a liquor-to-grist ratio of about 3:1 by weight) and a temperature of 154 °F (68 °C). Hold the mash at 154 °F (68 °C) until enzymatic conversion is complete. Infuse the mash with near boiling water while stirring or with a recirculating mash system raise the temperature to mash out at 168 °F (76 °C). Sparge slowly with 170 °F (77 °C) water, collecting wort until the pre-boil kettle volume is around 5.9 gallons (22.3 L) and the gravity is 1.031 (7.7 °P).

Once the wort is boiling, add the bittering hops. The total wort boil time is one hour after adding the bittering hops. During that time add the Irish moss or other kettle finings and the last hop addition with 15 minutes left in the boil. Chill the wort to 67 °F (19 °C) and aerate thoroughly. The proper pitch rate is 6 grams of properly rehydrated dry yeast or 1 package of liquid yeast.

Ferment around 67 °F (19 °C) until the yeast drops clear. With healthy yeast, fermentation should be complete in a week or less. Allow the lees to settle and the brew to mature without pressure for another two days after fermentation appears finished. Rack to a keg and force carbonate or rack to a bottling bucket, add priming sugar, and bottle. Target a carbonation level of 1 to 2 volumes depending on your packaging. Serve at 50 to 55 °F (10 to 13 °C).

Brooklyn Lager is Brooklyn Brewery’s flagship beer. It is loosely based on the old Vienna lager style, derivations of which were popular in parts of the United States in the late 1800s. Its bitterness is snappy, with a firm malt core, and the beer is dry hopped.

INGREDIENTS
9 lb. 6 oz (4.25 kg) American 2-row pale malt
14 oz. (0.40 kg) Munich malt (10°L)
11 oz. (0.31 kg) caramel malt (60°L)
4.6 AAU Willamette hops (75 mins.) (1 oz./28 g of 4.6% alpha acids)
2.5 AAU Cascade hops (35 mins.) (0.33 oz./9.3 g of 7.5% alpha acids)
2.5 AAU Vanguard hops (35 mins.) (0.45 oz./13 g of 5.6% alpha acids)
0.5 oz. (14 g) Hallertau Mittelfrueh hops (2 mins.)
0.5 oz. (14 g) Saphir hops (2 mins.)
0.5 oz. (14 g) Cascade hops (2 mins.)
0.75 oz. (21 g) Cascade hops (dry hops)
1.5 oz. (42 g) Hallertauer Mittelfrueh hops (dry hops)
White Labs WLP833 (German Bock Lager) yeast

STEP BY STEP
Mash the grains at 118°F (47°C) for 20 minutes. Ramp up to 135°F (57°C) and hold for 5 minutes. To reach the saccharification temperature of 156°F (69°C), there are two methods, depending on your equipment. If your heat source can raise the temperature of the mash rapidly (in 5 to 10 minutes), then do so. If not, add 200°F (93°C) water to the mash, stirring vigorously to avoid hot spots, until you reach the target temperature. (American 2-row pale malt is diastatically powerful, and if the mash isn’t heated quickly enough, the resulting wort will be too fermentable.) Hold for 35 minutes at 156°F (69°C), then ramp up to mash out at 170°F (77°C). Vorlauf and then sparge at 170°F (77°C) until you’ve collected enough wort (gravity should be 13°P/1.053 SG). Boil for 75 minutes, adding the hops as instructed. (Brooklyn Brewery’s boil is 15 minutes longer, but boiling longer over a direct flame would result in too much color development). If necessary, adjust the volume to 5 gallons (19 L). Cool to 55°F (13°C) and pitch the yeast. Once activity has clearly started (approximately 24 hours for lagers), ferment at 52°F (11°C). As activity subsides toward the end of fermentation, allow a free rise to 60°F (16°C) over 48 hours. Once the fermentation is finished, bring the temperature to 36°F (2.2°C) for lagering. After 1 week at 36°F (2.2°C), add the dry hops and hold for 10 days. Bottle or keg as usual.

EXTRACT WITH GRAINS OPTION:
Scale the American 2-row pale malt down to 7 ounces (0.2 kg) and add 2 pounds (0.91 kg) Briess light dried malt extract and 4 pounds (1.8 kg) Briess light liquid malt extract to the ingredients list. Place the crushed grains in a steeping bag and steep in 3 quarts (2.8 L) of water in your brewpot at 154°F (68°C) for 60 minutes. Lift the grain bag and place it in a colander suspended over the brewpot. Rinse the grains with 1.5 quarts (1.4 L) of 170°F (77°C) water. Add water to the "grain tea" to make at least 3.5 gallons (13 L), then dissolve the dried malt extract and bring to a boil. Boil for 75 minutes, adding the hops at the times indicated. Stir in the liquid malt extract during the final 15 minutes of the boil. Chill, then top up with filtered water to reach 5 gallons (19 L). Follow the remaining portion of the all-grain recipe.

Brooklyn Brewery: Brooklyn Monster Ale
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.100 FG = 1.020
IBU = 47 SRM = 15 ABV= 10.2%

Brooklyn Monster Ale was first brewed in 1997. It is midway between the old British barleywine style and more modern variants. Much of this beer’s essential character comes from the use of Maris Otter floor malts, but the residual sugar is relatively low.

Ingredients
13 lb. 4 oz. (6 kg) GlenEagles Maris Otter malt
3 lb. 12 oz. (1.7 kg) Crisp pale ale malt
8 oz. (0.23 kg) caramel malt (60 °L)
3 oz. (85 g) chocolate malt
14 oz. (0.40 kg) cane sugar
9.2 AAU Willamette hops (120 min.)
(2 oz./56 g at 4.6% alpha acids)
6.25 AAU Cascade hops (60 min.)
(0.9 oz./26 g at 7% alpha acids)
3.5 oz. (99 g) English Fuggle hops (3 min.)
1 tsp. Irish moss (10 min.)
White Labs WLP001 (California Ale) or Wyeast 1056 (American Ale) yeast
5/8 cups (125 g) dextrose (if priming)

Step by Step
Mash the grains at 154 °F (68 °C) and hold for 90 minutes. Bring mash to 168 °F (76 °C) to mash off. Sparge slowly and carefully. Collect 5 gallons (19 L) wort at 1.092 SG. Heat to 205 °F (96 °C), stir in cane sugar, to reach 1.100. Boil ends at 120 minutes. Adjust volume, if necessary, to 5 gallons (19 L). Cool to 58 °F (14 °C), aerate well, and pitch yeast at twice the rate that you would for pale ale. Ferment at 67 °F (19 °C). After fermentation is complete, cool if possible. If beer must wait more than one week after active fermentation has ceased before packaging, transfer to secondary. Age in bottle or keg for not less than three months before serving.

Partial mash option
:Reduce the Maris Otter malt in the all-grain version to 2.5 lbs. (1.1 kg) and pale ale malt to 13 oz. (0.37 kg). This recipe also uses 3 lbs. (1.4 kg) Muntons light dried malt extract and 7 lbs. (3.2 kg) Muntons light liquid malt extract. Place the crushed grains in a large steeping bag. Place bag inside a 2-gallon (~8 L) beverage cooler. Stir 5.5 qts. (5.2 L) of water at 167 °F (75 °C) into the grains. Let rest for 60 minutes. The temperature should drop to 154 °F (68 °C) at the end of the rest. After the mash, vorlauf, and then sparge at 170 °F (77 °C). Collect 4 gallons (15 L) or as much volume as your brewpot will handle. Stir in dried malt extract and boil wort for 120 minutes. Add the hops at times indicated in the recipe. Add the table sugar and liquid malt extract in last 15 minutes of the boil. If boil volume dips below 3.5 gallons (13 L), bring volume back up with boiling water. Follow the remaining portion of the all-grain recipe.

1.5 oz. (43 g) East Kent Golding hops (0 min.)
Wyeast 1968 (London ESB) or White Labs WLP002 (English Ale) or Lallemand Windsor yeast
7/8 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Adjust your brewing water with calcium chloride to reach 2:1 chloride to sulfate ratio. Mill the grains, then mix with 5.5 gallons (20.7 L) strike water to reach 122 °F (50 °C) and hold for 10 minutes, then raise to 154 °F (68 °C) and hold for 45 minutes. Mash out at 170 °F (77 °C), then proceed to vorlauf and sparge. If you don’t want to perform a step mash, you can utilize a single infusion mash by mixing 5.5 gallons (20.7 L) of 165 °F (74°C) strike water to reach a mash temperature of 152 °F (67 °C). Hold this temperature for 60 minutes. Vorlauf until your runnings are clear, and lauter.

Sparge the grains with enough water obtain 7 gallons (26.5 L) of wort. Stir in demerara sugar until dissolved. Boil for 90 minutes, adding hops and yeast nutrients according to the ingredient list and Irish moss if desired.

After the boil, chill the wort to slightly below fermentation temperature, about 65 °F (18 °C). Aerate the wort with pure oxygen or filtered air and pitch yeast. Ferment at 66 °F (19 °C), for the first seven days, then free rise to 70 °F (21 °C) and hold there until the completion of primary fermentation. Once the beer completes fermentation, transfer off of yeast.

Rack beer into a 5-gallon (19 L) heat-pasteurized white oak Bourbon barrel. Age for not less than six months at cellar temperatures (52 °F/11 °C). If you don’t have an oak barrel, you can alternatively rack beer into a secondary fermenter and add bourbon-soaked medium toast American oak chips (1 oz./5 gallons). Chips should be soaked for two weeks, then discard the liquid and add the wet chips to the beer. Age for not less than six months at cellar temperatures (52 °F/11 °C).

When complete, bottle. Re-fermentation in the bottle using 10 g/L of dextrose and 1.2 M/cells/mL of either Lallemand CBC-1 or Lalvin EC1118.

Tips for Success:
Brooklyn Brewmaster Garrett Oliver is genuinely excited to see what homebrewers can do with this recipe! He provided the brewery’s own ingredients and process, which I have done my best to replicate here, with as few adjustments as possible. Some, though, may be necessary.

Brooklyn step mashes this beer, so purists are welcome to do so, but single-infusion mash folks should be able to get similar results with a standard mash. The grist is not particularly exotic, but I wanted to present the brewery-authentic temperatures as well, in the interest of full disclosure!

The other major deviation will be in the oak aging step. This may be a good time invest in a five-gallon Bourbon cask, or procure a standard barrel and brew this one with a number of friends in order to fill it. If you choose not to, however, you can mimic the barrel-aged flavor using chips or cubes, as noted above. What I would also recommend, though, is aging in a standard bottling bucket. One significant flavor-developer in barrel-aged beers is the slow micro-oxidation of the beer, which a glass- or steel-aged beer might miss out on slightly. Most plastic fermentation buckets, though, are oxygen-permeable and might actually create a more authentic beer.

Good luck – and please feel to let Garrett and Brooklyn Brewery know how yours turned out!

Brooklyn Pennant Pale Ale ’55 clone
(5 gallons/19 L, extract with grains)
OG = 1.055 FG = 1.015
SRM = 11 IBU = 30 ABV = 5%

Ingredients
11 oz. (0.31 kg) U.S. crystal malt (80° L)
4 oz. (113 g) Belgian biscuit malt
6 lbs. (2.7 kg) extra-light dry malt extract (DME)
7 oz. (200 g) maltodextrin powder
6 AAUs Willamette hops (60 min.) (1.5 oz./43 g at 4% alpha acid)
5 AAUs East Kent Goldings hops (15 min.)(1 oz./28 g at 5% alpha acid)
2.5 AAUs East Kent Goldings hops (1 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 5% alpha acid)
1 tsp. Irish moss for 15 minutes
Wyeast 1968 (London ESB) or White Labs WLP002 (English Ale) or Lallemand London ESB Ale yeast
3/4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by step
Bring 1/2 gallon (2 L) of water to 155 °F (68 °C), add crushed grain and hold for 30 minutes at 150 °F (66 °C). Strain the grain into the brewpot and wash with one gallon (3.8 L) of 168 °F (76 °C) water. Add the DME, maltodextrin and first hop addition. Bring the total volume in the brewpot to 3 gallons (11 L). Boil for 45 minutes, then add the second round of hops and Irish moss.

Boil for 14 minutes, then add the final hops addition. Boil for 1 minute, then remove the pot from the stove. Cool wort for 15 minutes in an ice bath or chill with wort chiller. Strain into the primary fermenter and add water to obtain 5.25 gallons (20 L). Add yeast when wort has cooled to below 80 °F (27 °C).

Oxygenate-aerate well. Ferment at 68 °F (20 °C) for 7 days, then rack into secondary. Ferment until target gravity has been reached and beer has cleared (approximately 3 weeks). Keg and force carbonate or prime and bottle. If bottling, carbonate at 70 to 72 °F (21 to 22 °C) for 2 to 3 weeks. This ale is ready to drink 1 month after it is carbonated. It will peak between 1 and 3 months and last up to 6 months.

Partial-Mash:
Acidify the mash water to below 7 pH. Mash 2.33 lbs. (1 kg) British Maris Otter two-row pale malt and the specialty grains in 1 gallon (3.8 L) water at 150 °F (66 °C) for 90 minutes.

¾ cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Mill the grains, then mix with 4.2 gallons (15.7 L) of 169 °F (76 °C) strike water to achieve a single infusion rest temperature of 154 °F (68 °C). Hold at this temperature for 60 minutes. Vorlauf until your runnings are clear before directing them to your boil kettle. Batch or fly sparge the mash to obtain 6.5 gallons (24.6 L) of wort.

Boil for 60 minutes, adding the Summit™ hops at the beginning of the boil. At 10 minutes left in boil, add a kettle fining agent such as Irish moss or a Whirlfloc tablet and a yeast nutrient of your choice.

After the boil, rapidly chill the wort to slightly below fermentation temperature, which is 66 °F (19 °C) for this beer. Aerate the wort (if using a liquid strain) then pitch the yeast.

Maintain a steady temperature for the duration of active fermentation. Once primary fermentation is done, rack into a secondary fermenter containing the raspberries and cherries. If you have access to carbonation, try to purge the receiving vessel. Allow for complete fermentation of the fruit, which can take up to two weeks.

Bottle or keg the beer and carbonate to approximately 2.5 volumes.

Tips for Success:
This month’s tips all come straight from the brewer, Duncan MacCrea’s pen. First off, "We do a single infusion mash at 154 °F (68 °C), which may seem high for the target final gravity but we do not raise the temperature at the end of the mash to denature the enzymes, we simply allow conversion to continue through lautering and found the higher temperature necessary to not overshoot target final gravity. If you intend to raise the temperature at the end of mashing to denature the enzymes, you will likely find you need a lower target mash temperature to achieve the desired final gravity."

Secondly, "We once used raspberries and tart cherries in equal proportion but found that reducing the cherries kept the cough syrup flavor from coming through. Be sure to use tart cherries, not sweet cherries. Any amount of sweet cherries tastes like cough syrup after the sugar has fermented out. The fruit is added after the beer has been racked off the yeast into a conditioning tank. This allows time for the sugars of the fruit to ferment without the delicate aromas to be driven off by the vigor of primary fermentation. We centrifuge this beer for clarity but if a centrifuge is not found in your homebrewery, pectic enzyme can aid with clarification."

Finally, "Any fruit beer, short of some Belgian sour styles, are not intended to be aged and should be consumed fresh. This is no exception. We generally brew, ferment, condition, centrifuge, package, and send this beer out the door within three weeks. Ideally, it spends as little time as possible on the shelf and is consumed fresh."

IBU = 30 SRM = 30  ABV = 11%

The specifications for this English-style barleywine are all pre-barrel aging numbers. After aging in a bourbon barrel, the beer is above 13% ABV.

Ingredients
17 lbs. (7.7 kg) Great Western 2-row pale malt
1.9 lbs. (0.86 kg) Briess Bonlander® Munich malt (10 °L)
0.4 lb. (181 g) Castle Abbey® malt (17 °L)
0.3 lb. (136 g) Castle chocolate malt (340 °L)
13.5 AAU UK Challenger hops (60 min.) (1.4 oz./40 g at 9.6% alpha acids)
1⁄2 tsp. yeast nutrient (10 min.)
1⁄2 Whirlfloc® tablet (10 min.)
Bourbon soaked oak cubes
White Labs WLP001 (California Ale) or Wyeast 1056 (American Ale) or Safale US-05 yeast
3⁄4 cup (150 g) dextrose (if priming)

Step by Step
Mill the grains and dough-in targeting a mash of around 1.25 quarts of water to 1 pound of grain (2.6 L/kg) and a temperature of 150 °F (66 °C). Hold the mash at 150 °F (66 °C) for 60 minutes. Sparge slowly with 170 °F (77 °C) water, collecting wort until the pre-boil kettle volume is 7 gallons (26.5 L). Boil 120 minutes, adding ingredients as indicated. Chill to 65 °F (18 °C) and aerate thoroughly. The yeast pitch rate is 1,000,000 cells per mL per degree Plato. On a homebrew scale, this is approximately three packages of liquid yeast. For the wood aging, The Bruery’s Experimental Brewer Andrew Bell says, "after primary fermentation is finished, rack the beer to a CO2-purged, first-use bourbon barrel (or as an alternative, add bourbon soaked oak cubes to the beer in a secondary fermenter). Age the beer on the oak until a refined bourbon character is achieved (approximately one year on a commercial scale, usually less on a smaller scale depending on the surface area of your oak source). After aging, bottle or keg as normal, carbonating the beer to around 2.5 volumes of CO2 (forced carbonation would be easier with this high ABV beer)." If you plan to bottle condition, you may consider pitching some fresh yeast at bottling.

Partial mash option:
Reduce the 2-row pale malt in the all-grain recipe to 2 lbs. (0.91 kg) and add 10 lbs. (4.5 kg) golden liquid malt extract. Place crushed grains in a large muslin bag. Heat 2 gallons (7.6 L) water and target a mash temperature of 150 °F (66 °C). Add the grain bag and hold the mash at 150 °F (66 °C) until enzymatic conversion is complete, about 60 minutes. Remove the grain bag and slowly wash the grains with 2 gallons (7.6 L) of hot water. Add the liquid malt extract and top off to 7 gallons (26.5 L) in the brewpot. Follow the remaining portion of the all-grain recipe.

This beer was one of the original beers brewed at The Bruery, but is now brewed under their Bruery Terreux label. It is an unfiltered, bottle conditioned Belgian-stule farmhouse ale.

Ingredients
7.5 lbs. (3.4 kg) Great Western 2-row pale malt
3.5 lbs. (1.6 kg) Weyermann rye malt
4.8 oz. (136 g) Bairds brown malt
1.9 lbs. (0.86 kg) dextrose sugar (0 min.)
9.8 AAU German Magnum hops (first wort hop) (0.64 oz./18 g at 15.2% alpha acids)
3.9 AAU Sterling hops (0 min.) (0.55 oz./16 g at 7.1% alpha acids)
0.2 oz. (6 g) dried spearmint leaves (20 min.)
1⁄2 Whirlfloc® tablet (10 min.)
1⁄2 tsp. yeast nutrients (10 min.)
White Labs WLP570 (Belgian Golden Ale) or Wyeast 1388 (Belgian Strong Ale) or The Bruery’s house yeast strain (see "Tips for Success")
Your favorite strain of Brettanomyces bruxellensis
7⁄8 cup (175 g) dextrose (if priming)

Step by Step
Mill the grains and dough-in, targeting a mash of around 1.3 quarts of water to 1 pound of grain and a temperature of 150 °F (66 °C). Hold the mash at 150 °F (66 °C) until enzymatic conversion is complete. Sparge slowly with 170 °F (77 °C) water, collecting wort until the pre-boil kettle volume is 6 gallons (23 L). Add first wort hops towards the beginning of the lauter. Boil time is 60 minutes, adding the mint with 20 minutes left in the boil. Add Whirlfloc® and yeast nutrient with 10 minutes left in the boil. At flameout, start a whirlpool and add the whirlpool hops and dextrose. After a 20-minute whirlpool, chill the wort to 65 °F (18 °C) and aerate thoroughly. Pitch rate is 750,000 cells per mL per degree Plato, or approximately 2 packages of liquid yeast. Allow the fermentation to raise the overall fermentation temperature to 85 °F (29 °C). When time to package, pitch 2 million cells per mL of Brett Brux to the bottling bucket and prime to bottle condition. Aim to carbonate the beer to around 2.8 volumes of CO2 (the conditioning with Brett will likely make it higher over time, use sturdy bottles meant to withstand high volumes of CO2).

Extract only option:
Substitute all of the malts in the all-grain recipe with 3 lbs. (1.36 kg) extra light dried malt extract and 3.3 lbs. (1.5 kg) rye liquid malt extract. Add 6 gallons (23 L) of water to your kettle and start to bring to a boil. When the temperature reaches about 180 °F (82 °C), add the first wort hops. When the water comes to a boil, remove from the heat and add the dried and liquid malt extracts, and stir thoroughly to dissolve the extract completely. Turn the heat back on boil for 60 minutes. Follow the remaining portion of the all-grain recipe.

Tips for Success:
The Bruery’s Experimental Brewer Andrew Bell states, "Saison Rue is one of the first beers we ever produced. It was batch 4 for us (3/17/2008), and it has changed some over the years. It has always had mint and Brett. The malt has always been a blend of 2-row, rye and a small percentage of some sort of highly toasted malt (we used Special Roast in 2008, but from April 2009 onwards we have been using brown malt, usually between 1–2%). Explore different malt bills in similar percentages! Rye is sticky! Saison Rue is usually not a problem beer for us, but depending on your system, rice hulls would probably be a good idea. We tend to mash on the more acidic side of things. Initially the sugar addition in the whirlpool was a house-made inverted sugar. Since July 2009 we have used dextrose.

"Knockout and fermentation temperatures have changed over time. We used to start with a very cold knockout (50–55 °F/10–13 °C) and let it free rise up to 85 °F (29 °C). The ramping up of temperature during ferment (starting cold) lets our proprietary house yeast produce a more interesting phenol and ester saison profile than if we were to maintain one temperature during fermentation (would just taste more Belgian-y). Currently we KO at 65 °F (18 °C) and allow to free rise to 85 °F (29 °C).

"Our house yeast that we use for primary fermentation is proprietary, but could be harvested from some of our other bottles (fresh Trade Winds or Jardinier or Mischief would be good places to start). White Labs WLP570 is probably the closest commercial example, but will probably behave differently. You can experiment with adding Lactobacillus (we are experimenting with this with our new Terreux Sour/Farmhouse Brand). Personal preference on yeast supplier of Brett Brux used at packaging. Experiment with other/multiple varieties of Brett. Target CO2 at release is 2.8 volumes, but as it ages it keeps picking up carbonation (well above 3 volumes). Use appropriately thick glass if bottling!

"The mint addition is inspired by several different mildly spiced traditional Belgian saisons (including beers from Brasserie Vapeur). We also use the mint as a self-check mechanism to ensure that we do not release Saison Rue too early. Patrick likes to say that if you can still taste mint over the Brett, then it is not ready to release. We usually bottle condition for 6 months prior to release. If using fresh herbs, you would need a higher dosage rate."

This is a single infusion mash. Heat 4.78 gallons (18.1 L) of strike water to 169 °F (76 °C) to stabilize the grain bed at 152 °F (67 °C) and hold for 60 minutes. Double-batch sparge with 5.13 gallons (19.4 L) of water to to raise the mash bed to 168 °F (76 °C).

Bring the wort to a boil and boil for 60 minutes, adding gypsum directly to the boil and add the hops as indicated in the ingredients list. Cool the wort to 67 °F (19 °C), oxygenate well, and pitch the yeast. Ferment for 10 days at 67 °F (19 °C). Once the primary fermentation is complete transfer the beer to a secondary, add the dry hops and wait seven days. Bottle or keg as normal.

Step by Step
Use a single-step infusion mash at 153–155 °F (67–68 °C) for 1–1.5 hours. Sparge one hour, with water no hotter than 175 °F (79 °C), until run-off reaches SG 1.010–1.012. Boil 90 minutes, with bittering hops added after the first foamy head subsides. Add flavor hops 10 minutes before the end of the boil. Adjust wort volume with cold water, and cool to about 70 °F (21 °C). Pitch with yeast starter, and allow to ferment. By 5–7 days, final gravity should have been reached; if so, rack into a glass fermenter. One to two weeks later, rack again, prime with corn sugar and package in keg or bottles. The beer should be ready to drink after conditioning for a week or so. Add the dry hops (if any), preferably to the primary fermenter or else to the keg. In either case, the hops should be placed in a sterilized muslin bag, with a sterilized weight attached.

Buried Acorn Brewing Co.’s Stoutland clone
This recipe tiptoes the line between what is acceptable as a stout and an entirely new combination of flavors. The tangy kveik esters bouncing off of all the chocolate and a pretty robust hopping rate make for a very angular and unique stout.

(5 gallon/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.048 FG = 1.014
IBU = 30 SRM = 47 ABV = 4.5%

Ingredients
2.5 lbs. (1.13 kg) 1886 NY pale ale malt
2.5 lbs. (1.13 kg) 1886 NY Munich malt (or Munich 1)
1.5 lbs. (0.68 kg) 1886 NY Vienna malt
0.75 lb. (0.34 kg) Bairds medium crystal malt (75 °)
0.75 lb. (0.34 kg) Crisp pale chocolate malt (225 °L)
0.75 lb. (0.34 kg) Bairds light crystal malt (15 °L)
0.75 lb. (0.34 kg) Crisp dark chocolate malt (450 °L)
0.75 lb. (0.34 kg) flaked oats
5 oz. (142 g) roasted barley malt
3.75 AAU French Strisselspalt (90 min.) (1.5 oz./43 g at 2.5% alpha acids)
3.25 oz. (92 g) French Strisselspalt (0 min.)
0.65 oz. (18 g) Cascade hops (dry hop)
0.65 oz. (18 g) Chinook hops (dry hop)
Omega Yeast OYL057 (Hothead Ale)
2/3 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by step
Make sure the alkalinity of your water can buffer the heavy-handed specialty malts. Water should be roughly 1:1 sulfate-to-chloride with about 50 ppm calcium ion.

Mash in grains at 152 °F (67 °C) for 60 minutes. Raise grain bed to 168 °F (76 °C) to begin the lauter process. Vorlauf and sparge as normal. Collect about 6.5 gallons (25 L) of wort in your kettle and bring to a boil. Add the first hop addition and boil for 90 minutes. At the end of boil, add the second hop addition and create a whirlpool. Buried Acorn spins for 15 minutes, then spins down for 30 minutes. If you have a pump you can follow this as well. Otherwise create a whirlpool and let settle for 30 minutes.

An addition of a yeast nutrient and proper oxygen/aeration prior to fermentation is important. Fermentation temperature is not critical — anywhere from 82–108 °F (28–42 °C) should work. Once primary fermentation is finished, allow the beer to settle for several days then package as normal.

This Belgian-style wit is brewed with apricot, and Pilsner malt to create a medium-bodied, tart beer with fresh fruit aroma.

Ingredients
7.5 lbs. (3.4 kg) Pilsner malt
3.75 lbs. (1.7 kg) white wheat malt
1.25 lbs. (0.56 kg) rye malt
12 oz. (0.34 kg) Caravienne malt (20 °L)
8 oz. (0.23 kg) corn sugar (10 min.)
5 lbs. (2.27 kg) apricot purée (secondary)
6.1 AAU Citra® hop pellets (60 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 12.2% alpha acids)
3 AAU Amarillo® hop pellets (60 min.) (0.3 oz./8.5 g at 10% alpha acids)
0.5 oz. (14 g) Citra® hop pellets (0 min.)
0.5 oz. (14 g) Amarillo® hop pellets (0 min.)
1⁄2 tsp. Irish moss (30 min.)
1⁄2 tsp. yeast nutrient (15 min.)
White Labs WLP566 (Belgian Saison II) or Wyeast 3711 (French Saison) or Lallemand Belle Saison yeast.
3⁄4 cup (150 g) dextrose (if priming)

Step by Step
This recipe is a single step infusion mash. Mix all of the crushed grains with 4.9 gallons (18.5 L) of 168 °F (76 °C) water to stabilize at 148 ºF (64 °C). This is a medium thin mash using 1.5 quarts of strike water per pound of grain (3.1 L/kg). Mash for 90 minutes, then slowly sparge with 175 °F (79 °C) water. Collect approximately 6.2 gallons (23.5 L) of wort runoff to boil for 90 minutes. While boiling, add the hops, Irish moss, yeast nutrient, and 10-minute corn sugar addition as per the schedule. After the boil is complete, cool the wort to 75 °F (24 °C). Pitch your yeast and aerate the wort heavily. Allow the beer to cool to 67 °F (19 °C). Hold at that temperature for the first two days and gradually ramp up to 76 °F (24°C) over the next 3–7 days. Hold at 76 °F (24°C) until fermentation is complete. This may take 10–14 days. Gently transfer to a carboy, avoiding any splashing to prevent aerating the beer and add the apricot purée. Allow the beer to condition for an additional week. Prime and bottle condition or keg and force carbonate to 2.8 volumes CO2. Allow the beer to age for two more weeks to fully develop the flavors.

Extract with grains option:
Substitute all of the malts in the all-grain recipe with 6.6 lbs. (3 kg) Coopers light liquid malt extract, 1.75 lbs. (0.79 kg) Pilsner malt, 12 oz. (0.34 kg) white wheat malt, 4 oz. (0.11 kg) rye malt, and 2 oz. (57 g) Caravienne malt (20 °L). Steep the milled grains in 2.5 gallons (9.5 L) of water at 148 °F (64 °C) for 30 minutes. Remove grains from the wort and rinse with 2 quarts (1.8 L) of hot water. Add the malt extract and boil for 60 minutes. Follow the remaining portion of the all-grain recipe.

Tips for Success:
If you are unable to locate apricot purée, whole apricots may be substituted in either the all-grain or the partial mash recipe. If using fresh apricots, discard the pit and cut the apricots into small slices. Immerse the slices in 190 °F (88 °C) water for two minutes to sterilize the fruit. Crush the slices and allow them to cool before adding them to the secondary fermenter.

Step by Step
Use a single-step infusion mash at 153–155 °F (67–68 °C) for 1–1.5 hours. Sparge one hour, with water no hotter than 175 °F (79 °C), until run-off reaches a specific gravity 1.010–1.012. Boil 90 minutes, with bittering hops added after the first foamy head subsides. Adjust wort volume with cold water, and cool to about 70 °F
(21 °C). Pitch with yeast starter, and allow to ferment. By 5–7 days, final gravity should have been reached; rack into a secondary fermenter. If you will be bottling, add dry hops at this stage. One to two weeks later, rack again, prime with corn sugar, and rack into keg or bottles. If you keg your beer, add dry hops at this stage. The beer should be ready to drink after conditioning for a week or so. It will keep for months if kept cool, and you have been careful to avoid aeration during racking.

IBU = 42 SRM = 18 ABV = 5.9%

Ingredients
6.6 lbs. (3.0 kg) Briess Light liquid malt extract
1 lb. (0.45 kg) Briess Light dried malt extract
7 oz. (2.0 kg) chocolate malt
3 oz. (85 g) Munich malt

White Labs WLP051 (California V Ale) or Wyeast 1272 (American Ale II) yeast
0.75 cup corn sugar (for priming)

Step by Step
Steep the two crushed grains in 3 gallons (11 L) of water at 150 ºF (65 ºC) for 30 minutes. Remove grains from wort, add malt syrup, dry malt extract and bring to a boil. Add Perle (bittering) hops, Irish moss and boil for 60 minutes. Add Fuggle aroma hops for the last 3 minutes of the boil.

When done boiling, add wort to 2 gallons (7.6 L) cool water in a sanitary fermenter, and top off with cool water to 5 gallons (19 L). Cool wort to 80 ºF (27 ºC), aerate the beer and pitch your yeast. Allow the beer to cool over the next few hours to 65–67 ºF (18–19 ºC), and hold at these temperatures until the yeast has fermented completely. Bottle your beer, age for 2–3 weeks and enjoy!

All-grain option:
This is a single infusion mash. Replace the light syrup and dry malt extract with 12 lbs. (5.4 kg) US pale 2-row malt. This will give an OG of 1.062, assuming an extract efficiency of 65%. Mash your grains at 155 ºF (68 ºC) for 60 minutes. Collect enough wort to boil for 90 minutes and have a 5.25-gallon (20-L) yield. The rest of the recipe follows the extract instructions given above.

Jens P. Maudal, Head Brewer at Haandbryggeriet in Drammen, Norway, says, "The recipe is our recreation of a traditional farm ale that was every farm’s regular drinking ale, and a stronger version was normally brewed for the Christmas holiday season."

Ingredients
8 lbs. 3 oz. (3.7 kg) Weyermann smoked malt
2 lbs. (0.91 kg) Munich malt
19 oz. (0.55 kg) Weyermann CaraAmber® malt
18 oz. (0.51 kg) British amber malt
11 oz. (0.31 kg) British pale malt
0.3 oz. (8.5 g) Northern Brewer hops (mash hop)
1.8 AAU Northern Brewer hops (60 min.) (0.2 oz./6 g at 8.5% alpha acids)
5.9 AAU Centennial hops (20 min.) (0.6 oz./17 g at 9.75% alpha acids)
5.6 AAU Cluster hops (0 min.) (0.8 oz./22 g at 7% alpha acids)
2 branches of fresh Juniper (with green berries)
Wyeast 3638 (Bavarian Wheat), White Labs WLP315 (Bavaria Weizen Yeast) or other wheat/wit yeast (2 qt./2 L yeast starter)
3/4 cup (150 g) dextrose (if priming)

Step by Step
Mash the grains as well as the juniper branches and mash hops at 151 °F (66 °C) for 60 minutes. Mash out, vorlauf, and then sparge at 170 °F (77 °C) to collect enough wort to result in 5 gallons (19 L) after a 90-minute boil. Boil wort for 90 minutes, adding hops at times indicated. Cool, aerate, and pitch yeast. Ferment at 70 °F (21 °C). After fermentation is complete, bottle or keg as usual.

Partial mash option:
Substitute the smoked malt and Munich malt in the all-grain recipe with 5 lb. 14 oz. (2.66 kg) Weyermann smoked malt extract and 1 lb. 6 oz. (0.62 kg) liquid Munich malt extract. Place the crushed malts, juniper branches, and mash hops in with steeping grains and steep at 151 °F (66 °C) in 3.75 qts. (3.6 L) of water for 45 minutes. Rinse the grain bag with 2 qts. (2 L) of 170 °F (77 °C) water. Combine "grain tea" and malt extracts along with enough water to top up to 6 gallons (23 L) and boil for 60 minutes. Follow the remaining portion of the all-grain recipe.

BYO 10th Anniversary Imperial American Stout
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.103 FG = 1.026
IBU = 60 SRM = 69 ABV = 10%

Ingredients
13 lbs. 2 oz. (6.0 kg) 2-row pale malt
2.75 lbs. (1.25 kg) Munich malt (10 °L)
5.0 lbs. (2.3 kg) flaked barley
2.0 oz. (57 g) biscuit malt
5.0 oz. (142 g) crystal malt (40 °L)
3.0 oz. (85 g) crystal malt (60 °L)
2.0 oz. (57 g) crystal malt (90 °L)
4.0 oz. (113 g) chocolate malt
12.0 oz. (340 g) roasted barley (500 °L)
2.0 oz. (57 g) black patent malt
25 AAU Centennial hops (10 additions) (2.5 oz./71 g of 10% alpha acids)
1/4 tsp yeast nutrients
1 tsp Irish moss
Wyeast 1056 (American Ale) or White Labs WLP001 (California Ale) yeast (4 qt./4 L yeast starter)
0.75 cups corn sugar (for priming)

Step by Step
To develop a highly-fermentable wort, follow this step-mash procedure. Heat 7.25 gallons (27 L) of water to 142 °F (61 °C) and stir the grains into this water (in your kettle). Adjust temperature, if needed, to 131 °F (55 °C) and rest for 15 minutes. Heat mash to 140 °F (60 °C) and hold for 15 minutes. (Stir nearly constantly when heating mash. Raise temperature at rate of about 2 °F (1 °C) per minute.)

Heat again to 149 °F (65 °C) and hold for 45 minutes. Heat to 162 °F (72 °C) and hold for 5 minutes, then heat to 167 °F (75 °C) and transfer mash to lauter tun. Recirculate for 15–20 minutes, then begin running off wort. Heat about 7 gallons (26 L) of sparge water to 170 °F (77 °C). (Use180–190 °F/82–88 °C sparge water if grain bed temperature drops below 165 °F/74 °C.) Collect 11.5 gallons (44 L) of wort and boil for about 5 hours to reduce volume to about 5.33 gallons (20 L) at the end of the boil.

Divide hops into ten 0.25 oz. (7.1 g) charges and add one charge with 90, 80, 70, 60, 50, 40, 30, 20 and 10 minutes left in the boil. Add the final hop addition at the end of the boil. Add Irish moss and yeast nutrients with 15 minutes left in boil.

Cool wort, let hops and trub settle and transfer clear wort to fermenter. Aerate wort (preferably with a 2-minute shot of oxygen) and pitch yeast sediment from starter. Ferment at 68 °F (20 °C) until fermentation is complete (about 2–3 weeks). Rack to secondary and let condition for about 2 months — at around 40 °F (4.4 °C), if possible. Bottle with corn sugar or force carbonate in keg.

25 AAU Centennial hops (10 additions) (2.5 oz./71 g of 10% alpha acids)
1/4 tsp yeast nutrients
1 tsp Irish moss
Wyeast 1056 (American Ale) or White Labs WLP001 (California Ale) yeast (4 qt./4 L yeast starter)
0.75 cups corn sugar (for priming)

Step by Step
For best results, you will need a brewpot big enough to boil 4 gallons (15 L) of wort and a grain bag big enough to hold 4.5 lbs. (2.0 kg) of grain. In your brewpot, bring 1.75 gallons (6.6 L) of water to 163 °F (73 °C). Put crushed grains in grain bag and submerge bag in the brewpot water; the temperature should drop to about 152 °F (67 °C). Hold at around this temperature for 45 minutes. (When temperature drops below 150 °F (66 °C), heat to 155 °F (68 °C).)

Place grain bag in a colander over brewpot and rinse grains with 1 gallon (3.8 L) of water at 170 °F (77 °C). Discard grains, add water - about 0.5 gallon (~2 L) - to make 4 gallons (15 L) and heat "Grain tea" to a boil.

Shut off heat and stir in dried malt extract. Resume heating and boil for 90 minutes, add 0.25 oz. (7.1 g) of hops every 10 minutes with the final hop addition coming at the end of the boil. Add liquid malt extract, Irish moss and yeast nutrients with 15 minutes left in boil. (Shut off heat when you stir in the extract.) Cool wort, let hops and trub settle and transfer clear wort to fermenter.

Add water to make 5 gallons (19 L), aerate wort and pitch yeast sediment from starter. Ferment at 68 °F (20 °C) until fermentation is complete (about 2-3 weeks). Rack to secondary and let condition for about 2 months - at around 40 °F (4.4 °C), if possible. Bottle with corn sugar. You may want to add 1 tsp. of dried yeast (Safale US-05, for example) at bottling to facilitate carbonation.

Ingredients
16.0 lbs. (7.3 kg) Belgian Pils malt
2.0 lbs. (0.91 kg) Belgian Caravienne malt
2.0 lbs. (0.91 kg) Carapils®/dextrine malt
2.0 lbs. (0.91 kg) flaked oats
8 AAU Czech Saaz hops (first wort hop) (2.0 oz./57 g at 4.0% alpha acids)
8 AAU Czech Saaz hops (45 min.) (2.0 oz./57 g at 4.0% alpha acids)
1.0 oz. (28 g) whole coriander (15 min.)
1.0 tsp. (28 g) whole cardamom (15 min.)
1.0 tsp. Irish moss (15 min.)
White Labs WLP565 (Belgian Saison I) yeast (2-liter starter)
13.0 oz. corn sugar (if priming)

Step by step
Make a two-liter yeast starter, with an original gravity of 1.048, a day or two before brewing. Dough-in the mash at 149 °F (65 °C). Rest for 90 minutes. Raise the mash temperature to 168 °F (76 °C) and mash-out for 30 minutes. Take the next 45 minutes to sparge with enough 168 °F (76 °C) water to collect 12 gallons (45 L) of wort. Go ahead and be lazy like me and add the first hop addition to the kettle now. Boil for 60 minutes. Add second hop addition 15 minutes into the boil.

At 45 minutes into the boil, add Irish moss and spice (coriander and cardamom — tie it in cheesecloth and crush it lightly with a rolling pin). Chill and transfer to your fermenter and pitch the whole yeast starter. Primary fermentation should take about 10–14 days, then rack it to secondary for an additional 7–14 days. Don't be shy about allowing the fermentation temperature to get up into the 70s °F (low 20 °C). Prime with 13 ounces (370 g) of corn sugar, bottle. Age for 2-4 weeks before sampling the beer.

1 lb. (0.45 kg) Vienna malt
0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) dark Munich malt (20° L)
0.25 lb. (113 g) wheat malt
1 lb. (0.45 kg) lager malt
5 lbs. (2.3 kg) unhopped amber liquid malt extract
7.2 AAU Perle hop pellets (60 min.) (1 oz./28 g at 7.2% alpha acids)
2 AAU Hallertauer hop pellets (20 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 4% alpha acids)
1.75 AAU Spalt pellets (20 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 3.5% alpha acids)
2 oz. (57 g) coarsely cracked (not ground) light-roast coffee beans
1 cinnamon stick
Saflager S-23 or Lallemand Diamond lager or Wyeast 2308 (Munich Lager) yeast
3/4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Heat 1.5 gals. (5.7 L) of water to 132 °F (56 °C), crack and mix in malts and malted wheat. The mash should settle at 121 °F (50 °C). Hold 30 minutes, then remove 3 qts. (2.9 L) of the mash and boil it 15 minutes. Stir heated mash back into the mash tun. This should raise the whole mash to 137 °F (58 °C) or so. Hold another 30 minutes, then remove 3 qts. (2.9 L) again and bring to a boil. Boil this 15 minutes, add it back to the mash tun, raising the whole to about 152 °F (67 °C). Hold here for 40 minutes, then lauter and sparge with 2 gals. (7.6 L) of 168 °F (76 °C) water. To this runoff (about 3 gals./11 L) add the liquid malt extract and bring to a boil. Add Perle hop pellets, boil 40 minutes. Add Hallertauer and Spalt pellets, boil 20 minutes.

Remove from heat and chill the wort down to 180 °F (82 °C) add coffee beans and cinnamon stick. Steep at least 15 minutes, then chill fully and top off to 5.25 gals. (20 L) with water. At 75 °F (24 °C) pitch dry lager yeast or a liquid culture. Seal and ferment for one day at 65 °F (18 °C), then place in a cooler set between 50 to 55 °F (10 to 13 °C) for a week. Rack to secondary and, if possible, place in a cold place (40 °F/4 °C or below) for three more weeks. (Otherwise, maintain at 50 °F/10 °C for two to thee weeks.) Prime with corn sugar and bottle.

Notes:
Experienced decoction mashers will probably laugh at this primitive partial-decoction-mash recipe. I know it is not quite a usual triple decoction, but it seems to work for this recipe. If you have a better all-grain Vienna recipe, go with it. If you are going to mash at all for this recipe, I strongly encourage you to try it as a decoction, if only for the lovely color you can produce by boiling the mash.

Extract brewers who can't even partial mash, don't worry; an additional pound of amber dry malt extract will give you enough body and fermentables to make this work. Briess Goldpils Vienna liquid malt extract mixed with the amber malt extract maybe a good substitute as well.

Dark-roasted coffee should be avoided, because it will darken the beer. You want to give a hint of coffee and cinnamon, not make them the dominant flavors, so don't steep them in the cooling wort too long, but just long enough to give some brownish color and coffee-cinnamon aroma.

(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.057  FG = 1.010
IBU = 62  SRM = 5  ABV = 6.2%

Ingredients
7.25 lbs. (3.3 kg) 2-row pale malt
3.5 lbs. (1.6 kg) white wheat malt
1 lb. (0.45 kg) Weyermann Carahell® malt
4.3 AAU Northern Brewer hops (60 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 8.5% alpha acids)
28 AAU Columbus hops (0 min.) (2 oz./57 g at 14% alpha acids)
10 AAU Centennial hops (0 min.) (1 oz./28 g at 10% alpha acids)
2 oz. (57 g) Centennial hops (dry hop)
2 oz. (57 g) Citra® hops (dry hop)
1⁄2 tsp. yeast nutrient (15 min.)
1 tsp. Irish moss (15 min.)
White Labs WLP648 (Brettanomyces bruxellensis Trois Vrai) yeast
2⁄3 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Mill the grains and dough-in with 15 qts. (14 L) water, for a mash ratio of about 1.25 quarts per pound of grain (2.6 L/kg). Target a mash temperature of 155 °F (68 °C) and hold for 60 minutes. Sparge with 170 °F (77 °C) water. Collect approximately 6.3 gallons (23.8 L) of wort runoff and bring to boil. Add bittering hops and boil for 60 minutes. Turn off heat, then add the 0-minute hop additions and let steep for half an hour before you begin cooling the wort. This "whirlpool" hop addition can be calculated as somewhere between a 10–5 minute addition for alpha acid utilization.

Cool the wort to 72 °F (22 °C), then top off with cold, filtered water to reach 5 gallons (19 L). Pitch a 2 qt. (2 L) yeast starter and ferment at 68–72 °F (20–22 °C). Fermentation should take two to three weeks, but keep an eye on your gravity. Following fermentation, dry hop for one week, then bottle or keg.

Step by Step
Steep the crushed grain in 2 gallons (7.6 L) of water as it warms until a temperature of about 150 °F (65.5 °C) is reached, or approximately 20 minutes. Remove grains from the wort and rinse with 4 quarts (3.8 L) of hot water. Add the liquid to reach a total of 3 gallons (11.3 L) and bring to boil. Turn off heat, add malt extract, and stir until completely dissolved. Return to heat and add 60 minute hop addition, then continue boil for 60 minutes. At flameout, add final hop additions and turn off heat. Let hops steep (whirlpool) for 30 minutes before cooling. This "whirlpool" hop addition can be calculated as somewhere between a 10–5 minute addition for alpha acid utilization.

1 tsp. Irish moss (10 min.)
Wyeast 2112 (California Lager or White Labs WLP0810 (San Francisco Lager) yeast
1 cup dry malt extract (for priming)

Step by Step
Start at 130 °F (54 °C) for a 30-minute rest and increase the mash temperature, using a combination of hot-water infusion and direct heat, to 152 °F (67 °C) for a 60-minute saccharification rest, then to 168 °F (76 °C) for the mash-out.

Recirculate your wort until it runs clear (about 15 minutes) and sparge with 170 °F (77 °C) water until you reach a kettle gravity of about 1.047 (11.8 °P) to account for evaporation losses during the boil. Boil for 75 minutes.

Add the bittering hops after 15 minutes and the aroma hops and Irish moss as indicated in the ingredients section. After shutdown, let the brew rest for about 15 minutes.

Then siphon the wort off the trub and heat exchange it to your preferred pitching temperature, between 58 °F (14 °C) and 72 °F (22 °C). Ferment for 10 days and rack.

Allow an additional week for secondary fermentation. Rack again and prime for packaging. Let the brew condition and mellow in bottles or in a keg for another two to three weeks.

Anchor Brewing Company has always been very generous to homebrewers. This recipe makes a beer similar in flavor to Anchor Steam, but a bit bigger in mouthfeel, hops and malt flavors. If you want a beer a bit drier and more like Anchor Steam, eliminate the Munich, Victory and pale chocolate malts.

Ingredients
9 lb. (4.1 kg) Great Western domestic two-row malt (or similar)
17.6 oz. (500 g) Durst Munich malt (or similar)
14.1 oz. (400 g) Great Western crystal malt (40 °L) (or similar)
7 oz. (200 g) Briess Victory® malt (28 °L) (or similar)
1.75 oz. (50 g) Crisp pale chocolate malt (200 °L) (or similar)
5 AAU Northern Brewer hops (60 min.) (0.77 oz./22 g of 6.5% alpha acids)

White Labs WLP810 (San Francisco Lager) or Wyeast 2112 (California Lager) or Mangrove Jack's M54 (California Lager) yeast

Step by Step
Mill the grains and dough-in targeting a mash of around 1.5 quarts of water to 1 pound of grain (a liquor-to-grist ratio of about 3:1 by weight) and a temperature of 150 °F (66 °C). Hold the mash at 150 °F (66 °C) until enzymatic conversion is complete. Infuse the mash with near boiling water while stirring or with a recirculating mash system raise the temperature to mash out at 168 °F (76 °C). Sparge slowly with 170 °F (77 °C) water, collecting wort until the pre-boil kettle volume is around 5.9 gallons (22.3 L) and the gravity is 1.046 (11.4 °P).

The total wort boil time is 60 minutes. Add the bittering hops as soon as the wort starts boiling. Add the second hop addition and Irish moss or other finings with 15 minutes left. The last hop addition goes in 1 minute before the end of the boil. Chill the wort rapidly to 62 °F (17 °C), let the break material settle, rack to the fermenter, pitch the yeast and aerate thoroughly. The proper pitch rate is 2.5 packages of liquid yeast or 1 package of liquid yeast in a 3-liter starter.

Ferment at 62 °F (17 °C) until the beer attenuates fully. With healthy yeast, fermentation should be complete within a week, but do not rush it. Rack to a keg and force carbonate or rack to a bottling bucket, add priming sugar, and bottle. Target a carbonation level of 2.5 to 3 volumes.

Step by Step
Most Munich liquid malt extract (LME) is sold as a blend of Munich and Pilsner or two-row malts in different percentages. I specify 100% Munich LME in my recipe so you will know how much of your blend to use for your brew. When using a blend, replace the Munich extract in the recipe and enough of the two-row extract to match the percentage of the blend. If you want to use 100% Munich extract, the only current supplier I am aware of is Weyermann. If you cannot get fresh liquid malt extract, it is better to use an appropriate amount of dried malt extract (DME) instead.

Mill or coarsely crack the specialty malt and place loosely in a grain bag. Avoid packing the grains too tightly in the bag, using more bags if needed. Steep the bag in about 1 gallon (~4 liters) of water at roughly 170 °F (77 °C) for about 30 minutes. Lift the grain bag out of the steeping liquid and rinse with warm water. Allow the bags to drip into the kettle for 15 minutes while you add the malt extract. Do not squeeze the bags. Add enough water to the steeping liquor and malt extract to make a pre-boil volume of 5.9 gallons (22.3 L) and a gravity of 1.046 (11.4 °P). Stir thoroughly and bring to a boil.

The total wort boil time is 60 minutes. Add the bittering hops as soon as the wort starts boiling. Add the second hop addition and Irish moss or other finings with 15 minutes left. The last hop addition goes in 1 minute before the end of the boil. Chill the wort rapidly to 62 °F (17 °C), let the break material settle, rack to the fermenter, pitch the yeast and aerate thoroughly.

0.75 cups corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Place the crushed grains into two strainer bags. If using leaf hops, place the boiling and finishing hops in separate bags. Pellet hops need not be placed in bags, as they will not be strained out later. Pour 2.5 gallons (9.5 L) of water into the kettle. Add the grain bags to your kettle and bring the water almost to a boil. Remove the kettle from heat and let it sit for 10 minutes.

Carefully remove the grain bags and place them into a strainer over the kettle. Rinse the grain bags with one quart of hot water into the kettle and dispose of the spent grains. Add the malt extract to the kettle and stir until it is completely dissolved. Place the kettle back on the burner and bring it to a boil.

Once a vigorous boil has been achieved, add the boiling hops. Time the boil for one hour from this point. After 55 minutes of boiling, add the finishing hops. Let the boil continue for five minutes then remove the kettle from heat. Cover the kettle and let it cool for 20 minutes before continuing. If using leaf hops, carefully remove the hop bags from the kettle and place them in a strainer over the fermenter. Pour 2.5 gallons (9.5 L) of very cold water into the fermenter (pour this over any leaf hops to rinse them.) Add the contents of the kettle to the cold water in the fermenter. Top up the fermenter to 1 inch (2.5 cm) over the 5 gallon (19 L) mark with cold water.

All-grain Option:
Your grain bill is 11.5 lbs. (5.2 kg) US two-row malt and 0.75 lbs. (0.34 kg) English crystal malt (70–80 °L).

3/4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Mash in at 152 °F (67 °C) for 40 minutes. Sparge to collect ~6.5 gallons (25 L) in your kettle to achieve 5.5 gallons (21 L) at knockout. Boil for a grand total of 75 minutes. Just after knockout, toss in the knockout hops and begin whirlpool. You can either run your pump for 10 minutes or stir for a minute and then let spin down and settle. After 30 minutes have gone past after knockout, cool the wort down to 65 °F (18 °C) and pitch a healthy dose of yeast into fermenter. After final gravity has been achieved, add clarifying agent such as polyclar. Allow three days for clarifying agent to settle, then add first set of dry hops to primary fermenter. After 7 days, rack beer off dry hops and yeast cake either into a keg or bottle. Try your best to keep oxygen at bay during the racking or bottling process.

Old Style Light has been around for over 100 years, featuring a crisp freshness of a classic American lager. Still a mainstay in the Midwest and at Chicago Cubs games.

Ingredients
5 lbs. 10 oz. (2.6 kg) 6-row pale malt
1.5 lbs. (0.68 kg) rice syrup solids
2.7 AAU Cluster hops (60 min.) (0.38 oz./11 g of 7.0% alpha acids)
|1.3 AAU Mt. Hood hops (25 min.) (0.25 oz./7.1 g at 5% alpha acids)
1.8 AAU Sterling hops (0 min.) (0.25 oz./7.1 g at 7.4% alpha acids)
White Labs WLP840 (American Lager) or Wyeast 2272 (North American Lager) yeast
3/4 cup (150 g) dextrose (if priming)

Step by Step
Mash the grains 60 minutes at 149 °F (65 °C). Mash out, vorlauf, and then sparge at 170 °F (77 °C) to collect 6.5 gallons (25 L) of wort. Boiling 75 minutes, adding hops as indicated. After the boil, collect wort for Kräusening. Use the following formula to calculate how much kräusen wort to set aside Vk (qts.) = 12 * Vw (gallons)/D (sgp). Where Vk = volume of wort to set aside for kräusening, Vw = volume of post-boil wort, and D = wort density in specific gravity points. Add approximately one pint (500 mL) of wort to the calculated volume. This will allow for variations in the degree to which it has fermented before being added to the beer. Freeze and store the retained wort in a sealed, clean container. At this opint, cool, aerate, and pitch yeast in the remainder of the wort and ferment at 53 °F (12 °C). Two days before bottling or kegging, take out the Kräusening wort and add a little water to account for the boiling losses, and then boil for 10 minutes to sanitize. Chill the wort after boiling and pour into a sanitized vessel with enough volume to contain the saved wort plus an additional 10–15 percent. Pitch several grams (approximately 0.1 oz.) of dry, neutral yeast into the sanitized vessel. Stir or agitate well. Cover the vessel loosely with a sanitized lid or aluminum foil and allow it to ferment at room temperature. After two days (48 hours), the wort should be actively fermenting (at high kräusen), yet enough sugars should remain to provide carbonation. Add the fermenting kräusen wort in the same manner you would use priming sugar solution for the rest of the beer that is ready for bottling or kegging. You should leave behind most of the trub (sediment) that has settled to the bottom of the vessel used to ferment the kräusen wort. Carbonation should be completed in approximately 7–10 days at room temperature.

Extract only option:
Reduce the rice syrup solids in the all-grain recipe to 1 lb. (0.45 kg) and substitute the 6-row pale malt with 4.25 lbs. (1.93 kg) American lager liquid malt extract. Bring 5.5 gallons (21 L) of water to a boil and add extracts. Boil for 60 minutes. Follow the remaining portion of the all-grain recipe.

Candy cap mushrooms impart a distinct flavor and aroma of maple syrup, but unlike syrup those qualities are not lost in fermentation. A little goes a long way with these mushrooms.

Ingredients
13 lbs. (5.9 kg) 2-row malt
1 lb. (0.45 kg) brown malt
1 lb. (0.45 kg) flaked oats
1 lb. (0.45 kg) Carafa® III malt
1 lb. (0.45 kg) dextrose sugar (10 min.)
12.75 AAU Brewers Gold hops (60 min.) (1.5 oz./42 g at 8.5% alpha acids)
12.75 AAU Brewers Gold hops (10 min.) (1.5 oz./42 g at 8.5% alpha acids)
0.07–0.14 oz. (2–4 g) dried candy cap mushrooms (secondary)
Wyeast 1056 (American Ale), White Labs WLP001 (California Ale), or SafAle US-05 yeast
2⁄3 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by step
This is a single step infusion mash. Heat 4 gallons (15 L) of strike water to 168 °F (76 °C). Stir in the grains, ensuring no dough balls are left. Mash should stabilize at 154 °F (68 °C). Hold at this temperature for 60 minutes then begin your lautering process. Sparge with enough water to collect 7 gallons (26.5 L) of wort in your kettle. Boil for 90 minutes adding hops and corn sugar at the times indicated.

After the boil is complete, chill the wort down to fermentation temperature and pitch the yeast. Be sure to aerate the wort properly and pitch enough yeast if using a liquid strain. Use two sachets if using a dry yeast strain; aeration is not needed. Ferment at 69–72 °F (20–22 °C) for two weeks.

The dried candy cap mushrooms are added during secondary a week before packaging. Two grams will impart a more subtle hint of maple, while 4 grams should impart a pronounced, lingering maple character. It’s recommended to start at the low end of the addition rate the first time brewing this recipe (you can always make a steeped mushroom tea to add after fermentation if you desire more character from the mushrooms).

After a week, rack off the mushrooms and bottle or keg as usual.

1 lb. (0.45 kg) Carafa® III malt
0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) Carafoam®
0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) crystal malt (60 °L)
1 lb. (0.45 kg) dextrose sugar (10 min.)
12.75 AAU Brewers Gold hops (60 min.) (1.5 oz./42 g at 8.5% alpha acids)
12.75 AAU Brewers Gold hops (10 min.) (1.5 oz./42 g at 8.5% alpha acids)
0.07–0.14 oz. (2–4 g) dried candy cap mushrooms (secondary)
Wyeast 1056 (American Ale), White Labs WLP001 (California Ale), or SafAle US-05 yeast
2⁄3 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by step
Begin by heating 5 gallons (19 L) of water in your kettle. Place crushed grain in a muslin bag and submerge in the water. Allow the grains to steep as the water heats up to 168 °C (76 °C). Remove grains allowing liquid to drip back in the kettle. Remove kettle from heat and stir in the dried malt extract. Once the extract is fully dissolved, turn heat back on and bring wort to a boil. Boil for a total of 60 minutes adding hops and sugar at the times indicated.

After the boil is complete, chill the wort to fermentation temperature. Transfer to a fermenter and top off to 5 gallons (19 L). Pitch the yeast. Be sure to aerate the wort properly and pitch enough yeast if using a liquid strain. Use two sachets if using a dry yeast strain; aeration is not needed. Ferment at 69–72 °F (20–22 °C) for two weeks.

The dried candy cap mushrooms are added during secondary a week before packaging. Two grams will impart a more subtle hint of maple, while 4 grams should impart a pronounced, lingering maple character (you can always make a mushroom tea to add after fermentation if you desire more character from the mushrooms). After a week, rack off the mushrooms and bottle or keg as usual.

White Labs WLP007 (Dry English Ale) or Wyeast 1275 (Thames Valley) yeast
3/4 cup (150 g) corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Mill the grains with the exception of the flaked barley. Dough in (including the unmilled flaked barley) using 5 gallons (19 L) of water and a target mash holding temperature of 154 °F (68 °C). Hold the mash temperature for approximately 60 minutes or until the conversion is complete. Raise the temperature of the mash to 168 °F (76 °C) and begin sparging with 170 °F (77 °C) water until you collect 6.5 gallons (25 L) of wort in the kettle.

Boil for 90 minutes adding hops and finings as indicated. Cool the wort to 70 °F (21 °C), transfer to your fermentation vessel and aerate the wort adequately. Add the contents of your yeast starter to the chilled wort. Ferment around 70 °F (21 °C) until the final gravity is reached, which should be in 5 to 7 days. Rack to a secondary vessel and allow the beer to mature another 5 to 7 days around the same temperature. Your beer is now ready to rack into a keg or bottles along with the priming sugar.

Extract with grains version: 
Replace pale malt, Munich malt, wheat malt, and flaked barley with 6.6 lbs. (3 kg) light liquid malt extract, 1 lb. (0.45 kg) Munich dried malt extract and 1 lb. (0.45 kg) wheat dried malt extract. 

Mill the specialty grains and place the milled grains in a grain bag. Steep them in 5 gallons (19 L) of 154 °F (68 °C) water for 30 minutes. Rinse the grain bag with about 2 qts. (1.9 L) of water and allow it to drip into the kettle for about 15 minutes. 

Add enough water for a pre-boil volume of 6.5 gallons (25 L). Stir in all three malt extracts and begin the boil. The total wort boiling time for this recipe is 60 minutes adding hops and finings as indicated. Cool the wort to 70 °F (21 °C), transfer to your fermentation vessel and aerate the wort adequately. Add the contents of your yeast starter to the chilled wort. Ferment around 70 °F (21 °C) until the final gravity is reached, which should be in 5 to 7 days. Rack to a secondary vessel and allow the beer to mature another 5 to 7 days around the same temperature. Your beer is now ready to rack into a keg or bottles along with the priming sugar.

Starr Hill Brewery: Jomo clone
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.052 FG = 1.011
IBU = 24 SRM = 11 ABV = 5.4%

This year-round offering from Starr Hill is fermented with Southern German lager yeast, its crisp, clean taste, and noticeable hop aroma are effectively balanced with a slight malty sweetness. Jomo has won multiple awards, including two gold medals (2004, 2011) at the Great American Beer Festival.

Ingredients
7.25 lbs. (3.3 kg) Pilsner malt
1.5 lbs. (0.68 kg) crystal malt (20 °L)
1 lb. (0.45 kg) dark Munich malt (9 °L)
1 lb. (0.45 kg) Belgian aromatic malt
6.25 AAU Hallertau Tradition hops (60 min.) (1.25 oz./35 g at 5% alpha acids)
Wyeast 2308 (Munich Lager) or White Labs WLP838 (Southern German Lager) yeast
3/4 cup (150 g) dextrose (if priming)

Step by Step
Mill the grains and mix with 3.5 gallons (13.2 L) of 161 °F (72 °C) strike water to reach a mash temperature of 149 °F (65 °C). Hold this temperature for 60 minutes before starting the lautering process. Vorlauf until your runnings are clear. Sparge the grains with 4 gallons (15.1 L) of sparge water and top up as necessary to obtain 6 gallons (23 L) of wort. Boil for 60 minutes, adding hops according to the ingredients list. Chill to 50 °F (10 °C), aerate, and pitch yeast. Ferment at 50 °F (10 °C) for 4 days, or until the beer reaches 1.024 SG. At that time, increase the temperature to 58 °F (14 °C) for an additional seven days. Once the beer reaches final gravity, bottle or keg and carbonate to approximately 2.5 volumes. Cold conditioning at near-freezing temperatures can be done prior to or after packaging, and should last for at least six weeks.

Partial mash option:
Substitute the Pilsner malt in the all-grain recipe with 5 lbs. (2.3 kg) Pilsen liquid malt extract. Place crushed grains in a large grain bag. Bring 1 gallon (4 L) of water to approximately 162 °F (72 °C) to reach a mash temperature of 149 °F (65 °C). Hold this temperature for 60 minutes. Remove grain bag, then wash the grains with 1-gallon (4-L) hot water. Let the grains drain fully. Top off to 6 gallons (23 L) of water, then add the liquid malt extract and stir until completely dissolved. Bring the wort to a boil for 60 minutes Follow the remaining portion of the all-grain recipe.

Tips for Success:
Starr Hill Brewmaster Robbie O’Cain points to three key elements to brewing their Vienna lager: Temperature, time, and water. First, mash on the low end of the temperature spectrum (149 °F/65 °C) to improve attenuation and produce a very fermentable wort with few long-chain sugars.

Second, temperature control is very important for fermenting lagers, as well as for the lagering phase. If you like brewing lagers and haven’t already done so, converting an old dorm or full-size refrigerator, or chest freezer, into a fermentation chamber (utilizing a temperature controller) is a great project (there are many design ideas for building one of these on the Internet). Sometimes lager strains can produce sulfur compounds during fermentation that can give off weird odors. If you take your time in the conditioning phase, these should disappear. Also, take your time letting this beer lager at cold temperatures. "This beer is about patience," Robbie says.

And third, Starr Hill brews with very soft water, so if your water has a solid mineral base you might consider diluting your mash or boil water with a distilled water (or at least use something bottled that’s softer than yours).

(5 gallons/19 L extract with grains)
OG = 1.063 FG = 1.014
IBU = 28 SRM = 12 ABV = 6.4%

Ingredients
6.6 lbs. (3.0 kg) Coopers unhopped light malt extract
0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) amber dried malt extract
1.5 lb. (0.68 kg) Munich malt
0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) crystal malt (20 ºL)
0.25 lb. (113 g) flaked barley
2 oz. (57g) chocolate malt
1/2 tsp. yeast nutrient (15 min.)
3.9 AAU Crystal hop pellets (60 min.) (0.3 oz./8.5 g of 13.0% alpha acid)
1.9 AAU Cascade hop pellets (60 min.) (0.3 oz /8.5 g of 5.7% alpha acid)
2.8 AAU Cascade hop pellets (30 min.) (0.5 oz./14g of 5.7% alpha acid)
1.2 AAU Willamette hop pellets (5 min.) (0.25 oz./7g of 4.8% alpha acid)
White Labs WLP002 (English Ale) or Wyeast 1098 (British Ale) or Safale S-04 yeast
0.75 cup (150 g) of corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Steep the crushed grain in 3 gallons (11.4 L) of water at 155 ºF (68 ºC) for 30 minutes. Remove grains from the wort, add the liquid extract and bring to a boil. Add the first additions of Crystal and Cascade hops and boil for 60 minutes. During the boil, use this time to thoroughly sanitize a fermenter. Add the second addition of Cascade hops and boil for 30 minutes. Add the yeast nutrient for the last 15 minutes. Add the last addition of Willamette hops for the final 5 minutes of the boil. Now add the wort to 2 gallons (7.6 L) of cold water in the sanitized fermenter and top off with cold water up to 5 gallons (19 L).
Cool the wort to 75 ºF (24 ºC). Pitch your yeast and aerate the wort heavily. Allow the beer to cool to 68 ºF (20 ºC). Hold at that temperature until fermentation is complete. Transfer to a carboy, avoiding any splashing to prevent aerating the beer. Condition for 1 week and then bottle or keg. Allow to carbonate for 2 weeks!

All-grain option: This is a single step infusion mash. Replace the malt syrup and dried malt extract with 9 lbs. (4.1 kg) 2 row pale malt, 2.25 lbs. (1 kg) Munich, 1.25 lbs. (0.56 kg) crystal 20 ºL, 0.25 lbs. (113 g) flaked barley, and 3 oz. (85 g) chocolate malt. Mix the crushed grain with 4 gallons (15.2 L) of 170 °F (77 °C) water to stabilize at 155 ºF (68 ºC) for 60 minutes. Sparge slowly with 175 ºF (79 ºC) water. Collect approximately 6 gallons (23 L) of wort runoff to boil for 60 minutes. Reduce the first addition (60-minute) of Crystal and Cascade hops to 3.25 AAU (0.25 oz./7 g) and 1.4 AAU (0.25 oz./7 g) respectively due to the higher utilization factor for a full wort boil. The remainder of this recipe is the same as the extract recipe.

Castle Danger Brewery's Nordic Sahti clone
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.053 FG = 1.011
IBU = 26 SRM = 7 ABV = 5.5%

Ingredients
8 lbs. (3.6 kg) Pilsen malt
1.25 lbs. (567 g) Briess caramel malt (10 °L)
1 lb. (454 g) flaked rye
0.75 lb. (340 g) honey malt
1.5 oz. (43 g) dried juniper berries, crushed (20 min.)
5 AAU Saaz hops (60 min.) (2 oz./57 g at 2.5% alpha acids)
7.2 AAU Hallertau hops (10 min.) (1.5 oz./43 g at 4.8% alpha acids)
1 oz. (28 g) Fuggle hops (0 min.)
Wyeast 2112 (California Lager), White Labs WLP810 (San Francisco Lager), or Mangrove Jack’s M54 (California Lager) yeast
¾ cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Mill your malts but leave rye flakes whole. Strike-in with approximately 3.5 gallons (13.25 L) of water to achieve a single infusion mash rest at 152 °F (67 °C). A softer water profile works well, but adjust your water as needed and aim at mash pH around 5.3 for best results. It’s OK to mash a little thinner than this if desired, especially with the rye flakes and rice hulls if you choose to use them. Mash for 60 minutes or until converted. Vorlauf until clear and then begin transfer into brew kettle.

With kettle full, take a pre-boil gravity reading. Boil for 60 minutes. It’s OK to boil longer if you want more color and flavor development, if you prefer to concentrate your wort, or want to ensure elimination of potential DMS (dimethyl sulfide) from the Pilsner malt. Add bittering hops at the 60-minute mark. With 20 minutes left add crushed juniper berries. Keep them in a bag to make removal easier. Add remaining hops at 10 minutes and at flameout.

Chill wort to 62 °F (16 °C) and transfer to your sanitized fermenter. Oxygenate at a moderate rate if using liquid yeast strain, then pitch the yeast. Ferment at 62 °F (16 °C). Primary fermentation can take 5–12 days depending on several variables. The key is to be patient. The beer should finish around 1.010–1.011. Rack to secondary if desired or let sit for about one week after primary fermentation is complete then proceed to keg or bottle condition. Carbonate the beer to 2.6 volumes of CO2.

Castle Danger Brewery's Nordic Sahti clone
(5 gallons/19 L, partial mash)
OG = 1.053 FG = 1.011
IBU = 26 SRM = 7 ABV = 5.5%

Ingredients
3.75 lbs. (1.7 kg) Pilsen dried malt extract
1 lb. (454 g) Pilsner malt
1.25 lbs. (567 g) Briess caramel malt (10 °L)
1 lb. (454 g) flaked rye
0.75 lb. (340 g) honey malt
1.5 oz. (43 g) dried juniper berries, crushed (20 min.)
5 AAU Saaz hops (60 min.) (2 oz./57 g at 2.5% alpha acids)
7.2 AAU Hallertau hops (10 min.) (1.5 oz./43 g at 4.8% alpha acids)
1 oz. (28 g) Fuggle hops (0 min.)
Wyeast 2112 (California Lager), White Labs WLP810 (San Francisco Lager), or Mangrove Jack’s M54 (California Lager) yeast
¾ cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Flaked grains have no diastatic power, so they cannot self-convert, but they have fermentable sugars if converted. They need to be mashed with a base malt in order to be converted, so we will use 1 lb. (454 g) of Pilsner base malt to help convert the flaked rye and the honey malt. (The caramel malt is already pre-converted to sugar.) The rest of the base malt will come from dried malt extract.

Using about 2 gallons (7.57 L) of water, achieve a single infusion mash rest at 152 °F (67 °C). Insert the grains inside a mesh bag for easy removal later. Mash for 60 minutes or until converted. Remove the grain bag, allowing the liquid to drain out. Raise wort temperature to near boiling, then remove pot from heat and slowly stir in about half of your extract until thoroughly dissolved. Holding back about half of the extract allows your hop extraction to better replicate that of the all-grain version. Return to heat source and raise to boil. Boil for 60 minutes.

Add bittering hops at the beginning of the boil. With 20 minutes left add crushed juniper berries. Keep them in a hop bag to make removal easier. Add remaining hops at 10 minutes and at flameout. Add remaining extract with about five minutes remaining in the boil to properly dissolve the sugars and sanitize the extracts.

Pre-boil and chill about 3.5 gallons (9.5 L) of water separately so you can add that to the wort later. Best to do this before your brew to make life easier.

Follow the all-grain recipe’s step-by-step for remaining fermentation and packaging instructions.

Tips For Success:
If you are looking to brew a more historical version of the style, consider using a hefeweizen yeast strain that will provide the signature banana and clove character. If you want to replicate Castle Danger’s Nordic as closely as possible, then employ a California common yeast.

According to Brewmaster Bjorn Erickson, "The fun thing about this kind of brew is you can feel free to change things up without being untrue to the style. If you are feeling bold, try using more rye, or add some Weyermann Cararye® for more color and depth to the rye flavor. Your mileage will vary with the juniper berries, especially depending on how much you can crush them and what state they are in. ‘Dry hopping’ with juniper berries can add more of the piney/menthol notes. An ounce or two (30–60 g) of lemon zest or caraway seeds can also punch up the aroma." Don’t be afraid to play around with this one!

Virtual OG = 1.210 FG = 1.044
IBU = ?? SRM = ?? ABV = 21%

Ingredients
31 lbs. (14 kg) Maris Otter pale ale malt
32 AAU Warrior hops (60 min) (2.0 oz. /57 g of 16% alpha acids)
18 AAU Amarillo hops (60 min) (2.0 oz./57 g of 9% alpha acids)
13 tablets Beano
White Labs WLP099 (Super High Gravity Ale) yeast

Step by Step
Make a 1-gallon (3.8-L) yeast starter with an original gravity of 1.066. Put wort in 6.5-gallon (25-L) carboy and pitch yeast.

Heat 9.7 gallons (37 L) of water to 157 °F (69 °C) and stir in crushed grains. You will need at least 14 gallons/56 quarts (53 L) of mash tun space to do this. Let mash rest for at least 90 minutes at 146 °F (63 °C) or until an iodine test indicates conversion is complete. (I mashed over-night). You are shooting for a very fermentable wort. Recirculate until the wort is clear and then begin the runoff. Sparge with 180 °F (82 °C) until grain bed temperature reaches 170 °F (77 °C), then sparge with 170 °F (77 °C) water. Collect 18 gallons (68 L) of wort and boil to reduce volume to 4.0 gallons (15 L). While boiling, attempt to minimize the amount of color pickup. Cool wort and transfer 1.0 gallon (3.8 L) of wort to your carboy. Aerate well. Can the remaining 3 gallons (11 L) of wort in 1 qt. (~1 L) canning jars. When the main fermentation slows, add more high gravity wort and aerate. Repeat. When all wort has fermented, add 8 tablets of Beano. Add 5 more Beano tablets when fermentation slows again. After beer conditions, keg and force carbonate.

Ingredients
1 lb. (0.45 kg) British medium crystal malt
8 oz. (227 g) torrified wheat
1 oz. (28 g) British black patent malt
7.5 lbs. (3.4 kg) Muntons extra-light dried malt extract
8 oz. (227 g) maltodextrin powder
9.2 AAUs Fuggles (60 min.) (2 oz./57 g at 4.6% alpha acids)
5 AAUs East Kent Goldings (15 min.) (1 oz./28 g of 5% alpha acida)
2.5 AAUs East Kent Goldings (1 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g of 5% alpha acids)
2.5 AAUs Styrian Goldings (1 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g of 5% alpha acid)
Wyeast 1968 (London ESB Ale) or White Labs WLP002 (English Ale) or Lallemand London ESB Ale yeast
1-1/4 cup Muntons extra-light dried malt extract (DME) for priming

Step by Step
Bring 1 gallon (3.8 L) of water to 160 °F (71 °C), add crushed grain and hold for 30 minutes at 150 °F (66 °C). Strain the grain into the brewpot and sparge with one gallon (3.8 L) of 168 °F (76 °C) water. Add the dried malt extract, maltodextrin and bittering hops. Bring the total volume in the brewpot to 4 gallons (15 L). Boil for 45 minutes, then add the second round of hops and Irish moss. Boil for 14 minutes, then add the final round of hops. Boil for 1 minute, then remove the pot from the stove. Cool wort for 15 minutes in an ice bath or chill with wort chiller. Strain into the primary fermenter and add water to obtain 5.25 gallons (20 L). Add yeast when wort has cooled to below 70 °F (21 °C).

Ferment at 68 to 72 °F (20 to 22 °C) for 7 days then rack into secondary. Ferment until target gravity has been reached and beer has cleared (3 weeks). Prime and bottle or keg and condition for 3 to 4 weeks. Store at cellar temperature.

All-grain option:
Acidify the mash water to below 7 pH. Mash 13.5 lbs. (6.1 kg) British two-row pale malt and the specialty grains in 5 gallons (19 L) of water at 154 °F (68 °C) for 90 minutes. Sparge with 5 gallons (19 L) of water at 5.7 pH and 168 °F (. The total boil time is approximately 90 to 120 minutes with the goal of ending the boil with 5.5 gallons (21 L) in the brewpot. Add hops as indicated by the extract recipe above.

Helpful Hints:
If your water is soft (below 50 ppm hardness), add 1/4 tsp. non-iodized table salt, 1-1/2 tsp. calcium carbonate (chalk) and 1/4 tsp. Epsom salts. If your water is moderate (between 50 to 200 ppm hardness), add 1/4 tsp. non-iodized table salt and 1/2 tsp. calcium carbonate. If your water is hard (greater than 300 ppm hardness), add 1/4 tsp. non-iodized table salt. This ale is ready to drink 2 months after it is carbonated. It will peak between 2 and 6 months and will last for up to 9 months at cellar temperatures.

My deepest thanks go to Andrés Erazo of Cervecería Quiteña for these recipes. These represent one approach to producing modern chicha beer, not the only way. The goal of this beer is a Champagne-like chicha beer, very dry and highly carbonated. See the "Sourcing Ingredients" section of the article for more information about obtaining some of these ingredients that are less common outside of South America.

Ingredients
5 lbs. (2.3 kg) malted corn
3 lbs. (1.4 g) Pilsner malt
1 lb. (450 g) unmalted wheat
3–4 oz. (85–113 g) Horchata lojana herbal tea blend
LalBrew Belle Saison, Wyeast 3711 (French Saison), or Yeast Bay Wallonian Farmhouse yeast
2 g Lallemand WildBrew Sour Pitch or other Lactobacillus of choice
Brettanomyces Bruxellensis of choice, such as Yeast Bay Beersel Brett Blend
¾ cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Mash the grains in 152 °F (67 °C) water for 60 minutes. Slowly ramp up to 170 °F (76 °C). Transfer mash to lauter tun lined with straw. Sparge slowly and collect 6.5 gallons (24.5 L) of wort.

Boil the wort for 90 minutes. Add herbal tea at knockout, stir, let steep for 20 minutes, then chill wort to 95 °F (35 °C). Run off half the wort into your first fermenter. Pitch the Lactobacillus in this fermenter and give it two or three days to sour at temperatures up to 104 °F (40 °C).

Chill the remainder of the wort to 68 °F (20 °C) and rack it into the second fermenter and then pitch the saison yeast. Allow yeast to free rise in temperature up to 79 °F (26 °C).

When the first (Lacto) fermentation is complete, mix it into the second fermenter, and allow the blended batch to ferment dry. When fermentation is complete, rack the beer, bottle condition with the Brett, or keg and force carbonate to 2.4 v/v.

Corn meal option:
Replace the malted corn with 4.5 lbs. (2 kg) pre-cooked white corn meal (such as P.A.N. brand), increase the Pilsner malt to 3.5 lbs. (1.6 kg), and eliminate the unmalted wheat from the all-grain recipe. Follow the same step-by-step instructions, adding the corn meal to the mash with the Pilsner malt.

Step by step
This recipe uses reverse osmosis (RO) water. Adjust all brewing water to a pH of 5.5 using phosphoric acid. Add 1 tsp. calcium chloride to the mash.

This recipe uses a step mash. Mash the Pilsner and dark Munich malts and the flaked rice in 16 quarts (15 L) water at 140 °F (60 °C) then step to 151 °F (66 °C) for 30 minutes. Step to 162 °F (72 °C) for 30 minutes. Add the rice hulls and dark grains, mix well. Begin recirculating, then raise to 172 °F
(78 °C) for 10 minutes. Allow a good filter bed to form with the rice hulls, keep recirculating.

Add the first wort hops in the kettle during sparging. Sparge slowly and collect 6.5 gallons (24.5 L) of wort. Boil the wort for 60 minutes.

Chill the wort to 50 °F (10 °C), pitch the yeast, and ferment for three days. Raise the temperature to 54 °F (12 °C), add the toasted coconut, ferment for one day. Raise the temperature to 57 °F (14 °C) until the beer reaches attenuation. Add vanilla extract before packaging.

Rack the beer, prime, and bottle condition, or keg and force carbonate.

SafLager W-34/70, or Wyeast 2124 (Bohemian Lager), or White Labs WLP830 (German Lager) yeast
3⁄4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by step
Use 6.5 gallons (24.5 L) of water in the brew kettle; heat to 158 °F (70 °C).

Steep the malts for 30 minutes. Remove and rinse. Turn off the heat. Add the malt extract and rice syrup and stir thoroughly to dissolve completely. You do not want to feel liquid extract at the bottom of the kettle when stirring with your spoon. Turn the heat back on, add the hops, and bring to a boil.

Boil the wort for 60 minutes, adding hops at the times indicated in the recipe.

Chill the wort to 50 °F (10 °C), pitch the yeast, and ferment for three days. Raise the temperature to 54 °F (12 °C), add the toasted coconut, ferment for one day. Raise the temperature to 57 °F (14 °C) until the beer reaches attenuation. Add vanilla extract before packaging.

Rack the beer, prime, and bottle condition, or keg and force carbonate.

Tips for Success:
Narcose makes their own vanilla extract, but for coconut uses commercial shredded toasted coconut. They soak cut up vanilla pods in grain alcohol to extract vanilla flavor. The usage rate varies based on extraction time and the quality of the vanilla, so they always do it to taste. Commercial (real) vanilla extract could be a substitute — added to taste.

Cervejaria UNIKA’s Catharina Sour with Strawberry & Coffee clone
Cervejaria UNIKA’s Catharina Sour with Strawberry & Coffee clone
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.049 FG = 1.008
IBU = 9 SRM = 3 ABV = 5.5%

A unique take on Catharina sour with the addition of strawberries and coffee from UNIKA, in Rancho Queimado, Brazil.

Ingredients
6 lbs. (2.7 kg) Pilsner malt
4 lbs. (1.8 kg) wheat malt
10 AAU Citra® hops (whirlpool) (0.67 oz./19 g at 15% alpha acids)
14 lbs. (6.4 kg) fresh strawberries
24 oz. (700 mL) cold-brewed coffee (light-bodied, fruity)
1.25 g Lactobacillus plantarum
1.25 g Lactobacillus casei
SafAle US-05, or Wyeast 1056 (American Ale), or White Labs WLP001 (California Ale) yeast
3⁄4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by step

This recipe uses reverse osmosis (RO) water. Adjust all brewing water to a pH of 5.5 using phosphoric acid. Add 1 tsp. calcium chloride to the mash.

This recipe uses a kettle souring method. In 15 quarts (14 L) water, mash the grain at 154 °F (68 °C) for 45 minutes. Sparge slowly and collect 6.5 gallons (24.5 L) of wort. Boil for 30 minutes without hops. Cool to 97 °F (36 °C) and pitch the Lactobacillus. Let it sour until a pH of 3.2 is reached (usually 36–48 hours). Boil for 45 minutes, adding the hops in the whirlpool after the boil is complete. Cool to 68 °F (20 °C) and pitch the ale yeast. More yeast than is normal may be needed due to the low pH.

Add the strawberries on the third day of active fermentation. Do not wait for fermentation to slow down, they must be added at high kräusen. The fermentation temperature can rise as high as 73 °F (23 °C), allow to ferment to completion. Cold crash the beer, rack off, then add the cold brewed coffee at packaging.

Prime and bottle condition, or keg and force carbonate.

(5 gallons/19 L, extract only)
OG = 1.049 FG = 1.008
IBU = 7 SRM = 3 ABV = 5.5%

Ingredients
6.6 lbs. (3 kg) wheat liquid malt extract
10 AAU Citra® hops (whirlpool) (0.67 oz./19 g at 15% alpha acids)
14 lbs. (6.4 kg) fresh strawberries
24 oz. (700 mL) cold-brewed coffee (light-bodied, fruity)
1.25 g Lactobacillus plantarum
1.25 g Lactobacillus casei
SafAle US-05, or Wyeast 1056 (American Ale), or White Labs WLP001 (California Ale) yeast
3⁄4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by step
Use 6.5 gallons (24.5 L) of water in the brew kettle. Heat to 158 °F (70 °C) and then turn off the heat. Add the malt extract and stir thoroughly to dissolve completely. You do not want to feel liquid extract at the bottom of the kettle when stirring with your spoon. Turn the heat back on and bring to a boil.

Boil for 30 minutes without hops. Cool to 97 °F (36 °C) and pitch the Lactobacillus. Let it sour until a pH of 3.2 is reached (usually 36–48 hours). Boil for 45 minutes, adding the hops in the whirlpool after the boil is complete. Cool to 68 °F (20 °C) and pitch the ale yeast. More yeast than is normal may be needed due to the low pH.

Follow the remainder of the instructions in the all-grain recipe.

Tips for Success:
The strawberries are prepared by washing, coring, and running them through a juicer, then using the juice and pulp. This is to create more surface area. Use very fresh, ripe strawberries in season. If strawberries are frozen, make sure they are frozen for no more than a week or two. Make sure to account for the extra volume needed in your fermenter for the strawberries.

The coffee is prepared by the cold brew method. Using a 7:1 ratio of water to coffee (7 oz. water per oz. of coffee beans by weight or 700 mL water per 100 g of coffee), combine coarsely ground coffee with cold filtered water, and let steep for 12 hours. Strain the coffee or use a French press. Use the indicated amount of the liquid coffee; measure the finished amount of liquid for the recipe. Use very fresh coffee, preferably from a local roaster who can grind it for you — be sure to tell them it’s for cold brew so they grind it coarsely.

Lactobacillus can be a pure pitch or obtained through probiotic drinks. The brewery uses Lactobacillus from an Italian pharmaceutical supplier, www.probiotical.com. It comes in 50 g sachets; they use 50 g of each in a 211-gallon (800-L) batch, so 2.5 g total should suffice for a 5-gallon (19-L) batch. Many brewers use just plantarum, so it isn’t vital to source both varieties. They switched from using probiotic drinks to make the product vegan-friendly, not because of problems with probiotics.

An Olde Ale was the first C.H.A.O.S. all-club barrel project and a recipe that is suitable for aging in any type of spirit barrel, but also tasty on its own.

Ingredients
15.5 lbs. (7 kg) Maris Otter pale ale malt
0.75 lb. (0.34 kg) carastan malt (35 °L)
0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) crystal malt (120 °L)
4 oz. (113 g) Special B® malt (180 °L)
1 lb. (0.45 g) treacle (120 min.)
6.8 AAU Fuggle hop pellets (60 min.) (1.5 oz./43 g at 4.5% alpha acids)
8.8 AAU East Kent Golding hop pellets (15 min.) (1.75 oz./50 g at 5.3% alpha acids)
2 oz. (57 g) East Kent Golding hop pellets (0 min.)
1/2 tsp. yeast nutrient (15 min.)
White Labs WLP002 (English Ale) or Wyeast 1968 (London ESB Ale) or Safale S-04 yeast
2/3 cup corn sugar (if priming)
Lallemand CBC-1 yeast (if priming)

Step by Step
Make a large starter several days in advance or brew a Bitter or Pale Ale and use the yeast cake from that beer to pitch into this beer.

On brew day, mix the milled grain in 5.3 gallons (20 L) of water at 150 ºF (66 ºC) for 60 minutes. Sparge with enough water to collect 7.5 gallons (28.4 L) wort. Total boil time is 120 minutes, adding the treacle as the wort comes to a boil and the first hop addition with 60 minutes remaining in the boil. Add the remaining hops and yeast nutrient per the schedule.

After the boil is complete, cool the wort to 66 ºF (19 ºC). Pitch your yeast and aerate the wort heavily. Hold at that temperature until primary fermentation is complete. Gently transfer to a secondary vessel or barrel of your choice. If you don’t have a barrel but would like some oak contribution, you can substitute oak cubes or staves that have been soaked in the spirit of your choice. Allow the beer to condition for an additional 1-6 months or until the beer is to your liking. Prime and bottle condition or keg and force carbonate to 2 volumes CO2. We recommend priming with a bottling yeast strain like Lallemand CBC-1 if the beer has been aging for several months.

Charlie's Gouden-Plenty Pils
Charlie's Gouden-Plenty Pils
(5 gallons/19 L, partial mash)
OG = 1.053 FG = 1.012
IBU = 15 SRM = 5 ABV = 5.5%

Ingredients
3 lbs. (1.36 kg) German Pilsner (or lager) malt
0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) Carapils malt
0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) wheat malt
5 lbs. (2.3 kg) Pilsen liquid malt extract
6 AAU Hallertauer hops (30 min.) (1.5 oz./43 g at 4% alpha acid)
0.5 oz. (14 g) dried licorice root (0 min.)
1 qt. slurry of German or Bohemian lager yeast (such as Wyeast 2007)
7/8 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Crack malted grains. Heat 6 qts. (5.7 L) water to 135 °F (57 °C), mix in malt. Hold at 123 °F (50 °C) for 30 min. Apply heat to raise mash temperature to 150 °F (66 °C). Hold at 150 °F (66 °C) for 45 min. Add heat, raising temperature to 159 °F (71 °C). Hold 15 min. Wash grains with 6 qts. (5.7 L) water at 170 °F (77 °C). You should have at least 3 gal. (11 L) in your kettle

Add the liquid malt to the kettle and stir until fully dissolved. Bring wort to a boil. Boil 15 min., then add the Hallertauer hops. Boil 30 min. more, then remove the heat and add the licorice. Cover and steep for 30 min. before beginning to chill. Pour into your fermenter (straining out the licorice, if you can) along with enough water to make up 5.25 gal (20 L). When cooled to 65 °F (18 °C), pitch yeast.

Ferment cold (45 to 50 °F/7 to 10 °C) for two weeks, then rack to your secondary. Lager cold (35 to 40 °F/2 to 4 °C max) for six weeks, then warm to 65 °F (18 °C) for 24 hours. Prime with corn sugar, bottle, age warm for one week or keg and force carbonate. Lager for another 2 to 4 weeks if you so desire.

All-grain option:
All-grain brewers replace the malt extract in the partial mash with 10 lbs. (4.5 kg) Pilsner malt. Mash in about 4 gal. (15 L), sparge with 5 gal. (19 L), and time your boil and hop schedule to reduce volume to 5.25 gal (20 L).

Extract with grains option:
All-extract brewers can increase the liquid malt to 7.5 lbs. (3.4 kg), delete the Pilsner and wheat malts, but steep the Carapils in the brewing water as it warms to 170 °F (77 °C), then remove grains and discard.

Hops:
Use any German-type hop you like, but stay subtle. You want to emphasize the licorice as a fine aroma and flavor, and much more than 15 IBUs will overwhelm that.

Licorice:
I use real, dried, shredded licorice root, available from Brewer’s Garden (ask your homebrew shop). You can also find "brewer’s licorice," which is a condensed, processed toffee-like stick that you break and/or shave to use. Dissolve it in the boil. Use as little as one-quarter of a stick, if that’s all you can find.

Yeast:
In the first few pilsners I made, I tried four or five different liquid yeasts from three different suppliers. I keep going back to Wyeast 2007 as the easiest to use and the most reliable, although Wyeast 2278 is also reliable, if a little more sulfury in the nose. The 2007, if worked up to a good-sized slurry, is a very clean yeast in terms of aroma, which is perfect for this recipe.

OG = 1.055 FG = 1.013
IBU = 34 SRM = 14 (pre-cherries) ABV = 5.3%

Ingredients
8 lbs. (3.6 kg) British pale ale malt
1 lb. (0.45 kg) aromatic malt
1/2 lb. (0.23 kg) Belgian caramel Munich malt
1/4 lb. (113 g) home toasted malt (see step by step)

1 lb. (0.45 kg) sour pie cherries (pitted & crushed)
Wyeast 1968 (London ESB Ale) Or White Labs WLP002 (English Ale) or Mangrove Jack's M15 (Empire Ale) yeast

Step by Step:
Toasted malt is made from pale malt, spread on a cookie sheet and toasted in the oven at 300 °F (150 °C) for one hour.

All grains mashed in at 130 °F (54 °C) for 1/2 hour. Raised to 154 °F (68 °C) and held for one hour. 6.5 gallons (24.6 L) of wort were drawn off and boiled for 90 minutes. Wort was chilled and aerated, and a vigorous ale yeast culture was added. I’m partial to ale yeasts with a noticeable diacetyl (butter) flavor, such as Wyeast’s 1968 London ESB.

After primary fermentation was completed, the beer was racked onto the fruit in an open fermenter. A new, vigorous fermentation kicked in (lots of sugar in those cherries!) and was allowed to finish out. The beer was racked again into a carboy and allowed to finish. After that, all procedures were normal.

Add extracts to kettle. Bring to a boil, add first hop addition. Boil 30 minutes, add second round of hops, then boil 15 more minutes. Remove from heat and cool. Top off in primary fermenter to 5.25 gals. (20 L) and, when cooled to 70 °F (21 °C) or so, pitch yeast.

Ferment at 65 °F (18 °C) for seven to 10 days, then rack onto cherries in your secondary fermenter. Condition on fruit 10 to 14 days then bottle, priming with corn sugar or keg and force carbonate. Cherry extract or liqueur can be used at packaging if more cherry flavor is desired.

Alternatives and Notes
All-grain brewers should mash 4 lbs. (1.8 kg) wheat malt and an additional 3 lbs. (1.4 kg) pale malt, in place of the extract. Mash in 12 qts. (11.4 L) of water at 151 to 153 °F (66 to 67 °C) for 90 minutes. Sparge with 4.25 gallons (16 L) at 170 °F (77 °C). Follow the recipe, except boil long enough to reduce to 5.25 gals (20 L).

Yeast: This is a brew that requires a special yeast. The Wyeast 3944 or White Labs WLP400 are both ideal. I also like to try to use recultured "classic" yeasts, such as Hoegaarden and Blanche de Bruges, whenever possible. I don't recommend using dry yeast, but Safale T-58 could be used if in a pinch.

Fruit: Naturally, the whole idea here is that you can tailor any recipe to your own tastes, so please don't feel limited to cherries. Raspberries, strawberries, mangos, peaches, anything you like might work well. The method I've outlined here and elsewhere for using fresh fruit is the best for my brewing system. Other possibilities include steeping the fruit in the cooling wort for 15 minutes or so and then putting the fruit (in a mesh bag) into the primary; adding fruit juice or flavoring essence to the secondary; and adding fruit essence with priming sugar, or a fruit-flavored liqueur instead of priming sugar, when you bottle.

Spices: The "original" witbiers have a combination of fruit (bitter orange) and spices, usually coriander. My recipe above does not call for spices, but it could. What spices go well with cherries? They'd probably need to be of the pungent/peppery variety, such as cardamom, black pepper, or grains of paradise. Try what you like.

Chief’s Blizzard BBQ Ribs
Chief’s Blizzard BBQ Ribs

BBQ’ing is a year round sport, especially if you are in the Army and
snow-bound overseas. I have traveled around the world on Uncle’s dime
for about 15 years and have been perfecting this recipe. We always have
a "first snow" BBQ when we were stationed in England. The real secret
is the smoking method with the mesquite wood and using John Boy and
Billy sauce.

The best beer for this is a light (lawnmower) ale or a fresh batch
of Cooper’s draught. It keeps you going for the long hours of watching
your meat cook.

Ingredients:

5 lbs. of baby back pork ribs
1 jar of John boy and Billy’s Hot and spicy BBQ sauce
Hungarian paprika rub
Lawry’s season salt
freshly cracked peppercorns
garlic powder
Old Bay seasoning salt
Fire:

charcoal is best
mesquite chunks (soak in water 30 minutes prior to cooking)
old soup can full of water
Ribs prep:

First thing is to wash the ribs off in cool water and
remove the lung lining from the back (Concave) side of the ribs. This
will ensure full flavor penetration.
Cut the ribs into 4 inch sections (about every two rib bones), lay out on a clean surface and prepare to spice.
Sprinkle the paprika on the ribs and hand rub the spice into the meat. Be sure to spice both sides and the ends.
Sprinkle Season salt, fresh pepper, garlic and Old Bay to taste on both
sides of the ribs and the ends to taste. Set aside and get the fire
ready.
Fire prep:

Start the charcoal in the left side of a charcoal grill (smoker).
After the coals are gray, clear an area in the center of the coals and
place the soup tin full of water in it and move coals next to the tin.
Place a couple of mesquite chunks in the fire and let them flame up for a couple of minutes.
Place the cooking grates on the grill.
Ribs cooking:

Don’t let the grill get past 300 ºF (149º C) if possible.
Place the ribs on the right side of the grill for offset cooking and
close the lid and choke the chimney for maximum smoke (about 80%
closed).
Let the ribs smoke for about one hour and try not to open the lid.
After one hour, open the chimney to about 50% and throw another small
chunk of mesquite wood on the coals and allow it to flame up.
Move the ribs to the left side of the grill for direct cooking and cook until done (lid closed).
Brush a generous amount of John Boy and Billy sauce on the ribs and
turn them, repeating the process on the other side. Brush once more
before you take them off the grill.
You will have the best
tasting ribs with a nice smoke ring around the outside of the meat.
Enjoy with a homebrew and some Texas Toast thrown on the grill after
the work is done.
Cleaning tip:

When you are done using your cutting board, spray it off with hot
water and use the following method to make it fresh. Pour a few capfuls
of lemon juice on the cutting board and sprinkle it with salt. Scrub
the board with a fresh sponge and when done, the board should be void
of all smells.

Choc clone
Choc clone
(5 gallons/19 L, partial mash)
OG = 1.041 FG = 1.009
IBU = 9 SRM = 2.5 ABV = 4.1%

This beer has had many different variants. This clone recipe is close to the current version, which is a cloudy, unfiltered wheat/barley beer with some funky ale flavors, 4.0% alcohol, lots of fruitiness from a warm fermented Hefeweizen yeast. Choc is bottle conditioned, and not filtered prior to bottling, so it can have large amounts of sedimentation at the bottom of the bottle. There is also a bit of lemony flavor to Choc, typical of a wheat beer.

Ingredients
3.5 lbs. (1.6 kg) Briess Weizen dried malt extract
0.50 lb. (0.23 kg) 2-row pale malt
0.50 lb. (0.23 kg) white wheat malt
0.50 lb. (0.23 kg) CaraPils® malt
0.50 lb. (0.23 kg) torrified wheat
1.3 AAU Cascade hop pellets (60 min) (0.25 oz./7 g of 5.0% alpha acid)
1.3 AAU Cascade hop pellets (15 min) (0.25 oz./7 g of 5.0% alpha acid)
1.0 AAU Liberty hop pellets (5 min) (0.25 oz./7 g of 4.0% alpha acid)
White Labs WLP320 (American Hefeweizen) yeast
0.75 cups (150 g) corn sugar (for priming)

Step by Step
Steep the crushed grains in 2.8 qts. (2.6 L) of water at 150 °F (65 °C) for 30 minutes. Remove grains from the wort and rinse with 2 quarts (1.8 L) of hot water. Add half the dried malt extract and water to make at least 3 gallons (11 L). Boil wort for 60 minutes, adding the hops per the recipe schedule. For the last 5 minutes of the boil, add the remaining dried malt extract. Cool wort, transfer to fermenter and top up with cold water to 5.0 gallons (19 L). Pitch your yeast when the beer has cooled to 68 °F (20 °C), and aerate. Choc is served cloudy, so don’t worry about racking to a secondary fermenter. Bottle with ¾ cup of corn sugar about 3 days after you hit your final gravity. Let it bottle condition for one week. This is homebrew, proudly serve this beer in a mason jar after rolling the bottle on the table to mix the yeast back into suspension!

All-grain option:
This is a single step infusion mash using 4.5 lbs. (2.0 kg) of pale 2-row malt, 3.5 lbs. (1.6 kg) of white wheat malt, 0.5 lb. (0.22 kg) of Carapils® malt and 0.5 lb. (0.22 kg) of torrified wheat. Mash at 154 °F (68 °C). Boil for 90 minutes. Fermentation is the same as in the extract recipe.

OG = 1.054 FG = 1.013
IBU = 28 SRM = 32 ABV = 5.4%

Ingredients
9.5 lbs. (4.3 kg) American two-row malt
12 oz. (0.68 kg) chocolate malt
4 oz. (113 g) Weyermann Carafa Special III malt
4 oz. (113 g) crystal malt (90 °L)
8 oz. (0.23 kg) flaked barley
5.7 AAU Cascade hops (40 min.) (1 oz./28 g at 5.7% alpha acids)
4.3 AAU German Hallertauer hops (20 min.) (1 oz. 28 g at 4.3% alpha acids)
1 oz. (28 g) unsweetened cocoa powder (0 min.)
1 tsp. calcium chloride
Wyeast 2308 (Munich Lager) or White Labs WLP838 (Southern German Lager) yeast
3/4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
This is a multi-step mash. If you do not want to perform a step mash, a single infusion mash at 152 °F (67 °C) should be sufficient. Bring 14 qts. (13.3 L) of water to 135 °F (57 °C). Add malts and barley and the temperature should settle around 128 °F (53 °C). Hold for a 30-minute protein rest. Bump temperature to 152 °F (67 °C) and hold for one hour. Bump again to 168 °F (76 °C) for five minutes.

Sparge with 4 qts. (4 L) of 180 °F (82 °C) water. Boil wort 35 minutes and add Cascades. Boil 20 more minutes and add Hallertau hops. Boil 20 more minutes. At the end of the boil, add the cocoa powder and give the wort a long stir to create a whirlpool. Let settle for 15 minutes, then begin to chill. Pitch yeast at 62 °F (17 °C) and hold this temperature for 24 hours. Reduce temperature to 54 °F (12 °C) and ferment in primary for fourteen days. You may need to provide a diacetyl rest at 68 °F (20 °C) for 2 days if needed. Bottle or kegs as normal.

0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) crystal malt (60 °L)
5 lbs. (2.27 kg) Pilsen dried malt extract
2 AAU Tettnanger hops (60 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 4% alpha acids)
2.5 AAU Spalt hops (15 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 5% alpha acids)
2 AAU Tettnanger hops (5 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 4% alpha acid)
2.5 AAU Spalt hops (5 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 5% alpha acids)
4 Tbsp. unsweetened ground cocoa (5 min.)
1 qt. (1 L) yeast slurry of Wyeast 2308 (Munich lager) or similar
2/3 cup corn sugar for priming

Step by Step
Heat 1.75 gal. (6.6 L) of water to 166 °F (74 °C), submerge the cracked grains. Hold at 154 °F (68 °C) for 60 min. Wash the grains with 2 gal. (7.6 L) water at 169 °F (76 °C). Add dried malt extract to kettle off heat and when fully dissolved, bring wort to a boil. Total boil is 60 min. Add the hops according to the schedule and the cocoa into the boil with 5 min. remaining, then turn off the heat. Add to fermenter along with enough water to make 5.25 gal (20 L). Cool to 60 °F (16 °C). Pitch yeast.

Seal and ferment cool (55 to 60 °F/13 to 16 °C) for two weeks. Rack to secondary if you desire and age cold (40 °F/4 °C) for two to four weeks. Prime with corn sugar, bottle, or keg and force carbonate.

All-grain version:
Increase pilsner malt to 11 lbs. (5 kg), mash water to 4.5 gal. (17.2 L), and sparge water to 5 gal. (19 L). Adjust boiling time to suit your rate of evaporation and maintain the hop schedule as above.

Extract with grains version:
Omit the pilsner malt, Munich and Vienna malts. Steep Carapils and crystal malt in 3 gal. (11 L) of water as temperature comes up to 160 °F (71 °C), then remove grains and bring liquid to a boil. Increase Pilsen dried malt extract to 6 lbs. (2.7 kg) and add 1.5 lbs. (0.68 kg) Munich dried malt extract and proceed as above.

A note about cocoa:
Cocoa and hot chocolate mix are not the same thing. In this recipe (and elsewhere in your brewing adventures) you only want to use cocoa, that is, the extract of the cocoa bean, not a prepared chocolate containing milk solids, sugars, preservatives, and so forth. Try for the most pure cocoa you can find, unsweetened, unpreserved. A word of caution: Cocoa contains lipids and fats, which reduce foam retention.

(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.129 FG = 1.040
IBU = 50 SRM = 90 ABV = 13.7%

Ingredients
19 lbs. (8.6 kg) British 2-row pale malt
1.62 lbs. (0.73 kg) Munich malt (10 °L)
2.16 lbs. (0.98 kg) roasted barley malt (450 °L)
2.16 lbs. (0.98 kg) crystal malt (60 °L)
1.35 lbs. (0.61 kg) chocolate malt
13 oz. (0.37 kg) Belgian debittered black malt (550 °L)
10 AAU Willamette hops (75 min.) (2 oz./57 g at 5% alpha acids)
5 AAU Willamette hops (30 min.) (1 oz./28 g at 5% alpha acids)
1 oz. (28 g) Willamette hops (0 min.)
1⁄2 tsp. yeast nutrient (15 min.)
2 sachets Fermentis US-05 or White Labs WLP001 (California Ale) or Wyeast 1056 (American Ale) yeast
3⁄4 cup corn sugar (if priming)
Lallemand CBC-1 yeast (if priming)

Step by Step
If opting to use a liquid yeast strain, make a large starter several days in advance or brew a smaller beer and use the yeast from that beer to re-pitch into this beer.

This is a single step infusion mash. Mix all of the crushed grains with 7.75 gallons (29.5 L) of 170 °F (77 °C) water to stabilize at 155 ºF (68 ºC). Sparge with enough water, about 4 gallons (15 L), to collect 7.5 gallons (28.4 L) wort. Your pre-boil SG should be approximately 1.086. Supplement with dried malt extract if your gravity reading is low. Total boil time is 120 minutes, adding the first hop addition with 75 minutes remaining in the boil. Add the remaining hops and yeast nutrient per the schedule.

After the boil is complete, cool the wort to 66 ºF (19 ºC). Pitch your yeast and aerate the wort heavily. Hold at that temperature until primary fermentation is complete. Gently transfer to a secondary vessel or bourbon barrel of your choice. If you don’t have a barrel, you can substitute oak cubes or staves that have soaked in a bourbon of your choice. Allow the beer to condition for an additional 1–6 months or until the beer is to your liking. Prime and bottle condition or keg and force carbonate to 2.2 volumes CO2. It is recommended to prime with a bottling yeast strain like Lallemand CBC-1 if the beer has been aging for several months.

3⁄4 cup corn sugar (if priming)
Lallemand CBC-1 yeast (if priming)

Step by Step
If opting to use a liquid yeast strain, make a large starter several days in advance or brew a smaller beer and use the yeast from that beer to re-pitch into this beer.

On brew day, place the crushed grains in a large muslin bag. Steep the milled grain in 3 gallons (11.5 L) of water at 160 ºF (71 ºC) for 20 minutes. Remove the grain bag and place in a colander. Wash with 1 gallon (3.9 L) hot water. Add the liquid and dried malt extract and stir until fully dissolved. Top off to 6.5 gallons (24.6 L) and bring to a boil. When the wort comes to a boil, add the first hop addition and boil for a total of 75 minutes. Add the remaining hops and yeast nutrient per the schedule.

After the boil is complete, cool the wort to 66 ºF (19 ºC). Pitch your yeast and aerate the wort heavily. Hold at that temperature until primary fermentation is complete.

On a cold winter's night, build a fire and pour a glass of this beer to make a memorable beer moment.

OG = 1.090 (21.6 °P) FG = 1.022 (5.6 °P)
IBU = 43 SRM = 20 ABV = 9%

Ingredients
17.5 lb. (8 kg) Crisp Maris Otter or British-style pale ale malt (3 °L)
11 oz. (312 g) Briess crystal malt (80 °L)
3.5 oz. (99 g) Briess black patent malt (525 °L)
0.5 lb. (227 g) Lyle's Black Treacle (100 °L) (optional)
10.4 AAU Horizon hops (60 min.) (0.8 oz/23 g of 13% alpha acids)
1⁄2 tsp. cinnamon (ground, dry) (1 min.)
1⁄4 tsp. ginger (ground, dry) (1 min.)
1⁄8 tsp. nutmeg (ground, dry) (1 min.)
1⁄8 tsp. allspice (ground, dry) (1 min.)
White Labs WLP013 (London Ale), Wyeast 1028 (London Ale) or Danstar Nottingham yeast.

Step by Step
Mill the grains and dough-in targeting a mash of around 1.5 quarts of water to 1 pound of grain (a liquor-to-grist ratio of about 3:1 by weight) and a temperature of 152 °F (67 °C). Hold the mash at 152 °F (67 °C) until conversion is complete, which should be less than 60 minutes. Raise the temperature to mash out at 168 °F (76 °C).

Sparge slowly with 170 °F (77 °C) water, collecting wort until the pre-boil kettle volume is around 6.5 gallons (25 L) and the gravity is 1.070 (17 °P). Optionally, add treacle to the wort stirring thoroughly to avoid scorching.

The total wort boil time is 90 minutes. Add the bittering hops with 60 minutes left in the boil. Add Irish moss or other kettle finings with 15 minutes remaining and the spices with one minute left in the boil. Chill the wort rapidly to 67 °F (19 °C), let the break material settle, rack to the fermenter and aerate thoroughly.

Pitch 15 grams of properly rehydrated dry yeast or use three liquid yeast packages. Alternatively, make a 5-liter starter using one package of liquid yeast, letting the starter ferment out fully and pitching only the resulting yeast into the wort.

Ferment at 68 °F (20 °C), raising the temperature to 70 °F (21 °C) during the last 1⁄3 of fermentation to help reduce diacetyl and assure complete attenuation. Allow the lees to settle and the brew to mature without pressure for another two days after fermentation appears finished.

Rack to a keg and force carbonate or rack it to a bottling bucket, add priming sugar, and bottle. Target a carbonation level of 1.5 to 2 volumes.

Christmas in a Bottle
(5 gallons/19 L, extract with grains)
OG = 1.090 (21.6 °P) FG = 1.022 (5.6 °P)
IBU = 43 SRM = 21 ABV =9%

Ingredients
11.7 lb. (5.3 kg) Maris Otter or fresh equivalent English-type liquid malt extract (3.5 °L)
11 oz. (312 g) crystal malt (80 °L)
3.5 oz. (99 g) black patent malt (525 °L)
10.4 AAU Horizon hops (60 min.) (0.8 oz/23 g of 13% alpha acids)
1⁄2 tsp. cinnamon (ground, dry) (1 min.)
1⁄4 tsp. ginger (ground, dry) (1 min.)
1⁄8 tsp. gutmeg (ground, dry) (1 min.)
1⁄8 tsp allspice (ground, dry) (1 min.)
0.5 lb (227 g) Lyle's Black Treacle (100 °L) (optional)
White Labs WLP013 (London Ale), Wyeast 1028 (London Ale) or Danstar Nottingham yeast

Step by Step
Mill or coarsely crack the specialty malts. Mix them well and place loosely in a grain bag. Avoid packing the grains too tightly in the bag, using more bags if needed. Steep the grain bag in about 3 quarts (~3 liters) of water at roughly 170 °F (77 °C) for about 30 minutes.

Lift the grain bag out of the steeping liquid and rinse with warm water. Allow the bags to drip into the kettle for a few minutes while you add the malt extract and the optional treacle. Do not squeeze the bags. Add enough water to the steeping liquor and malt extract to make a pre-boil volume of 5.9 gallons (22 L) and a gravity of 1.077 (18.7 °P). Stir thoroughly to help dissolve the extract and bring to a boil.

Once the wort is boiling, add the bittering hops. The total wort boil time is one hour after adding the bittering hops. Add Irish moss or other kettle finings with 15 minutes remaining and the spices with one minute left in the boil.

Chill the wort to 68 °F (20 °C). Aerate thoroughly and pitch 15 grams of properly rehydrated dry yeast or use three liquid yeast packages. Alternatively, make a 5-liter starter using one package of liquid yeast. Ferment at 68 °F (20 °C), raising the temperature to 70 °F (21 °C) during the last 1⁄3 of fermentation to help reduce diacetyl and assure complete attenuation. Allow the lees to settle and the brew to mature without pressure for another two days after fermentation appears finished.

Rack to a keg and force carbonate or rack it to a bottling bucket, add priming sugar, and bottle. Target a carbonation level of 1.5 to 2 volumes.

Christmas Present Olde Ale
Christmas Present Olde Ale
(5 gallons/19 L, partial mash)
OG = 1.065 FG = 1.020
IBU = 40 SRM = 20 ABV = 5.8%

Ingredients
4 lbs. (1.8 kg) pale malt
1 lb. (0.45 kg) medium crystal malt (40° to 50° Lovibond)
0.25 lb. (113 g) chocolate malt
0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) wheat malt
10 oz. (0.28 kg) black treacle
4 lbs. (1.8 kg) unhopped amber dried malt extract
1 tsp. gypsum
1 tsp. calcium carbonate
6 AAU Kent Goldings hops (60 min.) (1.5 oz./43 g at 4% alpha acids)
4 AAU Fuggle hops (60 min.) (1 oz./28 g at 4% alpha acid)
English Ale yeast (Wyeast 1968 or White Labs WLP002)
2/3 cup brown sugar for priming

Step by Step
Crack the grains. Treat 2 gal. (7.6 L) water with one teaspoon each of gypsum and calcium carbonate. Heat to 164 °F (73 °C). Add grains, gently mix in. Mash should settle at 152 °F (67 °C) or so. Hold for 60 min. Wash the grains with 2 gallons (7.6 L) hot water (~ 168 °F/76 °C) and top off the kettle to 6.5 gallons (24.6 L).

Turn off heat and add the treacle and dried malt extract, and stir until all everything is dissolved. Bring to a boil, total boil time is 90 min. Boil 30 min., then add both the Goldings and the Fuggle hops. Boil 60 min. more.

Remove from heat, chill, and add to primary fermenter with enough chilled pre-boiled water to make 5.25 gal (20 L). When cooled to 70 °F (21 °C), pitch yeast.

Ferment warm, ~68 °F (20 °C) for three or four days, then move to a cooler place, 60 °F (16 °C) for a week to 10 days. Rack to secondary if you so desire and age cool for three to four weeks more. Prime with brown sugar, bottle, and allow time for proper carbonation or keg and force carbonate.

This beer will be drinkable in one month but will be better in three. You may find (if it lasts) that a two-year-old bottle will be wonderful.

All extract with grains version
Omit the pale malt and wheat malt. Start by steeping the crystal and chocolate malts in 2 gal. (7.6 L) of water, gradually raising the temperature to 170 °F (77 °C). Remove the grains and add the treacle and 6.5 lbs. (3 kg) dried malt extract. Hop and boil as above. It will be good, but not quite as rich as the partial-mash.

All-grain option:
Increase the pale malt to 11.5 lbs. (5.2 kg), mash with crystal, chocolate, and wheat in 4.25 gal. (16 L) of water; sparge with 5 gal (19 L). Collect 6.5 or 7 gal. (24.6 or 26.5 L) of wort, then boil long enough to reduce to 5.25 gallons (20 L) with hop schedule as above.

Treacle: Treacle is, of course, a variant of molasses. Many homebrew shops now carry it regularly. If yours doesn’t, ask them to. Otherwise, in a pinch you might get away with dark (unsulphured) molasses, but use a couple ounces more as it is not as rich as the treacle.

OG = 1.050 (12.3 °P) FG = 1.011 (2.7 °P)
IBUs = 40 SRM = 6 ABV = 5.1%

This is an all-grain version of my first American Pale Ale recipe. It won gold medals in five different competitions before my wife drank it all.

Ingredients
8.5 lbs (3.86 kg) American two-row malt
0.25 lb (113 g) crystal malt (20 °L)
0.5 lb (226 g) Caravienne malt
7 AAU Columbus whole hops (0.5 oz/14g at 14% alpha acids) (60 min.)
5.5 AAU Centennial whole hops (15 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 11% alpha acids)
3 AAU Cascade whole hops (5 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 6% alpha acids)
6 AAU Cascade whole hops (0 min.) (1 oz./28 g at 6% alpha acids)
1.5 oz (43 g) Centennial whole hops (dry hop)
Wyeast 1272 (American Ale II) or White Labs WLP051 (California Ale V) or Mangrove Jack M36 (Liberty Bell Ale) yeast

Step by Step
Mill grains and dough-in using RO water until a medium thickness mash is achieved. Treat mash with 1 tsp calcium chloride. Hold mash at 152 °F (67 °C) until conversion is complete. Sparge slowly with 170 °F (77 °C) RO water treated with 2 tsp phosphoric acid, collecting 6 gallons (22.7 L). Bring wort to a boil.

After the hot break, add the first charge of bittering hops. Boil for 60 additional minutes, adding the other hops per the hopping schedule. Allow the wort to rest for 5 minutes, then chill rapidly to 65 °F (18 °C). Rack to fermenter, leaving break material behind. Oxygenate, pitch the yeast, and ferment at 68 °F (20 °C). Fermentation should be done in less than a week, but don't rush it.

After the yeast has mostly settled, prepare a secondary fermenter (carboy). Blow in some CO2 to displace any oxygen, add the dry hops and rack the fermented beer on top of the dry hops, minimizing splashing. Leave the beer in contact with the hops for a week.

Rack to a keg and force carbonate, or rack to a bottling bucket, add priming sugar and bottle. Target a carbonation level of 2 to 2.5 volumes.

Variation: Add 0.5 lb (0.23 kg) Orange Blossom honey in the last 15 min of the boil.

Classic American Pilsner
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.060 (14.7 °P) FG = 1.014 (3.6 °P)
IBU = 35 SRM = 4 ABV = 6%

Ingredients
4.4 lb. (2 kg) Great Western domestic two-row malt (2 °L)
4.4 lb. (2 kg) Best Malz continental Pilsner malt (2 °L)
3.3 lb. (1.5 kg) flaked corn (1 °L)
6.5 AAU Czech Saaz hops (60 min.) (1.87 oz./53 g at 3.5% alpha acids)
3.5 AAU Czech Saaz hops (15 min.) (1 oz./28 g of 3.5% alpha acids)
3.5 AAU Czech Saaz hops (0 min.) (1 oz./28 g of 3.5% alpha acids)
White Labs WLP800 (Pilsner Lager) or Wyeast 2001 (Pilsner Urquell H-Strain) or Saflager 34/70 yeast

Step by Step
Mill the grains and dough-in targeting a mash of around 1.5 quarts of water to 1 pound of grain (a liquor-to-grist ratio of about 3:1 by weight) and a temperature of 149 °F (65 °C). Hold the mash at 149 °F (65 °C) until enzymatic conversion is complete. You might want to extend your mash time, due to the lower mash temperature and the need to convert the corn. Infuse the mash with near boiling water while stirring or with a recirculating mash system raise the temperature to mash out at 168 °F (76 °C). Sparge slowly with 170 °F (77 °C) water, collecting wort until the pre-boil kettle volume is around 6.5 gallons (24.4 L) and the gravity is 1.046 (11.5 °P).

The total boil time will be 90 minutes. Add the bittering hops 30 minutes after the wort starts boiling. Add Irish moss or other kettle finings and the second hop addition with 15 minutes left in the boil. Add the last hop addition just before shutting off the burner. Chill the wort rapidly to 50 °F (10 °C), let the break material settle, rack to the fermenter, pitch the yeast and aerate thoroughly.

You will need to pitch 4 packages of fresh yeast or make a large starter to have enough yeast to best ferment this beer. You might consider first brewing a small batch of lower gravity Munich helles or something similar to grow up the yeast you need. Once you have pitched enough clean, healthy yeast, ferment at 50 °F (10 °C). When fermentation is finished, carbonate the beer to approximately 2.5 volumes.

Ingredients
6 lb. (2.7 kg) Pilsner liquid malt extract (2 °L)

White Labs WLP800 (Pilsner Lager) or Wyeast 2001 (Pilsner Urquell H-Strain) or Saflager 34/70 yeast

Step by Step
I have used a number of Pilsner-type extracts, all with success. Always choose the freshest extract that fits the beer style. If you cannot get fresh liquid malt extract, use an appropriate amount of dried extract instead. Using fresh extract is very important to this style. Finding high maltose rice or corn syrups can be difficult in smaller quantities, but some homebrew shops do carry them. Alternatively, you could use dextrose in place of the syrup. Ideally, you would do a partial mash with corn or leave this style to all-grain.

Ingredients
4 lb. 6 oz. (2.0 kg) extra light dried malt extract
12 oz. (0.34 kg) dark Munich malt (20 °L)
3 oz. (85 g) biscuit malt
8 oz. (0.23 kg) crystal malt (60 °L)
3 oz. (85 g) crystal malt (120-150 °L)
5 oz. (142 g) chocolate malt
6 AAU Northern Brewer hops (60 min.) (0.66 oz./19 g of 9% alpha acids)
1.5 AAU First Gold hops (15 min.) (0.3 oz./8.5 g of 5% alpha acids)
1.0 AAU Fuggles hops (15 min.) (0.2 oz./5.6 g of 5% alpha acids)

1 tsp. Irish moss
Wyeast 1272 (American Ale II) or White Labs WLP051 (California V) or Mangrove Jack's M36 (Liberty Bell Ale) yeast (1.5 qt./~1.5 L yeast starter)
7/8 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step:
Place crushed grains in a nylon steeping bag. In a large kitchen pot, heat 3.0 qts. (2.8 L) of water to 166 °F (74 °C). Submerge grain bag in water and let steep at 155 °F (68 °C) for 30 minutes. (The temperature will drop a bit during the steep, but this won’t hurt.) While grains are steeping, heat 1.5 qts. (~1.5 L) of water to 170 °F (77 °C) in a sauce pan. Also, begin heating 2 gallons (7.6 L) of water to a boil in your brewpot. When steeping is done, place a colander over your brewpot and lift the grain bag into it. Pour the "grain tea" through the bag (which will strain out most of the grain bits), then rinse the bag with the 1.5 qts. (~1.5 L) of 170 °F (77 °C) water.

Heat the (roughly) 3 gallons (11 L) of wort in your brewpot to a boil, then stir in dried malt extract. (It will foam a bit, so don’t pour all the extract in at once.) Bring the wort back to a boil, add the first charge hops and boil for 60 minutes. Add Irish moss and two flavor hops with 15 minutes left in boil. Add aroma hops at the end of the boil.

After the boil, put a lid on your brewpot and cool the wort (either in a cold-water bath in your sink or with a wort chiller). Cool until the side of the brewpot no longer feels warm. Transfer wort to your fermenter and top up to 5 gallons (19 L) with cool water. Aerate the wort and pitch your yeast. Ferment at 68 °F (20 °F). When fermentation slows to halt, rack to secondary. Bottle with corn sugar (or keg) one week later.

Coach House Post Horn Premium Ale won Gold for Strong Bitter/Ale in 1994. It is described as a "Dry golden bitter with a blackcurrant fruitiness and good hop flavours leading to a strong, dry finish." From this I would suggest a yeast that provides a dry character.The data I have for this beer is OG: 1.050. Malt bill: 94.5% Maris Otter pale malt, 5.5% pale crystal malt. Hops: Fuggles, Target. Dry hops: Yes. IBU: 38. EBC: 18.

Ingredients
9 lbs. 10 oz. (4.4 kg) Maris Otter pale malt
8.5 oz. (240 g) crystal malt (40 °L)
7.2 AAU Target hops (90 min.) (0.65 oz./18 g at 11% alpha acids)
2.3 AAU Fuggle hops (90 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 4.5% alpha acids)
9 AAU Fuggle hops (0 min.) (2 oz./57 g at 4.5% alpha acids)
1 tsp. Irish moss
White Labs WLP005 (British Ale), Wyeast 1098 (British Ale), or Wyeast 1335 (British Ale II) yeast
2/3 cup (133 g) dextrose (if priming)

Step by Step
Mash the grains at 150 °F (66 °C) for 60 minutes. Mash out, vorlauf, and then sparge at 170 °F (77 °C) to collect enough wort to result in 5 gallons (19 L) after a 90-minute boil. Boil 90 minutes, adding hops at times indicated. Cool, aerate, and pitch yeast. Ferment at 70 °F (21 °C). After fermentation is complete, bottle or keg as usual.

Extract with grains option:
Decrease the Maris Otter pale malt in the all-grain recipe to 1.5 lb. (0.68 kg), and add 1.75 lbs. (0.79 kg) Briess light dried malt extract and 3.75 lbs. (1.7 kg) Briess light liquid malt extract. Steep crushed grains in 3 qts. (3 L) of water at 150 °F (66 °C) for 45 minutes. Combine "grain tea," water, and dried malt extract to make 3 gallons (11 L) of wort. Boil for 90 minutes, adding hops at times indicated and liquid malt extract in the last 15 minutes of the boil. Follow the remaining portion of the all-grain recipe.

Step by Step
With a somewhat thick mash, and a fairly hard water profile featuring at least 50 ppm of calcium, target a mash temperature of 148 °F (64 °C) and mash for 90 minutes or until conversion is complete. Recirculate (vorlauf) 2 gallons (7.6 L) of wort from the bottom to the top of your mash tun to set the grain bed, then sparge with 5 gallons (19 L) of water at 170 °F (77 °C) and collect about 7 gallons (26 L) of runoff to your boil kettle.

Boil for 90 minutes and add the hops, apples (in a muslin bag if using fresh apples), and spices at the times indicated in the ingredients list. At flameout, rapidly chill the wort to 60 °F (16 °C) and transfer the wort to your fermenter.

Pitch the yeast, oxygenate thoroughly, and ferment at about 65 °F (18 °C). Once fermentation is near completion after two weeks, raise the temperature to 70 °F (21 °C) to perform a diacetyl rest for two days. Then cool the beer about 6 °F (3 °C) per day for four days to help clear the beer. Rack the beer into a keg and force carbonate to 2.5 volumes (or prime and bottle condition). If bottle conditioning, leave the beer at 70–75 °F (21–24 °C) for a week or two. Lager at 35 °F (2 °C) for two weeks to a month. Serve at 40–45 °F (4–7 °C).

Step by Step

This recipe uses a multi-step infusion mash. Dough in at around 104 °F (40 °C) for a hydration rest of 15 minutes. Raise the temperature to 122 °F (50 °C) for a protein rest of 15 minutes. Raise the temperature to 149 °F (65 °C) for a beta amylase rest of 30 minutes. Raise the temperature to 162 °F (72 °C) for an alpha amylase rest of 30 minutes. Raise temperature to 169 °F (76 °C) for the mash-out. Recirculate wort then begin sparge.

Boil for 75 minutes, adding hops as indicated. At the end of the boil, turn off heat and whirlpool for 15 minutes. Heat-exchange to the high end of the temperature range for the selected yeast. As soon as primary fermentation is vigorous, reduce the tank temperature to the low end of the yeast’s temperature range. After 7 additional days, give the beer a diacetyl rest by raising the tank temperature to 66 °F (19 °C) and hold it there for about 2 days.

Rack and reduce the beer temperature for lagering by 2 °F (1 °C ) a day until reaching 31 °F (–1 °C) or close to it, equipment permitting. The lagering temperature should definitely not be higher than 38 °F (3.5 °C). Lager for 4 to 6 weeks. Some brewers may shorten the lagering time to 2 to 4 weeks, others will lengthen it to 12 weeks. Rack again. Carbonate to 2.55 to 3 volumes of CO2.

(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.059 FG = 1.011
IBU = 20.5 SRM = 4 ABV = 6.2%

Ingredients
2.4 lbs. (1.1 kg) Sunny State Products Heritage Organic Blue Corn
4.4 lbs. (2 kg) Rahr Premium Pils malt
4.4 lbs. (2 kg) Weyermann Pilsner malt
7 oz. (200 g) Weyermann pale wheat malt
4 oz. (113 g) Weyermann acidulated malt
4 oz. (113 g) Weyermann Carahell® malt
6 oz. (170 g) rice hulls (optional)
2.1 AAU Czech Saaz hops (60 min.) (0.4 oz./11 g at 5.3% alpha acids)
2.2 AAU Motueka™ hops (60 min.) (0.45 oz./13 g at 4.9% alpha acids)
1 g Yeastex 82 (or equivalent yeast nutrient) (15 min.)
1 g Whirlfloc (or 1/2 tablet) (15 min.)
Wyeast 2142 (Bohemian Lager), White Labs WLP830 (German Lager), or Mangrove Jack’s M84 (Bohemian Lager) yeast
¾ cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Cereal mash: Mill blue corn and 0.9 lbs. (0.41 kg) Rahr Pilsner malt and mash in with 5.5 quarts (5.2 L) of water to achieve a rest at 150 °F (66 °C). Let rest for 15 minutes, then raise to a boil and boil for 30 minutes. Let cool to 120–130 °F (49–54 °C) or add some cold strike water to cool.

Main mash: With the cereal mash, add an additional 3.25 gallons (12.3 L) of water and mash-in remaining malt, shooting for 122 °F (50 °C) for a protein rest. Rest for 15 minutes, then raise to 147 °F (64 °C) and hold for 60 minutes. Mash out at 170 °F (77 °C). Sparge with water acidified to pH 5.7 at 170 °F (77 °C) and collect 6.8 gallons (26 L) of wort. Boil for 30 minutes before adding the hops.

When the 90-minute boil is finished, cool wort to 50 °F (10 °C). This beer requires a healthy pitch of yeast. Aim for 1.25 million cells/mL/°P. Oxygenate or aerate well. Ferment at 50 °F (10 °C) until fermentation activity slows to a few bubbles per minute through the airlock. Let warm to 57 °F (14 °C) and hold for a few days. Slowly cool back to 50 °F (10 °C) and hold for a few more days. Cool the beer 3 °F/day (1.5 °C/day) to 38 °F (3.3 °C) and hold for 1–2 weeks to lager/condition. Keg and carbonate to 2.6 volumes of CO2.

Ingredients
4.5 lbs. (2 kg) Pilsen light dried malt extract
2.4 lbs. (1.1 kg) Sunny State Products Heritage Organic Blue Corn
0.75 lb. (0.34 kg) Pilsner malt
7 oz. (200 g) Weyermann pale wheat malt

Wyeast 2142 (Bohemian Lager), White Labs WLP830 (German Lager), or Mangrove Jack’s M84 (Bohemian Lager) yeast
¾ cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Follow the same instructions as the all-grain recipe for the cereal mash. The key difference is to only cool the cereal mash after the boil to 150–160 °F (66–71 °C) with some cool water. Add the pale wheat and Carahell® malts and hold for 30 minutes at this temperature. Separate the liquid from the grains and corn and collect into a boil kettle.

Add an additional 2 gallons (7.6 L) of water and raise to near-boiling temperature. Remove from the heat source, slowly stir in extract to ensure it is fully dissolved. Return to heat source and boil for 30 minutes before adding hops. Follow the remaining all-grain instructions for post-boil, fermentation, and packaging directions.

Tips For Success:
For brewers that have a hard time sourcing blue corn, flaked white maize can be substituted and added directly to the mash since it is pre-
gelatinized. And, one type of Pilsner malt will suffice if your homebrew store doesn’t source multiple Pilsner malt options. U.S. Saaz or additional Czech Saaz can be used in place of Motueka™. Finally, for an interesting twist, a Mexican lager yeast can be used in place of a traditional lager yeast. However, following the recipe and instructions above will get you the closest possible replication to the original Blue Corn Lager.

Tips for Success:

Conshohocken Brewing Co.’s Andrew Pope ("Keg Slinger"), Andrew Horne (Director of Brewing Operations), and Co-Founder Ken Buonocore very generously offered up this smooth, creamy, blonde "krapfen-style ale" (from the German word for "donuts") recipe that every brewer should attempt at least once. It is deceptively simple in its construction, but the flavors come through as clear as day. Clean bake shop notes abound, and the traditional brewing grains and yeast stay well out of the way. One important process note: Andrew says that "one of the batches might have been missing a donut or two . . ." and in consequence the conversion scaled down the 0.63 donuts to be added in the mash to a baseline half-donut, but you might consider adding more to increase your donut-perceivability (if you’re willing to forgo eating it for yourself).

Those who want to try this beer "live" can find it on special occasions at CBC’s Bridgeport Brew Pub in Bridgeport, Pennsylvania.

"Brewed slightly differently each year, but typically aged a minimum of eight months, these Barley Wines display a reddish-brown hue and exhibit prominent notes of ripe pit fruit, brown sugar, toffee, and a full-bodied, malty mouthfeel."

Ingredients

17 lbs. (7.7 kg) Maris Otter pale ale malt
1.25 lbs. (0.57 kg) British carastan malt (34 °L)
13 oz. (0.37 kg) Belgian Special B malt (120 °L)
5.7 AAU Glacier hop pellets (60 min.)
(1 oz./28 g at 5.7% alpha acids)
5.7 AAU Glacier hop pellets (40 min.) (1 oz./28 g at 5.7% alpha acids)
3.6 AAU East Kent Golding hop pellets (20 min.) (0.75 oz./21 g at 4.75% alpha acids)
2.4 AAU East Kent Golding hop pellets (5 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 4.75% alpha acids)
2 lbs. (0.91 kg) clover honey (10 min.)
1⁄2 tsp. Irish moss (30 min.)
1⁄2 tsp. yeast nutrient (15 min.)
White Labs WLP001 (California Ale) or Wyeast 1056 (American Ale) yeast or Safale US-05 yeast
3⁄4 cup (150 g) dextrose (if priming)

Step by Step

Mix all of the crushed grains with 6.7 gallons (25 L) of 170 °F (77 °C) water to stabilize at 151 °F (66 °C). This is a medium-thin mash using 1.4 quarts. (1.3 L) of strike water per pound (0.45 kg) of grain. This is designed to help achieve maximum fermentability. The lower mash temperature also serves to create a more fermentable wort. Mash for 60 minutes then slowly sparge with 175 °F (79 °C) water.

Collect approximately 7.5 gallons (28 L) of wort runoff to boil for three hours. While you are boiling the wort, add the hops, Irish moss, yeast nutrient, and honey as the schedule indicates. After the boil is complete, cool the wort to 75 °F (24 °C) and transfer to your fermenter. Pitch the yeast and aerate the wort heavily. Allow the beer to cool to 68 °F (20 °C) and then hold at that temperature until fermentation is complete. Gently transfer to a carboy, avoiding any splashing to prevent aerating the beer. Allow the beer to condition for an additional week. Prime and bottle condition or keg and force carbonate to 2.2 volumes CO2. Allow the beer to age six more weeks (or longer) to fully develop the flavors.

Extract with grains option:

Substitute the pale ale malt in the all-grain recipe with 9.9 lbs. (4.5 kg) Muntons light malt extract (Maris Otter if possible), 9 oz. (0.25 kg) light dried malt extract, and 1.5 lbs. (0.68 kg) Maris Otter pale ale malt. Steep the milled grain in 2.5 gallons (9.5 L) of water at 151 °F (66 °C) for 30 minutes. Remove grains from the wort and rinse with 2 quarts (2 L) of hot water. Boil for 30 minutes. Add the liquid and dried malt extracts and boil for 60 more minutes. Follow the remaining portion of the all-grain recipe.

Stir in boiling water to mash out to 168 °F (76 °C). Recirculate wort until clear. Run off wort and begin sparging. Keep sparge water heated to the point that the grain bed temperature remains around 168 °F (76 °C). Collect 6 gallons (23 L) of wort. Bring wort to a boil. Once hot break forms, add hops and boil for 60 minutes. Add Irish moss with 15 minutes left in boil. Cool wort to 68 °F (20 °C), aerate and pitch yeast. Ferment at 68 °F (20 °C).

(5 gallons/19 L, partial mash)
OG = 1.048 FG = 1.010
IBU = 30 SRM = 13 ABV = 4.9%

Ingredients
2 lb. 11.33 oz. (1.2 kg) pale malt
12.75 oz. (0.36 kg) Munich malt
6.33 oz. (0.18 kg) Victory malt
1.5 oz. (43 g) chocolate malt
9.0 oz. (0.26 kg) light dried malt extract
3 lb. 10 oz. (1.6 kg) light liquid malt extract
1 tsp. Irish moss
8 AAU Northern Brewer hops (0.89 oz./25 g of 9% alpha acids)
Wyeast 1056 (American Ale) or White Labs WLP001 (California Ale) yeast (2 qt./~2 L yeast starter)
1 cup corn sugar (for priming)

Step by Step
Heat 5.5 qts. (5.2 L) of water to 163 °F (73 °C) and pour it into a 2-gallon (7.6-L) beverage cooler. Add crushed grains to a large steeping bag and slowly submerge in cooler. Open bag and stir grains with a large spoon. Note the level of water in the cooler after the grains are added. Let partial mash rest, starting at 152 °F (67 °C), for 45 minutes.

While mash is resting, bring 0.75 gallons (2.8 L) of water to a boil in your brewpot. Also, bring 5.5 qts. (5.2 L) of water to 180 °F (82 °C) in another pot. Open spigot on cooler and collect first wort. Add it to the boiling water in your brewpot. Begin heating this wort to a boil. Add 180 °F (82 °C) water to cooler until liquid level is the same as before. Stir grains and let sit for 5 minutes, then collect second wort and add it to your brewpot.

Add dried malt extract and bring wort to a boil. Add hops and boil for 60 minutes. Stir in liquid malt extract and Irish moss for final 15 minutes of the boil. Cool wort and transfer to fermenter. Add water to fermenter to make 5 gallons (19 L). Aerate, pitch yeast and let ferment at 68 °F (20 °C).

IBU = 30 SRM = 13 ABV = 4.9%

Ingredients
11.33 oz. (0.32 kg) domestic 2-row pale malt
12.75 oz. (0.36 kg) Munich malt
6.33 oz. (0.18 kg) Victory malt
1.5 oz. (43 g) chocolate malt
1 lb. 14 oz. (0.85 kg) light dried malt extract
3.3 lbs. (1.5 kg) light liquid malt extract
1 tsp. Irish moss
8 AAU Northern Brewer hops (0.89 oz./25 g of 9% alpha acids)
Wyeast 1056 (American Ale) or White Labs WLP001 (California Ale) yeast (2 qt./~2 L yeast starter)
1 cup corn sugar (for priming)

Step by Step
In a large kitchen pot, heat 3.0 qts. (2.8 L) of water to 163 °F (73 °C). Add crushed grains to a large steeping bag and steep them in this pot, at 152 °F (67 °C), for 45 minutes. While grains are steeping, heat 1.5 gallons (5.7 L) of water to a boil in your brewpot. Also, heat 1.5 qts. (1.4 L) of water to 170 °F (77 °C) in another kitchen pot. After steep, place a colander over your brewpot and lift grain bag into it. Pour the "grain tea" from the steeped grains through the bag (to strain out any floating bits), then rinse the bag with 1.5 qts. (1.4 L) of 170 °F (77 °C) water. Add dried malt extract to liquid mixture and bring to a boil. Add hops and boil your wort for 60 minutes. Stir in Irish moss for final 15 minutes of the boil. Stir in liquid malt extract at end of boil and let wort sit — with the lid on your brewpot — for 15 minutes before cooling. Cool wort and transfer to fermenter. Add water to fermenter to make 5 gallons (19 L). Aerate, pitch yeast and let ferment at 68 °F (20 °C).

Copper Clad Best Bitter
(5 gallons/19 L*, all-grain)
OG = 1.040 FG = 1.008
IBU = 29 SRM = 11 ABV = 4.1%

Every self-respecting cask ale pub in the UK will have a best bitter on the bar. This recipe uses Endeavour, a modern British hop variety, to provide a refreshing, light, and fruity character to this most traditional of ale styles.

*Please note that this recipe is for 5 gallons (19 L), as is standard for BYO. If you want to fill a pin-sized cask, I suggest increasing the quantities by 10%. If you want to fill a pressure barrel, increase the quantities by 20%

Ingredients
7.5 lbs. (3.4 kg) British pale ale malt
8 oz. (230 g) medium crystal malt (60 °L)
4 oz. (110 g) amber malt (27 °L)
1.4 oz. (40 g) chocolate malt (425 °L)
3.7 AAU Challenger hops (60 min.) (0.4 oz./12 g at 9% alpha acids)
1.5 AAU Endeavour hops (30 min.) (0.15 oz./4.3 at 9.8% alpha acids)
11.4 AAU Endeavour hops (5 min.) (1.2 oz./33 at 9.8% alpha acids)
1⁄2 tsp. (0.6 g) Irish moss
Silica sol
7.2 fl. oz. (213 mL) isinglass (optional)
SafAle S-04 or your favorite English ale yeast
0.9 oz. (25 g) sugar

Step by step
Mash all of the malts at 150 °F (65.5 °C) for one hour. Collect ~6 gallons (23 L) of wort in the kettle and boil for one hour, adding the Challenger hops as soon as it starts boiling. After 30 minutes, add the first (and smaller) lot of Endeavour hops, then the Irish moss after a further 15 minutes. Add the final lot of Endeavour hops 5 minutes before the end of the boil.

At the end of the boil chill to 68 °F (20 °C) and then transfer to your fermenter. Aerate well and pitch the yeast. After five days, add the silica sol fining according to the manufacturer’s instructions and then chill to 41 °F (5 °C) or below for two days. If filling a single container (e.g. a pin cask or pressure barrel), dissolve the sugar in the smallest amount of boiled water
as you can, add this to the container and then rack the beer onto it. Add
the isinglass (if using for the purpose of clarification) directly to the container while the beer is being racked. Seal the container and condition at 68 °F (20 °C) for at least two weeks before serving.

Ingredients
5 lbs. (2.3 kg) Maris Otter liquid malt extract
8 oz. (230 g) medium crystal malt (60 °L)
1.4 oz. (40 g) chocolate malt (425 °L)
3.7 AAU Challenger hops (60 min.) (0.4 oz./12 g at 9% alpha acids)
1.5 AAU Endeavour hops (30 min.) (0.15 oz./4.3 at 9.8% alpha acids)
11.4 AAU Endeavour hops (5 min.) (1.2 oz./33 at 9.8% alpha acids)
1⁄2 tsp. (0.6 g) Irish moss
Silica sol
7.2 fl. oz. (213 mL) isinglass (optional)
SafAle S-04 or your favorite English ale yeast
0.9 oz. (25 g) sugar

Step by step
Place caramel and chocolate malt into a steeping bag and submerge in 6 gallons (23 L) of water at or near 155 °F (68 °C). After 20 minutes of steeping, remove the grain bag, then bring the wort up to a boil. When boil is achieved, take the kettle off the flame and add the extract while stirring. Once extract is fully dissolved return to the heat source and boil for 60 minutes, adding the hops as indicated in the recipe.

At the end of the boil, chill to 68 °F (20 °C) and then transfer to your fermenter and pitch the yeast. After five days, add the silica sol fining according to the manufacturer’s instructions and then chill to 41 °F (5 °C) or below for two days. If filling a single container (e.g. a pin cask or pressure barrel), dissolve the sugar in the smallest amount of boiled water as you can, add this to the container and then rack the beer onto it. Add the isinglass (if using for the purpose of clarification) directly to the container while the beer is being racked. Seal the container and condition at 68 °F (20 °C) for at least two weeks before serving.

Tips for success:
Anyone who is vegan will want to know that isinglass is obtained from bladders of fish. Sadly, isinglass is pretty essential if people want their beer to be crystal clear in 24 hours. As much as I wish silica sol could do this on its own, experience tells me that it simply doesn’t (I’m actually vegan and have spent the last three years trying to find a good way of replacing isinglass in casks and so far I have failed). The addition of isinglass is optional but not using it may result in hazy beer.

4 AAU Saaz hops (30 min.) (1 oz./28 g at 4% alpha acids)
White Labs WLP530 (Abbey Ale) or Wyeast 1214 (Belgian Abbey Style Ale) or Fermentis BE-256 yeast
3/4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step:
Heat 8 quarts (7.6 L) water to 163 °F (73 °C). Crush grains and add to a large grain bag. Submerge in the liquor, making sure the grains gets stirred enough that there are no dough balls. Hold mash at 152 °F (67 °C) for 90 minutes. Wash grains with 12 quarts (11 L) of 170 °F (88 °C) water. Add DME, stir well, bring to a boil. Add Styrian Goldings hops, boil 60 minutes. Add Saaz hops, boil 30 minutes. Remove from heat. Add to fermenter along with enough pre-boiled and chilled water to make up 5.25 gallons (20 L). Cool to 70 °F (21 °C), pitch yeast. Ferment at 68 °F (20 °C) for two weeks, rack to secondary and condition cool (50 °F/10 °C) for three to four weeks. Keg and force carbonate or prime with corn sugar, bottle and age three to four weeks at 45-50 °F (8-10 °C). Serve in a tall, fluted, stemmed glass.

All-grain option:
Replace the DME with another 8.5 lbs. (3.9 kg) pale malt and 1 lb. (0.45 kg) medium caramel malt (60° L). Increase mash water to 16 quarts (15.1 L) and sparge water to 20 quarts (19 L). Mash time and temperatures will be the same. Proceed as above from boiling.

All-extract option:
Omit pale malt. Steep caramel, Special B and kiln-coffee as above in 3 gallons (11 L) at 150 °F (66 °C) for 30 minutes. Remove grains. Increase DME to 7.25 lbs. (3.3 kg), and proceed as above from boiling.

IBU = 45 SRM= 15 ABV= 4.9%

I currently use Best Malz Pilsen and Munich. The aromatic malt is a product of Briess Malt. The CaraMunich® and Carafa® Special are products of Weyermann. Feel free to substitute any high-quality malt of the same type and color from a different supplier. My hops are in pellet form and come from Hop Union, Willamette Valley, or Hopsteiner.

Ingredients
7.3 lbs. (3.3 kg) continental Pilsner malt (2 °L)
1.8 lbs. (0.8 kg) Munich malt (8 °L)
14.1 oz. (0.4 kg) Briess Aromatic® (Munich) malt (20 °L)
7.1 oz. (0.2 kg) Weyermann Caramunich® III (57 °L)
2.6 oz. (75 g) Weyermann Carafa® Special II (430 °L)
8.75 AAU Magnum hops (60 min.) (0.67 oz./19 g at 13% alpha acids
1.7 AAU Tettnanger hops (15 min.) (0.42 oz./12 g at 4% alpha acids
1 tsp Irish moss
White Labs WLP036 (Düsseldorf Alt) or Wyeast 1007 (German Ale)
3/4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Mill the grains and dough-in targeting a mash of around 1.5 quarts of water (1.4 L) to 1 pound (0.45 kg) of grain (a liquor-to-grist ratio of about 3:1 by weight) and a temperature of 149 °F (65 °C). Hold the mash at 149 °F (65 °C) until enzymatic conversion is complete. Infuse the mash with near- boiling water while stirring or with a recirculating mash system raise the temperature to mash out at 168 °F (76 °C). Sparge slowly with 170 °F (77 °C) water, collecting wort until the pre-boil kettle volume is around 6.5 gallons (25 L) and the gravity is 1.039.

The total wort boil time is 90 minutes, which helps reduce the S-methyl methionine (SMM) present in the lightly kilned Pilsner malt and results in less dimethyl sulfide (DMS) in the finished beer. Add the first hop addition with 60 minutes remaining in the boil. Add Irish moss or other kettle finings and the second hop addition with 15 minutes left in the boil. Chill the wort to 60 °F (16 °C) and aerate thoroughly and pitch the yeast. I pitch 50% more yeast for altbier fermentation than I do for most ales. The proper pitch rate is around 230 billion cells, which is approximately two packages of liquid yeast or one package of liquid yeast in a 2.7 liter starter.

Let the beer slowly warm over the first 36 hours to 63-65 °F (17-18 °C) and then hold at this temperature for the remainder of fermentation. If fermentation seems sluggish at all after the first 24 hours, I am not afraid to raise the temperature a couple degrees more. With healthy yeast, fermentation should be complete around 7 to 10 days, but do not rush it. Cold fermented beers take longer to finish than ales or lagers fermented at warmer temperatures. If desired, perform a diacetyl rest during the last few days of active fermentation. Rack to a keg and force carbonate or rack to a bottling bucket, add priming sugar, and bottle. Target a carbonation level of 2 to 2.5 volumes. A month or more of cold conditioning at near-freezing temperatures will improve the beer.

I have used a number of Munich blend extracts. Most should do an admirable job of brewing an altbier. Always choose the freshest extract that fits the beer style. If you cannot get fresh liquid malt extract, use an appropriate amount of dry extract instead. CaraMunich® and Carafa® Special are products of Weyermann. Feel free to substitute any high-quality malt
of the same type and color from a different supplier.

Ingredients
6.8 lbs. (3.1 kg) Munich blend liquid malt extract (LME) (6 °L)
7.1 oz. (0.2 kg) Weyermann Caramunich® III (57 °L)
2.6 oz. (75 g) Weyermann Carafa® Special II (430 °L)
8.75 AAU Magnum hops (60 min.) (0.67 oz./19 g at 13% alpha acids
1.68 AAU Tettnanger hops (15 min.) (0.42 oz./12 g at 4% alpha acids
1 tsp. Irish moss
White Labs WLP036 (Düsseldorf Alt) or Wyeast 1007 (German Ale)
3/4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Add enough water to the malt extract to make a pre-boil volume of 5.9 gallons (22.3 liters) and a gravity of 1.043. Stir thoroughly to help dissolve the extract and bring to a boil.
Once the wort is boiling, add the bittering hops. The total wort boil time is one hour after adding the first hops. Add Irish moss or other kettle finings and the second hop addition with 15 minutes left in the boil. Chill the wort to 60 °F (16 °C) and aerate thoroughly. Then pitch the yeast. I pitch 50% more yeast for altbier fermentation than I do for most ales. The proper pitch rate is around 230 billion cells, which is approximately two packages of liquid yeast or one package of liquid yeast in a 2.7 liter starter.

Let the beer slowly warm over the first 36 hours to 63-65 °F (17-18 °C) and then hold at this temperature for the remainder of fermentation.

Cranberry Cream Ale
Cranberry Cream Ale
(5 gallons/19 L, extract with grains)
OG = 1.054 FG = 1.012
IBU = 26 SRM = 4 ABV = 5.6%

Ingredients
5 lbs. (2.23 kg) extra light dried malt extract
0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) dextrine malt
0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) light crystal malt (20° L)
1 lb. (0.45 kg) rice syrup (or 0.75 lb./0.34 kg rice syrup solids)
4.5 AAU Liberty hop pellets (45 min.) (1 oz./28 g at 4.5% alpha acids)
6 AAU Cascade pellets (15 min.) (1 oz./28 g at 6% alpha acids)
4 lbs. (1.8 kg) frozen, whole cranberries
White Labs WLP080 (Cream Ale) or Safale US-05 or Wyeast 2112 (California Lager)
7/8 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
In 3 gals. (11 L) of cold water, steep dextrine and light crystal malt. Raise temperature slowly to 170 °F (77 °C), then remove grains. Add to kettle dry malt extract and rice syrup (or rice syrup solids). Bring to a boil. Add Liberty hops and boil 30 minutes. Add Cascade hops and boil 15 minutes. Remove from heat, chill, and add to primary fermenter with enough pre-boiled cold water to make up 5.25 gals (20 L).

At 75 °F (24 °C), pitch a neutral ale yeast or lager yeast that does well at warmer temperatures. Ferment on the cooler side of ale temperatures (60 to 65 °F/16 to 18 °C).

After initial fermentation has slowed down, rack into a secondary onto whole cranberries (frozen for at least a week, let thaw and bruise them to break skins before placing them in the fermenter). Some new fermentation will probably begin, so you may find you need to use a blow-off setup for a day or so. Condition at fermentation temperature for about two weeks, then rack into a keg or bottling bucket. Bottle, priming with dextrose. Bottle condition three weeks and serve chilled.

Notes and Alternatives:

All-grain brewers:

This is a standard light, golden ale recipe, somewhere in the neighborhood of 9 lbs. (4.1 kg) brewers' malt while maintaining the same level of specialty grains, as above, with 0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) dextrine and 0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) light crystal. Keep it light.

Cranberries:

If you really get stuck and can't find cranberries, do not use a bottled cranberry juice cocktail or similar juice as a substitute. Most of them are blends of cranberry, apple, and white grape juice and will not produce the desired tartness. Pure (preferably organic) cranberry juice may be used in a pinch, but it is almost as hard to find sometimes as the berries themselves. Some of the wine-making trade suppliers sell a cranberry flavoring essence. Ask your homebrew supply store if it carries an essence or can find one. I have used one of them and was pleased with the results, although the fresh fruit will always be a better choice, to my mind.

Fining:

If you decide that the fruit treatment described above is not sanitary enough for you and you decide to pasteurize the fruit, be careful not to boil it because cranberries contain pectin and will turn your beer hazy given the opportunity. But if this happens, you can certainly use whatever finings you would normally use in the secondary.

(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.052 FG = 1.012
IBU = 25 SRM = 11 ABV = 5.3%

This amber ale is somewhat of a hybrid between a hops-forward American pale ale with a big-time floral nose and flavor, and a roasty/malty American brown ale.

Ingredients
7 lbs. (3.2 kg) 2-row pale malt
1.5 lbs. (0.7 kg) light Munich malt
1.25 lbs. (0.6 kg) torrified wheat
0.75 lb. (0.34 kg) crystal malt (60 °L)
0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) biscuit malt
1 oz. (28 g) chocolate malt
12 AAU Cascade hops (10 min.) (1.5 oz./43 g at 8% alpha acids)
12 AAU Cascade hops (5 min.) (1.5 oz./43 g at 8% alpha acids)
Wyeast 1056 (American Ale) or White Labs WLP001 (California Ale) or Safale US-05 yeast
2⁄3 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Mill the grains and mix with 3.6 gallons (13.6 L) of 165 °F (74 °C) strike water to reach a mash temperature of 154 °F (68 °C). Hold this temperature for 60 minutes. Vorlauf until your runnings are clear, and then lauter. Sparge the grains with 3.6 gallons (13.6 L) of 170 °F (77 °C) water and top up as necessary to obtain 6 gallons (23 L) of wort. Boil for 60 minutes, adding hops according to the ingredient list and Irish moss if desired.

After the boil, chill the wort to slightly below fermentation temperature, about 65 °F (18 °C). Aerate the wort with pure oxygen or filtered air and pitch yeast. Ferment at 66 °F (19 °C) until the completion of primary fermentation. Once the beer completes fermentation, reduce temperature to 32 °F (0 °C), then bottle or keg the beer and carbonate to approximately 2.25 volumes.

IBU = 25 SRM = 11 ABV = 5.2%

Ingredients
4.5 lbs. (2 kg) pale liquid malt extract
1.5 lbs. (0.7 kg) light Munich malt
1.25 lbs. (0.6 kg) torrified wheat
0.75 lb. (0.34 kg) crystal malt (60 °L)
0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) biscuit malt
1 oz. (28 g) chocolate malt
12 AAU Cascade hops (10 min.) (1.5 oz./43 g at 8% alpha acids)
12 AAU Cascade hops (5 min.) (1.5 oz./43 g at 8% alpha acids)
Wyeast 1056 (American Ale) or White Labs WLP001 (California Ale) or Safale US-05 yeast
2⁄3 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Place the crushed grains into one large, or several smaller, grain bags. Bring 1.3 gallons (5 L) of water to approximately 165 °F (74 °C) then submerge all the grains into the water. The mash temperature should stabilize at 154 °F (68 °C) and hold there for 60 minutes. Remove the grain bags, and let drain fully. Add liquid extract while stirring, and top up as necessary to obtain 6 gallons (23 L) of wort. Stir until the liquid extract is completely dissolved before adding heat to the kettle. Bring the wort to a boil. Boil for 60 minutes, adding hops according to the ingredient list and Irish moss as desired.

After the boil, chill the wort to slightly below fermentation temperature, about 65 °F (18 °C). Aerate the wort with pure oxygen or filtered air and pitch yeast. Ferment at 66 °F (19 °C) until the completion of primary fermentation. Once the beer completes fermentation, reduce temperature to 32 °F (0 °C), then bottle or keg the beer and carbonate to approximately 2.25 volumes.

Tips for Success:
As Rion noted in his letter, this beer has a profoundly prominent floral hops nose, for which you can thank its big time late-hopping regimen! All 25 IBUs come thanks to the aroma hops additions, but don’t let the hops take over the beer. John Allshouse, Senior Technical Advisor at Crazy Mountain Brewing Co., notes that homebreweries often lack the efficiency of commercial systems and that your beer may be lighter in color and lack some malt character. I’ve made some adjustments here to help you minimize that, but if you find that your version lacks the wonderful malt balance that Crazy Mountain celebrates, then feel free to bump up the character malt additions accordingly!

(5 gallons/19 L, partial mash)
OG = 1.046 FG = 1.012
IBU = 23 SRM = 5 ABV = 4.5%

Ingredients
1 lb. 2 oz. (0.51 kg) Coopers Light dried malt extract
4.0 lbs. (1.8 kg) Weyermann Bavarian Pilsner liquid malt extract (late addition)
1 lb. 2 oz. (0.51 kg) Pilsner malt
8.0 oz. (0.23 kg) wheat malt
6.0 oz. (170 g) Weyermann acidulated malt
1 tsp. Irish moss
3.3 AAU Tettnang hops (60 min.) (0.94 oz./27 g of 3.5% alpha acids)
3.0 AAU Hallertau hops (60 min.s) (0.75 oz./21 g of 4% alpha acids)
Wyeast 2565 (Kölsch) or White Labs WLP029 (German Ale/Kölsch) yeast (1.5 qt./~1.5 L yeast starter)
7/8 cup corn sugar (for priming)

Step by Step
Place crushed grain in a nylon steeping bag. In a large kitchen pot, heat 3.0 qts. (2.8 L)of water to 165 °F (74 °C). Submerge grain bag in water and let steep at 154 °F (68 °C) for 45 minutes. (If the temperature drops below 150 °F (66 °C), heat to 154 °F (68 °C) again.) While grains are steeping, heat 1.5 qts. (~1.5 L) of water to 170 °F (77 °C) in a sauce pan. Also,begin heating 2 gallons (7.6 L) of water to a boil in your brewpot. When steeping is done, place a colander over your brewpot and lift the grain bag into it. Pour the "grain tea" through the bag (which will strain out most of the grain bits), then rinse the bag with the 1.5 qts. (~1.5 L) of 170 °F (77 °C) water.

Heat the (roughly) 3 gallons (11 L) of wort in your brewpot to a boil, then stir in dried malt extract. (It will foam a bit, so don’t pour all the extract in at once.) Bring the wort back to a boil, add the two hops and boil for 60 minutes. Add Irish moss with 15 minutes left in boil. Add liquid malt extract at the end of the boil, put a lid on the brewpot and let wort steep for 15 minutes before cooling.

After the steep, cool the wort (either in a cold-water bath in your sink or with a wort chiller). Cool until the side of the brewpot feels cool to the touch. Transfer wort to your fermenter and top up to 5 gallons (19 L) with cool water. Aerate the wort and pitch your yeast. Ferment at 65 °F (18 °F). When fermentation slows to halt, rack to secondary. Bottle with corn sugar (or keg) one week later. If possible, store beer cold (around 40 °F/4.4 °C) after bottle conditioning for 2 weeks.

7venth Sun Brewery's Saison in Paradise Clone
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.050 FG = 1.005
IBU = 45 SRM = 3 ABV = 5.9%

A modern take on a classic French saison with an addition of grains of paradise to provide additional citrus and peppery spice notes.

Ingredients
8 lbs. (3.6 kg) German Pilsner malt
1.5 lbs. (0.68 kg) German wheat malt
8 oz. (230 g) flaked corn
3.2 AAU Saaz hops (60 min.) (0.9 oz./26 g at 3.5% alpha acids)
4.5 AAU East Kent Goldings hops (60 min.) (0.9 oz./26 g at 5% alpha acids)
4.9 AAU Saaz hops (3 min.) (1.4 oz./39 g at 3.5% alpha acids)
7 AAU East Kent Goldings hops (3 min.) (1.4 oz./39 g at 5% alpha acids)
1 g yeast nutrient (10 min.)
1 Whirlfloc tablet (10 min.)
0.69 g grains of paradise (5 min.)
Wyeast 3711 (French Saison), White Labs WLP590 (French Saison Ale), or LalBrew Belle Saison yeast
¾ cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
With a mash thickness of 1.75 qts./lb. (3.7 L/kg), heat 4.15 gallons (16.6 qts., 15.7 L) to achieve a stable mash temperature of 145 °F (63 °C). Hold at this temperature for 60 minutes or until complete. If using reverse osmosis or very soft water, add 1 tsp. of gypsum to the mash. When mash is complete, raise temperature to 168 °F (76 °C) for mash out, recirculate, and prepare for sparge.

With sparge water at 170 °F (77 °C) and as close to 5.2 pH as possible, collect about 6.5 gallons (24.6 L) of wort then raise to boil. Boil for 60 minutes, adding bittering hops at beginning of boil. Add a yeast nutrient and/or a clarifier such as Whirlfloc or Irish moss, spices, and the final hop additions per the ingredients list. Whirlpool at knockout, let wort sit for about 20 minutes.

Upon completion of whirlpool, chill as quickly as possible to 65 °F (18 °C), pitch yeast, and aerate. Allowing the beer to free rise is fine as the optimum fermentation range is 65 °F to 77 °F (18 to 25 °C). Exceeding this range usually has little negative impact on the final product, so you have a lot of flexibility with fermentation temperature as long as it ramps up relatively slowly. Fermentation should be fully complete in two weeks. If you want to achieve further clarity, chill before kegging or bottling. Carbonate to 2.65 v/v or bottle condition.

7venth Sun Brewery’s Saison In Paradise clone
(5 gallons/19 L, extract only)
OG = 1.050 FG = 1.005
IBU = 45 SRM = 3 ABV = 5.9%

Ingredients
4 lbs. (1.8 kg) Pilsen dried malt extract
1.7 lbs. (0.77 kg) wheat dried malt extract
3.2 AAU Saaz hops (60 min.) (0.9 oz./26 g at 3.5% alpha acids)
4.5 AAU East Kent Goldings hops (60 min.) (0.9 oz./26 g at 5% alpha acids)
4.9 AAU Saaz hops (3 min.) (1.4 oz./39 g at 3.5% alpha acids)
7 AAU East Kent Goldings hops (3 min.) (1.4 oz./39 g at 5% alpha acids)
1 g yeast nutrient (10 min.)
1 Whirlfloc tablet (10 min.)
0.69 g grains of paradise (5 min.)
Wyeast 3711 (French Saison), White Labs WLP590 (French Saison Ale), or LalBrew Belle Saison yeast
¾ cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Raise 3 gallons (11.36 L) of water to near boiling temperatures, then slowly stir in half of each of the extracts. Return to the heat source and raise to boil. Boil for 60 minutes, adding bittering hops at the beginning, Whirlfloc/Irish moss (if desired) at 10 minutes remaining, the rest of the extract (slowly) and spices at 5 minutes, and the final hop additions with 3 minutes remaining. Upon completion of the boil, whirlpool, then let wort sit for about 20 minutes.

Meanwhile, boil and chill about 2.5 gallons (9.46 L) of water so you can "top up" your wort later.
Upon completion of whirlpool, chill wort quickly to 65 °F (18 °C). Add pre-boiled and chilled water to top up to 5 gallons (19 L). (Ideally, your chilled water is also 65 °F/18 °C.) Pitch yeast and aerate if using a liquid yeast strain. Follow the all-grain instructions for fermentation and packaging instructions.

Tips For Success:
7venth Sun Brewery employs a 60-minute boil. Since the majority of the base malt is a Pilsner malt, feel free to extend the boil to 90 minutes if you choose to drive off DMS (dimethyl sulfide) precursors. Just be sure to account for the extra boil volume loss if doing so.

Remember, brewing spices go a long way. It is better to be conservative than to overdo it. You can always add more, but you can’t undo an overspiced batch.

Making a yeast starter will ensure you have enough healthy and vibrant yeast to fully ferment this dry saison when using a liquid strain.

Saisons have a lot of leeway regarding fermentation temperature. The key is not letting it free rise too fast. Ideally, you want to be in the optimum fermentation temperature range during the important primary fermentation stage. Exceeding this temperature after primary is over rarely negatively impacts this forgiving beer style.

Step by Step
Use soft or low mineral content water to help accentuate the malty aspects of this beer. With a 1.2 qts./lb. (2.5 L/kg) water-to-grist ratio, target a mash temperature of 155 °F (68 °C). Perform a single infusion mash for 60 minutes or until proper enzymatic conversion has occurred. Sparge with 170 °F (76 °C) water to collect 8.4 gallons (31.8 L) of wort.

Boil for 120 minutes, adding hops and fining agents as indicated. At flameout, rapidly chill the wort to 61 °F (16 °C) and transfer to the primary fermenter. Aerate thoroughly and pitch plenty of healthy yeast. Ferment at 63 °F (17 °C) until terminal gravity of 1.018 is reached, usually within 10 to 14 days. Once fermentation is complete, drop beer temperature to 50 °F
(10 °C) and hold for 5 days. Then drop temperature to 39 °F (4 °C) and lager for a minimum of 3 weeks. Keg or bottle, targeting 2.2 volumes of CO2.

Tips for Success:
Use high quality, fresh malts along with sufficient aging time and low fermentation temperatures to develop the sweet, smooth, and balanced maltiness desired in this beer.

With no hops, homemade base malt, and recycled yeast, this beer is pretty rustic, but the wild herbs perfectly complement the grain bill to give a rich, earthy flavor. This brew uses a hybrid temperature step mash and cereal mash to get the most out of the home-malted corn.

Ingredients
6.3 lbs. (2.86 kg) popping corn
2 lbs. (0.91 kg) Munich malt
13 oz. (370 g) rye malt
10 oz. (285 g) medium crystal malt (60 °L)
0.6 oz. (17 g) dried ground ivy (60 min.)
1.3 oz. (37 g) dried mugwort (60 min.)
1–1.5 cups of SafAle S-04 yeast trub from a previous batch (or other yeast trub)
3⁄4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by step
You will need to malt the popping corn 8–10 days before brewing according to the instructions outlined in the Pantry Brew article, making about 5.7 lbs. (2.56 kg) of corn malt. 

On brew day, heat 1.75 gallons (6.7 L) of water to around 109–111 °F (43–44 °C) and stir in the crushed corn malt to achieve an initial mash temperature of around 104 °F (40 °C). Hold it at this temperature for 30 minutes. Then add 2 quarts (1.9 L) of boiling water to raise the mash temperature to around 122 °F (50 °C) and hold at this temperature for 30 minutes. Then drain off 1.5 gallons (5.7 L) of the mash liquid and store this in the fridge (you will need this later). Add 0.8 gallons (3 L) of boiling water to the mash to raise the temperature to around 152–154 °F (67–68 °C) and hold it at this temperature for 30 minutes. Add another gallon (3.8 L) of water and heat the mash to around 194 °F (90 °C), holding at this temperature for 30 minutes. Cool to 169 °F (76 °C), then add the other malts and the 1.5 gallons (5.7 L) of liquid from the fridge and reheat the mash to 151 °F (66 °C) and hold at this temperature for 2 hours. Sparge with 170 °F (77 °C) water to collect 6 gallons (23 L) of wort.

Boil the wort for 60 minutes, add-ing the mugwort and ground ivy at the start of the boil. At the end of the boil, remove the mugwort and ground ivy, then chill the wort to around 68 °F (20 °C) and aerate well before pitching the yeast. Ferment at 68 °F (20 °C) for 7 days, then chill to around 39 °F (4 °C), if possible, for two days. Rack to keg or bottles and either prime with the sugar or carbonate to around 2.0–2.5 volumes.

3/4 cup (150 g) dextrose (for priming)

Step by Step
Mash at 150 °F (66 °C) for 60 minutes. Vorlaf until your runnings are clear, sparge, and boil for 90 minutes, adding the hops at the times indicated in the ingredients list. After the boil, turn off the heat and chill the wort rapidly to 68 °F (20 C). Aerate the wort well, and pitch the yeast. Ferment at 68–70 °F (20–21 °C). Add the dry hops when the gravity has dropped to about 1.025. When final gravity is reached, bottle or keg as usual. Age two to three weeks before serving.

Extract with Grains Option: Omit the 2-row pale malt. Add 6.6 lbs. (3 kg) Muntons light liquid malt extract and 0.25 lb. (0.11 kg) Muntons light dried malt extract. Steep the grains in 3 gallons (11 L) of water at 150 °F (66 °C) for 30 minutes. Add the malt extracts and bring to a boil. Boil for 60 minutes, adding the hops at the times indicated in the ingredients list. After the boil, cool the wort, transfer to a sanitary fermenter, top off with cool water to 5.5 gallons (21 L), aerate well and pitch the yeast. Follow the remainder of the all-grain recipe.

This recipe represents the hybrid mild. Brewed using Nottingham yeast for its strong attenuation for the higher gravity. This beer has a strength more akin to heritage mild but incorporates the dark grains of a traditional mild.

Ingredients
9.5 lbs. (4.3 kg) mild malt
2 lbs. (0.91 kg) Maris Otter pale ale malt
12.5 oz. (354 g) crystal malt (150 °L)
4.6 oz. (130 g) chocolate malt
7.4 AAU Admiral hops (60 min.) (0.5 oz. at 14.75% alpha acids)
1 oz. (28 g) Fuggle hops (0 min.)
1 oz. (28 g) East Kent Golding hops (0 min.)
LalBrew Nottingham, White Labs WLP007 (Dry English Ale), or Wyeast 1098 (British Ale) yeast
1⁄3 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by step
Mash crushed grains at 151 °F (66 °C) for 60 minutes. Batch sparge for 15 minutes at 162 °F (72 °C). Collect 6.5 gallons (24.5 L) of wort in the brew kettle. Bring wort to boil for a standard 60-minute boil, adding hops as indicated in the ingredients list.

When the boil is complete, cool wort down to 65 °F (18 °C) and transfer to fermentation vessel. Add yeast as packet directs. Bottle conditioning mild is much more traditional than force carbonating in a keg, but either way mild is best served at lower carbonation levels. Aim for 1.5–2.0 volumes of carbonation.

Step by Step
Aim for 3:1 calcium chloride:calcium sulfate. For this sized batch, around 6 g:2 g (8 g total) will be ballpark, but this will depend on your water supply.

The recipe employs a single infusion mash. Mash at 151 °F (66 °C) for one hour before beginning your lautering process. Collect enough wort in your brew kettle for a 60-minute boil. Boil wort for 60 minutes, adding your first hop addition after 45 minutes and the second hop addition at flameout. Give the wort a long stir then let settle for 20 minutes. Add the third hop addition then begin chilling process.

Cool wort to 66 °F (19 °C), aerate the wort well (if using a liquid yeast strain), then pitch the yeast. Ferment at 68 °F (20 °C) until the gravity reaches 1.024 and then raise the temperature to 72 °F (22 °C).

Add first dry hop addition at 30% apparent attenuation (e.g. day 2 or 3 of fermentation). When the beer nears terminal gravity, more specifically an SG of 1.012, add the second dry hop addition. Add the third dry hop addition when the fermentation is finished and clean (no diacetyl). Chill 24 to 48 hours later, depending on taste. Feel free to add more hops to last dry hop addition if aroma is lacking.

After your usual cold conditioning process, bottle/keg and carbonate to 2.7 volumes of CO2.

CW Bohemian Pilsner
(5 gallons/19 L, extract with grains)
OG = 1.050 FG = 1.015
IBU = 28–46 SRM = 5+ ABV = 5.7%

Ingredients
6 lsb. (2.7 kg) extra light dried malt extract
1 lb. (0.45 kg) crystal malt (10 °L)
10 AAU Hallertau Tradition hops (60 min.) (1.0 oz./28 g of 10% alpha acids)
3.1 AAU Czech Saaz hops (30 min.) (1.0 oz./28 g of 3.1% alpha acids)
3.1 AAU Czech Saaz hops (20 min.) (1.0 oz./28 g of 3.1% alpha acids)
3.1 AAU Czech Saaz hops (5 min.) (1.0 oz./28 g of 3.1% alpha acids)
1 tsp. Irish moss
White Labs WLP800 (Pilsner Lager), White Labs WLP820 Oktoberfest Lager), White Labs WLP830 (German Lager) or Superior Lager yeast
3/4 cup corn sugar (for priming)

Step by step
Measure 3 gallons (11 L) of water and place in the refrigerator overnight, making sure one gallon (3.8 L) of the three is distilled water. Measure 1 gallon (3.8 L) of distilled water and 0.5–1 gallon (2–3.8 L) of tap or spring water into your boiling pot. Heat to 150 °F (66 °C). Turn off the heat and add the crystal malt in a straining bag. Let the grains steep for 20 minutes. After 20 minutes, remove and discard the grain bag and grains.

Bring the water to a boil. Once the wort begins to boil, add the dried malt extract. Stir thoroughly. When the wort comes to a boil again, add the first hop addition for bittering (Hallertau Tradition). Adjust heat so the wort does not rise to the top of the kettle and overflow. Stir occasionally to avoid scorching. Add flavoring hops 30 and 40 minutes into the boil. Add Irish moss at 30–45 minute into the boil. Add the final addition of hops, for aroma when you are 55 minutes into the boil (the last 5 minutes). (Total boiling time is 60 minutes.)

Place the covered pot in a cold-water bath (approximately 30 minutes) to force-cool the wort to 120 °F (49 °C). Pour the wort into your fermenter. You may wish to use a strainer to remove the hops. Add the cold water from fridge to make 5 gallons (19 L). Stir well. When wort is between 70–75 °F (21–24 °C), stir vigorously for 60 seconds. Pitch (add) the yeast culture or the hydrated yeast into the wort. Stir again.

Put the potential "liquid gold" in a warm place (65–75 °F/18–24 °C). Fermentation will last about 5-10 days, depending on the temperature. If you are going to ferment at lager temperature (50–60 °F/10–16 °C), start fermentation at room temperature, once fermentation has commenced movement of air through the airlock, slowly lower the temperature, not more than 2–4 °F (1–2 °C) per day, until your desired temperature is reached. If fermenting at lager temperatures, fermentation may take 2–4 weeks. You will also want to bring the beer up to room temperature for 1–3 days before bottling.

Siphon beer into a clean and sterile bottling bucket. Prime with 3/4 cup corn sugar boiled in saucepan with 1/2 cup water or beer and bottle. Allow beer to age upright at room temperature for at least 15 days until carbonation has formed. Now move it to a cooler temperature (30–35 °F/1–1.7 °C) for further aging. You may wish to taste it at this time but peak flavor is reached after four weeks of additional aging. Enjoy!

Cyserale
Cyserale
(5 gallons/19 L, partial mash)
OG = 1.055 FG = 1.010
IBU = 28 SRM = 8 ABV = 6%

Ingredients
2 lbs. (0.91 kg) pale malt
0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) light crystal malt (35° L)
0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) malted wheat
3 lbs. (1.5 kg) light liquid malt extract
1 lb. (0.45 kg) light wildflower honey
1.5 gal. (7.6 L) fresh non-preserved, non-sulfited apple juice or sweet cider
6 AAU Tettnanger hops (75 min.) (1.2 oz./34 g at 5% alpha acids)
3 AAU Cascade hops (15 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 6% alpha acids)
German ale yeast slurry (such as a Kölsch strain)
7/8 cup corn sugar for priming

Step by Step
Heat 1.25 gal. water to 160 °F (71 °C), mix in crushed grains, and hold at 150 °F (66 °C) for 90 min. Sparge with 2 gal. of 168 °F (76 °C) water. Add enough water to make at least 3 gal. (11 L) total volume in kettle. Stir in malt extract and honey, bring to a boil. Total boil is 75 min. Add Tettnanger hops and boil 60 min. Add Cascade hops, boil 15 min., and remove from heat. Cool, add apple juice and enough water to make 5.25 gal (20 L). At 68 °F (20 °C), pitch yeast slurry.

Ferment at 62 to 65 °F (17 to 18 °C) for three weeks, then rack to secondary. Condition at 60 °F (16 °C) for four to six weeks. Prime with corn sugar and bottle or keg and force carbonate

Notes:
Temperature: The temperatures in the recipe are warm enough to ferment the honey relatively quickly, yet cool enough to prevent the apple juice from becoming acetic.

Apple juice vs. cider: It doesn’t really matter whether you use apple juice or cider as long as it tastes sweet. If you’re buying pre-pressed juice, be very careful to avoid anything that is preserved or sulfited (use only pure apple juice). I prefer to press my own apples because I can pick and choose the variety of apples and be absolutely certain there are no additives. Depending on how early in the season you brew this ale, however, it may not be possible to find fresh local juice. Seek out a good, all-natural (even organic) canned or bottled juice. This would be an interesting brew to try with pear cider. If the apple juice is not pasteurized, you can pasteurize the juice by bringing it to 175 °F (80 °C) for 15 min. before adding it to wort.

Extract with grains option:
Omit the pale malt, increase the malt extract to 5 lbs. (2.3 kg), and start by steeping the crystal malts in 3 gal. (11 L) of 150 °F (66 °C) water for 30 min. Remove grains and continue with the addition of the extract.

All-grain:
Omit the malt extract and increase the pale malt to 6.5 lbs. (3 kg). Mash in 2.5 gal. (9.4 L), sparge with 3.25 gal. (12.3 L) (same times and temperatures), and proceed as above. The goal is to finish with 3.75 gallons (14.2 L) in your kettle at the end of the boil. You may need to add water to the kettle to make 5.25 gal. (20 L) in the end.

Cyser Apple Honey Mead
(5 gallons/19 L)
OG = 1.095 FG = 0.995
ABV = 14%

Ingredients
4 gal. (15 L) apple cider or juice (with no preservatives)
10 lbs. (4.5 kg) honey (favorite variety)
3 tsp. liquid pectic enzyme
3 tsp. yeast nutrient
3 tsp. malic acid
3 tsp. potassium sorbate
1 packet champagne yeast
250 ml wine conditioner (optional)

Step By Step
In large, non-reactive kettle heat the honey with cider/juice. The ratio should be one part honey to two parts cider. Bring temperature to 175 °F (80 °C) and hold for 15 minutes.

Add the remaining apple cider/juice to the solution and top off with water to 5 gallons (19 L). Stir thoroughly. Add the malic acid to your primary fermenter (a seven-gallon plastic fermenter with a lid and airlock works well) and mix well. Add the pectic enzyme and yeast nutrient mixing well. The specific gravity should be around 1.095.

Disperse the yeast in 4 oz. (113 mL) warm water. Let stand for 10 to 15 minutes. Pitch the yeast and place the fermenter in a warm place (70 to 78°F/21 to 26 °C). Monitor the sugar level (specific gravity) to check for fermentation progression by using a hydrometer about every other day. When specific gravity has reached about 1.020, siphon this liquid into a clean, five-gallon (19 L) carboy and top up with cold, pre-boiled water if necessary. Top with a bung and fermentation lock. The fermentation will continue to progress slowly at this point, often taking a number of weeks to finish.

After three more weeks, or when the specific gravity reaches around 0.995, rack into another clean carboy. At this specific gravity reading, your mead will be dry. Top up with cold, preboiled water.

After another week, check the titratable acidity (in grams per liter) of your mead. If it is much below 5 g/L or tastes flat, try adding an acid blend in order to bring the titratable acidity up to around 7 g/L.

At this point, if you have the equipment, you could filter the mead into a clean carboy. After the acid’s adjusted (and after you’ve filtered, if you did) add some postassium sorbate to prevent a re-fermentation in the bottle. Let the mead sit (bulk age) for one month.

After a month, if you wish to bottle your mead in homebrew or champagne bottles with crown caps, do so. Adding wine conditioner is an optional step that might improve the body and mouthfeel of the final cyser. If you decide to use a bit of wine conditioner, mix it thoroughly into the mead before you bottle it. Bottle-age your cyser for 5 months before consumption.

OG = 1.051 FG = 1.011
IBU = 26 SRM = 17 ABV = 5.4%

A smooth drinking Dunkel, brewed using The Brülosophy Method of fast lager fermentations

Ingredients
3.3 lbs. (1.5 kg) Pilsen liquid malt extract
3.3 lbs. (1.5 kg) Munich liquid malt extract
8 oz. (227 g) caramel Munich malt (80 °L)
2 oz. (57 g) Carafa® II malt (430 °L)
2 AAU Hallertau Tradition (first wort hop) (0.5 oz./14 g at 4% alpha acids)
5 AAU Hallertau Tradition (60 min.) (1.25 oz./35 g at 4% alpha acids)
1 Whirlfloc tablet (15 min.)
White Labs WLP833 (German Bock Lager) or Wyeast 2308 (Munich Lager) yeast
2/3 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Start heating 6 gallons (23 L) of water. Place crushed grains in a muslin bag and when the water reaches 160 °F (12 °C) turn off the heat and add the grain bag. Allow the grains to steep for 15 minutes then remove. Stir in all the liquid malt extract, stirring until all the extract is dissolved. Add the first wort hops, then begin heating to a boil. Boil for 60 minutes, adding hops and kettle fining according to the ingredients list. There should be 5 gallons (19 L) of wort in the kettle when finished with the boil.

After the boil, chill the wort to slightly below fermentation temperature, about 53 °F (12 °C). Aerate the wort with pure oxygen or filtered air, transfer to the fermenter and pitch yeast.

Ferment at 53 °F (12 °C) until gravity reaches 1.031, then begin raising the temperature about 5 °F (3 °C) every 12 hours until the fermenter reaches a temperature of 65 – 68 °F (18 - 20 °C). Hold at this temperature until terminal gravity has been reached. Wait an additional 2-3 days or until no signs of diacetyl or acetaldehyde are present. Begin slowly cooling the beer, dropping the temperature 5 – 8 °F (3 - 4 °C) every 12 hours until it reaches 32 °F (0 °C). Bottle or keg as normal.

Recipe by Petr Bachan • Minneapolis, Minnesota

Ingredients
7.5 lbs. (3.4 kg) German Pilsner malt
7 oz. (0.2 kg) Caravienne malt (22 °L)
6 oz. (0.17 kg) German wheat malt
5 oz. (0.14 g) German acidulated malt (sauermalz)
3 AAU Magnum hops (first wort hop) (0.25 oz./7 g at 12% alpha acids)
2 AAU Czech Saaz hops (30 min.) (0.75 oz./21 g at 2.6% alpha acids)
2.6 AAU Czech Saaz hops (10 min.) (1 oz./28 g at 2.6% alpha acids)
3.6 AAU Magnum hops (10 min.) (0.3 oz./9 g at 12% alpha acids)
1 oz. (28 g) Czech Saaz hops (0 min.)
Wyeast 2633 (Oktoberfest Lager Blend) yeast
3⁄4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
This recipe uses reverse osmosis (RO) water. The water salt treatments are minimal; add 5 g calcium chloride (CaCl2) to the mash and 3 g CaCl2 to the sparge water. The acidulated malt is used to reach the desired mash pH; do not omit this ingredient unless you acidify your mash water. Do not add additional water salts to lower the pH; a minerally water character is inappropriate for this style.

Two or three days before brew day, make a 2-qt. (2-L) yeast starter, aerating the wort thoroughly (preferably with oxygen) before pitching the yeast. On brew day, mash in at 156 °F (69 °C) in 14 qts. (13 L) of water and hold this temperature until converted, 30 to 45 minutes. Pull a thick decoction of at least half the mash, then boil the decoction until it changes color and consistency, about 25 minutes. Stir the decoction frequently to avoid scorching. Return the decoction to the main mash and hold at 168 °F (76 °C) for mash out. Recirculate until clear, fly sparge with 168 °F (76 °C) water until 6.5 gallons (25 L) of wort is collected.

Boil the wort for 90 minutes, adding the hops at times indicated in the recipe. First wort hops are added to the kettle before the wort is run off. After adding the final hops when the heat is turned off, immediately begin chilling the wort. Chill to 43–45 °F (6–7 °C). Chilling to this low temperature may take two cooling stages or the use of an ice bath to reduce the temperature of the cooling water.

Oxygenate, then pitch the yeast starter. Allow fermentation temperature to rise to no more than 50 °F (10 °C) until desired final gravity (FG) is achieved. Then rack and slowly chill to lagering temperature. Lager for 4 to 6 weeks at 33 °F (1 °C). Prime and bottle condition, or keg and force carbonate to 2.4 volumes.

The original recipe used Best Malz for the base malt, a fully modified malt. If using an undermodified malt (such as Weyermann Floor-Malted Bohemian Pilsner malt), a true double decoction mash schedule can be used as described in the article. If using the Weyermann malt, you can also substitute the Weyermann Carabohemian® malt for the Caravienne. These products are malted specifically for making Czech-style beers.

Czech Pale Lager
(5 gallons/19 L, extract with grain)
OG = 1.042 FG = 1.011
IBU = 29 SRM = 3.8 ABV = 4.1%

Ingredients
5.5 lbs. (2.5 kg) liquid Pilsner malt extract
4 oz. (0.11 kg) Caravienne malt
4 oz. (0.11 kg) German caramel wheat malt (45 °L)
3 AAU Magnum hops (60 min.) (0.25 oz./7 g at 12% alpha acids)
2 AAU Czech Saaz hops (30 min.) (0.75 oz./21 g at 2.6% alpha acids)
2.6 AAU Czech Saaz hops (10 min.) (1 oz./28 g at 2.6% alpha acids)
3.6 AAU Magnum hops (10 min.) (0.3 oz./9 g at 12% alpha acids)
1 oz. (28 g) Czech Saaz hops (0 min.)
Wyeast 2633 (Oktoberfest Lager Blend) yeast
3⁄4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Use 6 gallons (23 L) of RO water in the brew kettle; heat to 158 °F (70 °C). Add 3 g calcium chloride to the water. Place the Caravienne and caramel wheat malt in a mesh bag, and steep in the hot water for 30 minutes. Remove the mesh bag, then turn the heat off.

Add the liquid malt extract and stir thoroughly to dissolve the extract completely. You do not want to feel liquid extract at the bottom of the kettle when stirring with your spoon. Turn the heat back on and bring to a boil. Boil the wort for 60 minutes, adding the hops at the times indicated in the recipe.

After adding the final hops when the heat is turned off, immediately begin chilling the wort. Chill to 43– 45 °F (6–7 °C). Chilling to this low temperature may take two cooling stages or the use of an ice bath to reduce the temperature of the cooling water. Oxygenate the wort, then pitch the yeast starter. Allow the fermentation temperature to rise to no more than 50 °F (10 °C) until the desired FG is achieved. Taste the beer for diacetyl; if noticeable diacetyl is present, raise the temperature to 65 °F (18 °C) for two days. Rack and slowly chill to lagering temperature. Lager for 4 to 6 weeks at 33 °F (1 °C). Prime and bottle condition, or keg and force carbonate to 2.4 volumes.

2.6 AAU Czech Saaz hops (10 min.) (1 oz./28 g at 2.6% alpha acids)
3.6 AAU Magnum hops (10 min.) (0.3 oz./9 g at 12% alpha acids)
1 oz. (28 g) Czech Saaz hops (0 min.)
Wyeast 2633 (Oktoberfest Lager Blend) yeast
3⁄4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Use 6 gallons (23 L) of RO water in the brew kettle; heat to 158 °F (70 °C). Add 3 g calcium chloride to the water. Place the Caravienne and caramel wheat malt in a mesh bag, and steep in the hot water for 30 minutes. Remove the mesh bag, then turn the heat off.

Add the liquid malt extract and stir thoroughly to dissolve the extract completely. You do not want to feel liquid extract at the bottom of the kettle when stirring with your spoon. Turn the heat back on and bring to a boil. Boil the wort for 60 minutes, adding the hops at the times indicated in the recipe.

After adding the final hops when the heat is turned off, immediately begin chilling the wort. Chill to 43– 45 °F (6–7 °C). Chilling to this low temperature may take two cooling stages or the use of an ice bath to reduce the temperature of the cooling water. Oxygenate the wort, then pitch the yeast starter. Allow the fermentation temperature to rise to no more than 50 °F (10 °C) until the desired FG is achieved. Taste the beer for diacetyl; if noticeable diacetyl is present, raise the temperature to 65 °F (18 °C) for two days. Rack and slowly chill to lagering temperature. Lager for 4 to 6 weeks at 33 °F (1 °C). Prime and bottle condition, or keg and force carbonate to 2.4 volumes.

The deep red-garnet color from kettle soured this beer came to existence for a homebrew club Halloween-themed party. While the color could still be achieved with a less malty base grain, it is supposed to add to the fun of the beer. Be sure to go light on the cinnamon, you don’t want to overpower the fruit character . . . think more a berry jelly on toast with a crisp snap from the acidity and hint of cinnamon.

Ingredients
9 lbs. (4.1 kg) Best Malz Red X malt
1 lb. (0.45 kg) pale wheat malt
1 oz. (28 g) roasted barley (300 °L)
3 lbs. (1.4 kg) frozen raspberries
3 lbs. (1.4 kg) frozen strawberries
1⁄2 cinnamon stick (0 min.)
5 oz. (21 g) dried hibiscus flower (secondary)
1.3 AAU Cascade hops (60 min.) (0.2 oz./6 g at 6.5 % alpha acids)
1⁄2 tsp. yeast nutrient (10 min.)
2 Goodbelly StraightShots or 4 Swanson Probiotic L. plantarum capsules
White Labs WLP001 (California Ale) or Wyeast 1056 (American Ale) or SafAle US-05 yeast
3⁄4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Mill the grains and dough-in targeting a mash of around 1.5 quarts of water per pound of grain (3.1 L/kg) and a temperature of 150 °F (66 °C). Add lactic acid as needed to target a mash pH of 5.2. Hold the mash at 150 °F (66 °C) for 60 minutes. Sparge, or mash-out and lauter with enough water to yield a total volume of 5 gallons (19 L) of wort.

Heat wort to 180 °F (82 °C) in the brew kettle and hold for 8 minutes to pasteurize. Chill the wort to 95 °F (35 °C). Transfer the chilled wort to a sanitized, purged souring keg. Do not aerate. Add the Goodbelly shots or the inner contents of the Swanson capsules to the keg. Seal the keg and purge with CO2, leaving about 20 PSI of pressure in the headspace after purging.

Allow the L. plantarum to sour the wort for about 48 hours at 95 °F (35 °C), until the pH drops to about 3.5.

After souring, transfer the wort to a boil kettle and add the amount of distilled water expected to boil off over a 60-minute period. Bring to a boil and boil for 60 minutes, adding the hops, cinnamon, and yeast nutrient according to the ingredient list.

Turn off the heat and chill the wort to 68 °F (20 °C) or slightly cooler. Transfer the cooled wort to a "clean beer" fermenter, aerate, and pitch the yeast targeting about 200 billion cells. Ferment at 68 °F (20 °C) until gravity is a few points above terminal.

Thaw and crush the strawberries and raspberries and place in the bottom of secondary fermenter. Using 1 qt. (1 L) of water, make a hot tea with the dried hibiscus flower. Add the tea with flowers to the bottom of a secondary fermenter. Rack beer into the secondary on top of the strawberries, raspberries, and hibiscus tea. Ferment for about a week at 68 °F (20 °C), until the sugars in the fruit have fermented out.

If bottle conditioning, carbonate the beer to around 2.5 volumes of CO2. If kegging, carbonate as high as 3.5 volumes.

Beets are added to the extract version simply to replace the red hue contributed by the Red X malt in the all-grain version. You could add them before souring, but I added the beets to the boil instead to maximize color extraction.

Ingredients
4.2 lbs. (2.36 kg) extra light dried malt extract
1 lb. (0.45 kg) Munich dried malt extract
2 medium beets, processed (10 min.)
3 lbs. (1.4 kg) frozen raspberries
3 lbs. (1.4 kg) frozen strawberries
1⁄2 cinnamon stick (0 min.)
5 oz. (21 g) dried hibiscus flower (secondary)

White Labs WLP001 (California Ale) or Wyeast 1056 (American Ale) or SafAle US-05 yeast
3⁄4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Fill the brew kettle with 4.95 gallons (18.7 L) water. Heat to about 160 °F (71 °C). Turn off heat, add the extract, and stir to dissolve. Heat wort to 180 °F (82 °C) in the brew kettle and hold for 8 minutes to pasteurize.

Follow the souring instructions from the all-grain recipe. After souring, transfer the wort to a boil kettle and add the amount of distilled water expected to boil off over a 60-minute period. Boil for 60 minutes, adding the hops, beets, cinnamon, and yeast nutrient according to the ingredient list.

Turn off the heat and chill the wort to 68 °F (20 °C) or slightly cooler. Transfer the cooled wort to a "clean beer" fermenter, aerate, and pitch the yeast targeting about 200 billion cells. Ferment at 68 °F (20 °C) until gravity is a few points above terminal.

Follow the remainder of the all-grain instructions.

Step by Step
Start by milling your grain, hydrate with 3.2 gallons (12.2 L) water at around 163 °F (73 °F) to hit a mash temperature of 152 ºF (67 ºC). Let the mash rest for 15 to 30 minutes. (Take an iodine test if the thought of a shorter mash causes you concern.) Recirculate wort over grain for about 5 minutes until the wort clears. Run wort into kettle and sparge with 168–172 ºF (76–78 ºC) water until you reach volume on kettle.

Bring wort to boil and commence hop schedule: First hop addition at start of boil (90 min), second hop addition at 30 minutes left in boil and the third hop addition at end of boil. (Whirlpool, if possible, for 5 minutes). Rest for 5 minutes, then knock out into fermentation vessel. Cool to 68–70 ºF (~21 ºC) and pitch yeast.

Ferment at approximately 68 ºF (20 ºC) until brew reaches 3.8–4.2 ºPlato (~ SG 1.015–1.017). Rack off yeast and condition for 5 days. Add priming sugar or wort. Rack into bottles and let age at 40 ºF (~4 ºC) or cooler for two weeks. Pop a top and enjoy!

IBU = 24 SRM = 23 ABV = 8.3%

Saisons are traditionally a warm weather drink, but a few of us have a tradition of getting together each fall to brew a strong, dark, spiced saison. Each year’s version has a different dried fruit and dark malt. The blend of spices along with the earthiness of the Brettanomyces and buckwheat honey make for an almost savory beer. Brett C is a good complement to the Dupont strain because it helps to dry out the beer.

Ingredients
9.5 lbs. (4.3 kg) German Pilsner malt
2 lbs. (0.91 kg) German Munich malt
0.50 lbs. (0.23 kg) flaked oats
6 oz. (0.17 kg) Carafa® Special II malt
6 oz. (0.17 kg) Caramunich® malt
4 oz. (0.11 kg) Special B malt
0.0088 oz. (0.25 g) anise
0.035 oz. (1.0 g) star anise
0.018 oz. (0.50 g) cinnamon
1 lb. (0.45 kg) dried figs
4 oz. (113 g) buckwheat honey
7.5 AAU Simcoe hops (80 min.) (0.58 oz./16 g of 13% alpha acids)
White Labs WLP565 (Belgian Saison I) yeast
White Labs WLP645 (Brettanomyces clausenii) yeast
4.2 oz. (120 g) table sugar (priming)

Step by Step
Mash at 156 °F (69 °C) for 60 minutes. Boil for 90 minutes adding hops as indicated. With 5 minutes left in the boil add the ground spices. Simmer the figs with some of the wort for 20 minutes and purée, add at flame out along with the honey. Start fermentation at 68 °F (20 °C) and allow to rise into the low-80s °F (27–28 °C). When the gravity is stable, bottle aiming for 2.4 volumes of carbonation.

Extract Equivalent
Replace the Pilsner malt with 4.75 lbs. (2.2 kg) of Pilsner dried malt extract, and the Munich with 1.25 lbs. (0.57 kg) of Munich liquid malt extract. Steep the remaining grains, omitting the oats, for 30 min at 156 °F (69 °C) before adding the malt extract.

4 lbs. (1.8 kg) Alexander’s pale liquid malt extract
1.5 lbs. (0.68 kg) extra light dried malt extract
4 AAU Chinook hops (60 min.) (0.33 oz./9 g at 12% alpha acids)
1/4 oz. (7 g) German Perle hops (15 min.)
1/2 oz. (14 g) German Perle hops (5 min.)
1 tsp. (5 mL) Irish moss
Wyeast 2308 (Munich lager) or Wyeast 2206 (Bavarian lager) yeast
1.25 cups (300 mL) Muntons extra light dry malt extract (for bottling)

Step by Step
Heat 1 gallon (3.8 L) of water to 155 ºF (68 ºC) and add crystal malts. Remove the pot from the heat and steep at 150 ºF (66 ºC) for 30 minutes. Strain the grain water into the brew pot. Sparge the grains with 1/2 gallon (1.9 L) of 150 ºF (68 ºC) water. Bring the water to a boil, remove from the heat and add Alexander’s pale malt extract syrup, Muntons extra light dried malt extract and Chinook bittering hops.

Add water until the total volume in the brew pot is 2.5 gallons (9.5 L). Boil for 45 minutes then add: Perle flavor hops and Irish Moss. Boil for 10 minutes and Perle aroma hop. Boil for five minutes. Remove the pot from the stove and chill the wort for 20 minutes.

Strain the cooled wort into the primary fermenter and add cold water to obtain 5 1/4 gallons (20 L). When the wort temperature is below 70 ºF (21 ºC) pitch the yeast. Keep the primary fermenter at 60–62 ºF (16–17 ºC) until signs of fermentation begin (approximately one day). Move the primary fermenter to 47–52 ºF (8–11 ºC) and ferment for seven days or until fermentation slows. Siphon the wort into the secondary fermenter (5 gallon glass carboy).

Bottle when fermentation is complete, target gravity is reached and beer has cleared (approximately five weeks) with the 1.25 cups (300 mL) Muntons extra light dry malt extract (boiled for 10 minutes in 2 cups (473 mL) of water). Let prime at 70 ºF (21 ºC) for approximately four weeks until carbonated, then store at cellar temperature.

Partial-mash Method:
Mash 2.25 lbs. (1.02 kg) U.S. 2-row pale malt and the specialty grains at 150 ºF (65.6 ºC) for 90 minutes. Then follow the extract recipe omitting 1.75 lbs. (0.79 kg) Muntons extra light dry malt extract at the beginning of the boil.

All-Grain Method:
Mash 7.5 lbs. (3.4 kg) U.S. 2-row pale malt with the specialty grains at 122 ºF (50 ºC) for 25 minutes then at 140 ºF (65.1 ºC) for 90 minutes. Add 3.3 HBU (18 % less than the extract recipe) of bittering hops for 60 minutes of the boil. Add the hops and Irish moss as indicated by the extract recipe.

This big barleywine is boiled for two and a half hours to contribute toffee and caramel notes and is fermented with a custom blend of London III and Burlington yeast and aged in Jamaican rum barrels.

Ingredients
19.3 lbs. (8.75 kg) Crisp Maris Otter pale ale malt
1.46 lbs. (0.66 kg) Crisp flaked torrefied barley
0.78 lbs. (0.35 kg) Chateau Belgian biscuit malt
3 AAU Magnum hops (60 min.) (0.3 oz./8.5 g at 10% alpha acids)
2.6 AAU Challenger hops (60 min.) (0.3 oz./8.5 g at 8.8% alpha acids)

1.5 oz. (43 g) Challenger hops (whirlpool)
1.5 oz. (43 g) Pioneer hops (whirlpool)
1⁄2 Whirlfloc tablet (10 min.)
White Labs WLP095 (Burlington Ale) yeast
Wyeast 1318 (London Ale III) yeast
3.5 oz. (100 g) medium+ toasted oak cubes soaked in
Jamaican rum
2⁄3 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Target your brewing water at approximately 70 ppm for chlorides and 45 ppm sulfate. This can be achieved using reverse osmosis (RO) water and adding 0.02 oz./gal (0.15 g/L) CaCl2 and 0.01 oz./gal (0.08 g/L) gypsum.

A step mash process is employed for maximum fermentability. Dough-in at a 1.1 qts./lb. (2.3 L/kg) ratio using 5.9 gallons (22.3 L) of water for the mash targeting an initial temperature of 143 °F (62 °C). Rest for 30 minutes then raise temperature to 149 °F (65 °C) and hold for another 30 minutes. For the last step of the mash, raise temperature to 162 °F (72 °C) and hold for 15 minutes. In lieu of performing a step mash, a single infusion mash can be employed with a target temperature of 148 °F (64 °C). Hold at this temperature for 90 minutes to maximize enzymatic conversion.

Sparge using 167 °F (75 °C) water to collect 9 gallons (34 L) of wort. Total boil time is 150 minutes. Add hops and Whirlfloc as indicated. Add the whirlpool hops at flameout, give the wort a vigorous stir, and then cover and let rest for 15 minutes.

Chill the wort to 63 °F (17 °C) and transfer to primary fermenter. Aerate thoroughly prior to pitching yeast blend. Allow fermentation temperatures to slowly rise by 1–2 °F (1 °C) per day up to a maximum of 73 °F (23 °C) to ensure complete fermentation and minimization of fusel alcohol production.

Once primary fermentation is complete (approximately two weeks), rack beer to a CO2-purged first use rum barrel or a clean and sanitized secondary fermenter. If using a secondary fermenter, add rum-soaked oak cubes and age until a balanced rum character is achieved. Force carbonate to 1.8 volumes of CO2 or prime and bottle. Additional aging will contribute a pleasant Sherry-like character to the beer.

Tips for Success:
Hitting the starting gravity for this beer has a dependency on your boil evaporation rate. This recipe assumes an evaporation rate of 15% per hour. Depending on the evaporation rate of your system, you may need to adjust the amount of wort collected to hit the target starting gravity with the prescribed boil time.

This is a big beer that requires plenty of healthy yeast to ensure complete fermentation. It is recommended to make a single 3-qt (3-L) starter using one pack of WLP095 and one pack of Wyeast 1318. Pitch yeast when yeast activity is strong

Partial Mash Version:
To brew a partial mash version of Dead End Brew Machine’s Curtis The Destroyer clone reduce the Crisp® Maris Otter pale ale malt to 8.5 lbs. (3.86 kg) and add 6 lbs. (2.72 kg) Briess CBW® pale ale dried malt extract. Heat 3.2 gallons (12.1 L) of water to 161 °F (72 °C) and submerge large steeping bag containing the crushed grains into water. Stir grains to ensure sufficient hydration and mash for 90 minutes targeting a mash temperature of 148 °F (64 °C). Remove bag from pot and sparge with 170 °F (77 °C) water to collect a total of 4.25 gallons (16 L) of wort.

Boil wort for 60 minutes, adding hops and Whirlfloc according to the schedule. Add the dried malt extract in the last 10 minutes of the boil.

Follow the remainder of the all-grain recipe instructions, being sure to top your fermenter off to 5 gallons (19 L) prior to fermentation.

This deep, dark colored beer features lots of coffee and chocolate flavors.

Ingredients
10 lbs. (4.5 kg) Dingemans pale ale malt (4 °L)
1 lb. (0.45 kg) Special B malt (125 °L)
0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) chocolate malt
1.25 lbs. (0.57 kg) roasted barley (450 °L)
3 lbs. (1.4 kg) Belgian dark candi sugar (15 min.)
14 AAU Nugget hops (60 min.) (1 oz./28 g at 14% alpha acids)
7 AAU Nugget hops (20 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 14% alpha acids)
White Labs WLP510 (Bastogne Belgian Ale) or Wyeast 3942 (Belgian Wheat) yeast
3⁄4 cup (150 g) dextrose (if priming)

Step by Step
Step mash at 125 °F (52 °C) for 15 minutes, 145 °F (63 °C) for 35 minutes, 165 °F (74 °C) for 25 minutes, and 172 °F (78 °C) for 5 minutes. Collect wort and boil for 60 minutes adding hops at times indicated. Cool the wort, aerate, and pitch yeast. Ferment at 72 °F (22 °C). Once fermentation is complete, bottle or keg as usual.

Partial mash option:
Reduce the pale ale malt in the all-grain recipe to 3 lbs. (1.4 kg) and add 3.3 lbs. (1.5 kg) Maris Otter liquid malt extract and 1 lb. (0.45 kg) extra light dried malt extract. Heat 5.5 qts. (5.2 L) of soft water to 163 °F (73 °C) in a large kitchen pot. Stir 1⁄2 tsp. calcium sulfate (gypsum) or calcium chloride into this water. In another pot, heat 2.5 qts (2.4 L) of soft water to around 163 °F (73 °C). Stir 1 tsp. calcium carbonate (chalk) or 1⁄2 tsp. sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) into this water. In your brewpot, begin heating a half-gallon (2 L) of water to around 170 °F (77 °C). Place crushed pale malt and Special B in one grain bag and place in mash tun. Put remaining dark grains (crushed) in the other bag. Add the 5.5 qts. (5.2 L) of water to the pale grains in the mash tun and stir it in. Let this mash, starting at 152 °F (67 °C), for 45 minutes. Likewise, steep the specialty grains in the pot of carbonate-rich water for 45 minutes (around 152 °F/67 °C). While grains mash and steep, heat 2 gallons (7.6 L) of water to 180 °F (82 °C). When mashing and steeping is complete, scoop 1 qt. (1 L) of 170 °F (77 °C) water from your brewpot. Lift the specialty grains out of their pot and place in a colander over your brewpot. Pour the "grain tea" through the grain bag and then rinse the grains with the water pulled from your brewpot. Start heating this "grain tea" while you collect the wort from the cooler. To collect wort from mash, recirculate about 2.5 qts. (2.4 L) of wort, then add 180 °F (82 °C) water to cooler until it is full. Draw off wort and add to brewpot until the liquid level in the cooler is just above the grain bed. Add 180 °F (82 °C) water to fill cooler again. Repeat this process until you have collected 2 gallons (7.6 L) of wort. Add dried malt extract and bring wort to a boil for 60 minutes, adding hops at times indicated. Stir in liquid malt extract and Belgian candi sugar for the final 15 minutes of the boil. Cool wort to 72 °F (22 °C) and transfer to fermenter, topping off to 5 gallons 919 L). Follow the remaining portion of the all-grain recipe.

Ingredients
6.0 lbs. (2.7 kg) Alexander’s Pale liquid malt extract (or 5.0 lbs. (2.3 kg) Muntons Extra Light dried malt extract)
1 lb. (0.45 kg) domestic two-row pale malt
0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) CaraPils® malt
6 AAU Cascade hops (45 min.) (1.0 oz./28 g of 6% alpha acid)
2.25 AAU Liberty hops (10 min.) (0.5 oz./14.2 g of 4.5% alpha acid)
2.25 AAU Liberty hops (0 min.) (0.5 oz./14.2 g of 4.5% alpha acid)
1 pkg. Burton water salts
1 pkg. Nottingham Ale or Wyeast 1056 (American Ale), 1007 (German Ale), White Labs WLP001 (California Ale) or WLP029 (German Ale) yeast.
1 pkg. Bru-Vigor
0.75 cup corn sugar (for priming)

Step by Step
In a small saucepan, bring a gallon (3.8 L) of water to 160–170 °F (71–77 °C). Add the bag of grains and water salts and steep 30 minutes. Now, gently sparge (rinse) the grains with hot tap water (ideal temperature 168 °F/76 °C) and bring the total volume up to two or more gallons in your brewpot. Bring to boil.

Turn off heat and add malt extract. Return to boil, add the hops at the times specified in the ingredient list. Add the last does of Liberty hops and immediately turn off heat. Let stand for 20-30 minutes in a cooling bath. Pour the cooled wort into the fermenter. Bring the volume up to five gallons (19 L).

If the temperature is less than 80 °F (27 °C), pitch the yeast and the packet of Bru-Vigor (if using) into the wort and place the lid and airlock over the fermenter. Ferment at 65–70 °F (18–24 °C).

After fermentation, check the specific gravity. The F.G. should be 1.011 or less. If it is higher than 1.016, allow to ferment and settle for a few more days. Prime and bottle.

Allow beer to age at room temperature for at least two weeks. Peak flavor is reachednafter six weeks.

All-grain option:
Substitute eight pounds (3.6 kg) of pale malt for the malt extract.

Ingredients
16.5 lbs. (7.5 kg) 2-row pale malt
1.5 lbs. (0.68 kg) Munich malt (10 °L)
1.3 lbs. (0.6 kg) flaked oats
15 oz. (0.43 kg) chocolate malt
12 oz. (0.34 kg) roasted barley
3 oz. (85 g) caramel malt (120 °L)
3 oz. (85 g) Carafa® Special III malt
12.5 AAU Columbus pellet hops (90 min.) (0.82 oz./23 g at 15.5% alpha acids)
4.5 AAU Willamette pellet hops (20 min.) (0.82 oz./23 g at 5.5% alpha acids)
8 AAU Willamette pellet hops (0 min.) (1.33 oz./37 g at 5.5% alpha acids)
1⁄2 tsp. yeast nutrient (15 min.)
1⁄2 Whirfloc® tablet (15 min.)
1.1 oz. (31 g) ground Sumatra coffee (0 min.)
1.2 oz. (34 g) cacao nibs (0 min.)
White Labs WLP007 (Dry English Ale Yeast), Wyeast 1098 (British Ale), or Lallemand Nottingham yeast
2⁄3 cup (66 g) dextrose (if priming)

Step by Step
Mill the grains (flaked oats don’t need to be milled) and mix with 6 gallons (22.7 L) of 169 °F (76 °C) strike water to reach a mash temperature of 154 °F (68 °C). Hold this temperature for 60 minutes. Vorlauf until your runnings are clear. Now sparge the grains with 3.5 gallons (13.25 L) of 169 °F (76 °C) water until 7 gallons (26.5 L) of 1.068 specific gravity wort is collected in your boil kettle. Boil for 90 minutes adding hops, yeast nutrient, and kettle finings according to the ingredients list. After the boil, turn off the heat and add the 0 min. hop additions, coffee, and cacao nibs. Whirlpool the kettle by gently stirring with a mash paddle for 2 minutes and then let rest for an addition 28 minutes to achieve a 30-minute flame out steep. Next, chill the wort to 64 °F (18 °C) and transfer into a clean and sanitized fermenter. Aerate the wort with pure oxygen for 90 seconds and pitch yeast. Allow fermentation to free rise up to 68 °F (20 °C) and hold it at that temperature until the beer reaches 60% apparent attenuation (1.035) then ramp fermentation temperature up to 72 °F (22 °C) and hold at this temperature for an additional 14 days. Begin to slowly crash cool the fermenter down at the rate of 5 °F (2.8 °C) per day for 8 days until the beer reaches 32 °F (0 °C) and then bottle or keg the beer. Carbonate to between 2.2 and 2.3 volumes of CO2.

Extract with grains option:
Substitute the 2-row pale malt, Munich malt, and flaked oats in the all-grain recipe with 6 oz. (170 g) Carafoam® malt, 2 lbs. (0.9 kg) Munich dried malt extract, and 10 lbs. (4.5 kg) golden light liquid malt extract. Place the crushed grains in a grain bag, then add to 2 gallons (7.6 L) of 150 °F (66 °C) water. Allow grains to steep for 20–30 minutes while you continue to heat the water up to no hotter than 170 °F (77 °C) in order to avoid extracting tannins. Next, remove the grain bag, top your kettle up with enough pre-heated water to reach a total pre-boil volume of 7 gallons (26.5L), and turn your heat source back on. Once you reach a boil, add your malt extract, hops, yeast nutrient, and kettle finings, according to the ingredients list. The remainder of this recipe is the same as the all-grain recipe.

Tips for Success:
This is a high-gravity beer that will require lots (about 334 billion total cells) of yeast for a healthy fermentation. If you have 1 White Labs vial or 1 Wyeast Activator pack you will need to either make a 1.75-L stir plate starter or a 5-L non-stir plate starter in advance. If you are unable to make a starter, be prepared to pitch at least 3.5 vials/packs of fresh yeast. Oxygenating your wort with pure oxygen for 90 seconds prior to pitching your yeast and (optionally) for an additional 30 seconds 12–18 hours after you initially pitch your yeast is recommended to ensure optimal yeast growth. Due to the high gravity and use of ground coffee in this beer, the extended fermentation and cold conditioning period outlined above is beneficial. It will allow the yeast ample time to ferment the beer completely, reabsorb diacetyl properly, and allow the ground coffee to completely settle before packaging which helps to avoid creating nucleation points that could lead to "gushers" if bottling.

Remove all grains and wash with 1 gallon (4 L) hot water. Stir in the dried malt extract and top off to 6.5 gallons (24.6 L). Bring to a boil and boil for a total of 60 minutes adding hops according to the ingredients list. Remove from heat, there should be 5.25 gallons (20 L) of wort. Cool to 70 °F (21 °C), and pitch yeast. Allow temperature to free rise during active fermentation, but don't allow the fermentation temperature to exceed 80 °F (27 °C). Rack to secondary and condition cool (50 °F/10 °C) for two to four weeks. Prime and bottle or keg and force carbonate. Serve at 50 °F (10 °C) in a "bolleke."

Due to the low gravity of this wort, no yeast starter is needed.

On brew day, mash in the crushed malt at 158 °F (70 °C) in 7.5 gallons (28.4 L) of water in a mash tun brew-in-a-bag setup. Hold at this temperature for 60 minutes. Raise mash temperature to 170 °F (77 °C), hold for 5 minutes then recirculate or remove the grain bag. Do not sparge, run-off wort into the kettle if using a separate mash tun. Bring wort to a boil and boil for 60 minutes, adding hops at times indicated.

Chill the wort down to yeast-pitching temperature, aerate, and pitch the yeast. Ferment around 66 °F (19 °C). Condition for one week then package as normal.

Make sure to compensate for the extra volume of grapes or grape juice you will be adding to the primary fermenter. This recipe was designed so that at the end of brew day your fermenter only contains 4.5 gallons (17 L) of wort. The original gravity is calculated without the grape juice while the ABV is calculated with grape juice.

Ingredients
10 lbs. (4.5 kg) 2-row pale malt
1.4 lbs. (0.64 kg) flaked triticale (can substitute flaked rye and/or flaked wheat)
1.15 lbs. (0.52 kg) liquid amber candi sugar (90 min.)
0.8 oz. (22 g) dried whole chamomile flowers (0 min.)
2 qts. (1.9 L) white wine grape juice OR 6–7 lbs. (2.7–3.2 kg) crushed white wine grapes (primary fermentation)
11 AAU Perle hops (90 min.) (1.1 oz./31 g at 10% alpha acid)
Wyeast 3522 (Belgian Ardennes) or White Labs WLP550 (Belgian Ale) yeast
Priming sugar (if bottling)

Step by Step
This is a single infusion mash, with a conversion rest at 148 °F (64 °C) for 105 minutes. This helps provide a fermentable wort. Raise the mash temperature to 165 °F (74 °C) after conversion rest to stop the enzymatic conversion of starches to sugars before lautering. Recirculate your wort gently for 5-15 minutes, depending on your system, before diverting wort flow to your kettle/boiling vessel. If you have a refractometer, check your "first wort" (unsparged wort) gravity, it should be about 1.088–1.092 SG. Sparge water should be between 165 and 170 °F (74 and 77 °C) to maximize extraction, but avoid going over 170 °F (77 °C) or you’ll extract harsh compounds from the malt husks. Sparge until you hit your target boil volume or until your wort gravity being drawn-off reaches 1.012 SG, whichever comes first. Don’t lauter past this gravity, because when the sparged wort coming off the lauter is that low in sugar content, you risk extracting tannins and other harsh character from the malt husks.

Add all the hops at the start of boil. Stone typically boils their wort for 90 minutes to get about 8–10% evaporation. Depending on your boil parameters, you may want or need to add some portion of the hops before the boil actually starts (first wort hopping) to keep the foaming under control. Add the amber candi sugar after the boil starts so the sugar can’t settle on the bottom of the kettle and scorch as the heat increases.
After the wort boil is complete, add the chamomile flowers (in a muslin brew bag) to maximize flavor extraction. Chill the wort using an immersion chiller or a heat exchanger to about 65–70 °F (18–21 °C). Pitch enough yeast to get 20-25 million cells per milliliter (requires a starter). Stone uses the Wyeast 3522 Belgian Ardennes strain, because it doesn’t produce a lot of phenolic clove flavors and ferments strongly to dryness. Stone used a fairly high pitching rate here, because they wanted to ferment at a lower temperature but still ensure the beer fermented out completely.

Ferment at 72 °F (22 °C) to maximize fruity ester formation and reduce the clove/spicy flavor formations, which form at higher levels with warmer Belgian yeast fermentation temperatures, above ~75 °F (24 °C). At 1.040 SG (about halfway through primary fermentation) add the grape juice. Use unsulfited juice to ensure fermentation will proceed, and add the juice at the height of the beer fermentation. Stone reports that their juice was approximately 35% Gewürztraminer, 30% Muscat Canelli, 20% Sauvignon Blanc and 15% Riesling, but any Muscat variety or blend would work. After fermentation is complete, chill the beer down to about 35 °F (2 °C) or so, and let it sit until the beer clarifies, at least one week. Bottle or keg the beer as normal. The 10.10.10 Vertical Epic Ale clone will be wonderful fresh, but the wine flavors should develop further over time.

This original high-gravity brew is made with Pilsner malt, German lager yeast, and German Perle hops and features a slightly sweet flavor and dry aroma.

Ingredients
16 lbs. (7.3 kg) Pilsner malt
6.2 AAU Perle hop pellets (60 min.) (0.75 oz./21.3 g at 8.25 % alpha acids)
2.1 AAU Perle hop pellets (30 min.) (0.25 oz./7.1 g at 8.25 % alpha acids)
4.1 AAU Perle hop pellets (5 min.) (0.5 oz./14.2 g at 8.25 % alpha acids)
1/2 tsp. yeast nutrient (15 min.)
1/2 tsp. Irish moss (30 min.)
White Labs WLP 830 (German Lager) or Wyeast 2308 (Munich Lager) yeast
3/4 cup (150g) dextrose (if bottling)

Step by Step
This is a single step infusion mash. Mix the crushed grains with 5.2 gallons (19.7 L) of 174 °F (79 °C) water to stabilize at 154 °F (68 °C) for 60 minutes. Sparge slowly with 175 °F (79 °C) water. Collect approximately 6 gallons (23 L) of wort runoff to boil for 60 minutes. While boiling, add the hops, Irish moss, and yeast nutrient as per the schedule. Cool the wort to 75 °F (24 °C). Pitch your yeast and aerate the wort heavily. Allow the beer to cool over the next few hours to 65 °F (19 °C). When evidence of fermentation is apparent drop the temperature to 52 °F (11 °C). Hold at that temperature until fermentation is complete (approx. 10 days). Transfer to a carboy, avoiding any splashing to prevent aerating the beer. Condition for 2 weeks at 42 °F (5 °C) and then bottle or keg.

Extract with grains option:
Reduce the Pilsner malt in the all-grain recipe to 3 lbs. (1.36 kg) and add 6.6 lbs. (3 kg) Briess Pilsner liquid malt extract and 2 lbs. (0.9 kg) dried malt extract. Steep the crushed grains in 2 gallons (7.6 L) of water at 154 °F (68 °C) for 30 minutes. Remove grains from the wort and rinse with 2 quarts (1.8 L) of hot water. Add the liquid and dried malt extracts and boil for 60 minutes. Add the hops, Irish moss, and yeast nutrient as per the schedule. After the boil, add the wort to 2 gallons (7.6 L) of cold water in a sanitized fermenter and top off with cold water up to 5 gallons (19 L). Follow the remaining portion of the all-grain recipe.

Denny's Bourbon Vanilla Imperial Porter
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.086 FG = 1.028
SRM = 45 IBU = 32 ABV = 7.8%

Ingredients
12 lbs. (5.4 kg) 2-row pale malt
2.5 lbs. (1.13 kg) German Munich malt (10 °L)
1.5 lbs. (0.68 kg) brown malt
1.25 lbs. (0.57 g) chocolate malt (350 °L)
1 lb. (0.45 kg) crystal malt (120 °L)
0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) crystal malt (40 °L)
9.8 AAU Magnum hops (60 min.) (0.65 oz./18 g at 15% alpha acids)
2.4 AAU East Kent Goldings hops (10 min. ) (0.4 oz./11 g at 6% alpha acids)
2 vanilla beans, split, scraped, and chopped
1.6 cups Jim Beam Black Bourbon
1⁄2 Whirlfloc tablet (5 min.)
Wyeast 1450 (Denny’s Favorite 50 Ale) or SafAle US-05 yeast
2⁄3 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Mash at 155 °F (68 °C) using 23.6 quarts (22.2 L) of water for 60 minutes. Lauter as you normally would. Bring wort to a boil. Total boil time is 70 minutes with the first hop addition 10 minutes into the boil and the second hop addition during the final 10 minutes. Add the Whirlfloc with 5 minutes remaining.

Chill the wort down to yeast-pitching temperature, aerate heavily, and pitch a sufficient starter (or 2 packets) of yeast. Ferment around 66 °F (19 °C).

When fermentation is complete, split 2 vanilla beans lengthwise. Scrape all the seeds and "gunk" from them and add it to the fermenter. Chop the beans into 2–3 in. (5–7.5 cm) long pieces and add them, too. Leave in secondary for 10–14 days, then taste. You want the vanilla to be a bit on the strong side since it will fade. If the vanilla flavor is adequate, rack to bottling bucket or keg and add approximately 375 mL (1.6 cups) of Jim Beam Black Bourbon. You don’t need to use an expensive Bourbon, and you don’t want to add a lot. The beer shouldn’t scream "BOURBON!" at you. You should have an integrated flavor of the chocolatey porter, vanilla, and Bourbon. This beer does not benefit from extended aging. I prefer it within a few months of brewing. The FG should be in the mid-high 20s, so don’t worry about trying to get it lower.

Denny’s Generic West Coast IPA
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.069 FG = 1.012
IBU = 72 SRM = 12 ABV = 7.5%

Ingredients
13 lbs. (5.9 kg) North American 2-row pale malt
1.5 lbs. (0.68 kg) crystal malt (60 °L)
16.5 AAU Chinook hops (60 min.) (1.25 oz./35 g at 13.2% alpha acids)
6.8 AAU Cascade hops (5 min.) (1 oz./28 g at 6.8% alpha acids)
12 AAU Centennial hops (0 min.) (1 oz./28 g at 12% alpha acids)
2 oz. (57 g) Cascade Cryo® hops (dry hop)
Wyeast 1056 (American Ale), White Labs WLP001 (California Ale),
Imperial Yeast A07 (Flagship), or Lallemand BRY-97 yeast
¾ cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Using a fairly thick mash, achieve a single infusion mash temperature of 153 °F (67 °C). Hold at this temperature for 60 minutes. Start lautering by raising mash temperature up to 168 °F (66 °C), then hold for ten minutes. Sparge with enough water to collect about 6.5 gallons (24.6 L) of wort and boil for 60 minutes. Add the hops as stated in the recipe.

Upon completion of the boil, chill the wort to 63 °F (17 °C), pitch a healthy count of yeast and oxygenate thoroughly (if using a liquid strain). As fermentation slows, you may allow the temperature to rise up to 68 °F (20 °C) to ensure completion. Total fermentation time should be about one week so the yeast has time to clean up its off-flavors. Drop temperature to 45 °F (7 °C) and add dry hop. Wait two days then keg and carbonate to 2.6 v/v or bottle.

Ingredients
7 lbs. (3.2 kg) golden dried malt extract
1.5 lbs. (0.68 kg) crystal malt (60 °L)
16.5 AAU Chinook hops (60 min.) (1.25 oz./35 g at 13.2% alpha acids)
6.8 AAU Cascade hops (5 min.) (1 oz./28 g at 6.8% alpha acids)
12 AAU Centennial hops (0 min.) (1 oz./28 g at 12% alpha acids)
2 oz. (57 g) Cascade Cryo® hops (dry hop)
Wyeast 1056 (American Ale), White Labs WLP001 (California Ale),
Imperial Yeast A07 (Flagship), or Lallemand BRY-97 yeast
¾ cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Heat 3 gallons (11.4 L) of water in your kettle and add the crushed crystal malt in a muslin bag. Submerge the grains in the water and steep until the temperature reaches about 160 °F (71 °C) Remove the grains, you can gently squeeze the grains to get most of the liquid out. Off heat add the dried malt extract and add water to have 6.5 gallons (24.6 L) wort. Bring wort to a boil. Follow all-grain recipe for remaining boil, fermentation, and packaging instructions.

Notes From Denny:
You can substitute a different "character" malt for the crystal, like Munich or Victory®. You can use all pale malt. You can use Magnum or Warrior® hops for bittering. For a more traditional West Coast IPA, avoid tropical fruit hops. For a more modern take, go crazy with hops like Citra® or Mosaic®. This is a style you can customize to your liking as long as it’s crisp and bitter.

Top up if necessary to obtain 6 gallons (23 L) of 1.046 SG wort. Boil for 60 minutes, adding hops and finings according to the ingredients list. Turn off the heat and chill the wort to slightly below fermentation temperature, about 61 °F (16 °C). Aerate the wort with pure oxygen or filtered air and pitch the yeast. Ferment at 63 °F (17 °C). Once you reach terminal gravity (approximately seven days total) bottle or keg the beer and carbonate.

A hop-forward gluten-free pale ale cleverly brewed with brown rice syrup and Belgian candi syrup for a beer that gluten-free and non-gluten-free drinkers can all enjoy! Brewed exclusively at Deschutes’ Portland Public House in Portland, Oregon.

Ingredients
6 lbs. (2.7 kg) brown rice syrup
1 lb. 1 oz. (0.5 kg) dark Belgian candi syrup (90 °L)
6 oz. (170 g) honey (0 min.)
9.8 AAU Nugget hops (60 min.) (0.75 oz./21 g at 13% alpha acids)
1.8 AAU Crystal hops (30 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 3.5% alpha acids)
0.5 oz. (14 g) Nugget hops (0 min.)
0.5 oz. (14 g) Crystal hops (0 min.)
1 tsp. Irish moss (15 min.)
Wyeast 1187 (Ringwood Ale) or White Labs WLP005 (British Ale) yeast
5 g CaSO4, gypsum (if using reverse osmosis water)
3/4 cup (150 g) dextrose (if priming)

Step by step
Heat approximately 5 gallons (19 L) of water to boiling. Turn off the heat, add the brown rice syrup and candi syrup, and stir until completely dissolved. Top up if necessary to obtain 6 gallons (23 L) of wort and add optional minerals. Boil for 60 minutes, adding hops and finings according to the ingredients list. Turn off the heat, add the honey, stir until it is completely dissolved, and then chill the wort to slightly below fermentation temperature, about 61 °F (16 °C). Aerate wort and pitch yeast. Ferment at 63 °F (17 °C). Once at terminal gravity (approximately seven days total) bottle or keg the beer and carbonate.

Tips for success:
Brown rice syrup can sometimes be difficult to find at local homebrew shops. There are a few online suppliers if your local homebrew supplier does not carry it, but you also may want to experiment with pale rice malt or the dry equivalent, which is rice syrup solids. To use the pale rice malt, swap out the brown rice syrup with 15 lbs. (6.8 kg) rice malt and be sure to add amylase enzyme to the mash. To use the rice syrup solids, simply swap the brown rice syrup with 5.25 lbs. (2.4 kg) rice syrup solids, but expect a slightly lighter color in the finished beer.

14 ounces (0.39 kg) Caramunich® malt (60 °L)
11 ounces (0.31 kg) Dextrin malt
4 ounces (0.11 kg) Briess Extra Special malt
1 tsp. Irish moss
3.3 AAU Nugget hops (0.25 oz./7 g at 13% alpha acids) (60 min.)
2.6 AAU Centennial hops (0.25 oz./7 g at 10.5% alpha acids) (60 min.)

Step by Step
Steep the crushed grains in approximately 2 gallons (7.6 L) of water at 150 °F (66 °C) for 30 minutes. Remove the grains from the wort and wash the grains with 2 qts. (2 L) hot water. Bring the wort up to a boil, and add 0.5 lbs (0.22 kg) of the light dried malt extract. Now add your Nugget hops and first addition of Centennial hops and boil these hops for 60 minutes. 30 minutes into the boil, add your second addition of Centennial hops and Irish moss. Add the 6.6 pounds (3 kg) of liquid malt extract for the last 5 minutes of the boil and stir to thoroughly mix in the beer and avoid scorching the malt extract to the bottom of your kettle. At the end of your 60-minute boil turn your heat off, and add your 1 pound (0.45 kg) of fresh hops.

Stir the fresh hops into the beer for 5 minutes. Add the wort to about 2 gallons (9 L) of cold water in your sanitized fermenter, and top up to 5.25 (19.75 L) gallons. Cool the wort to 65 °F (18 °C) and add your yeast. Aerate your beer, and ferment the beer at 68 °F (20 °C) until fermentation is complete.

All-Grain Option:
Replace the liquid and dried malt extract with 11 lbs (5 kg) of 2-row pale malt. Mash at 157 °F (69 °C) for 30 minutes, and mash off at 168 °F (75 °C) for an additional 5 minutes, then collect about 6.5 gallons (24.5 L) of wort. Boil for 30 minutes without any hop additions, then boil 60 minutes with your Nugget and first addition of Centennial hops. Add the second addition of Centennial hops and Irish moss for the last 30 minutes of the boil. Turn off your burner, and now steep your 1 lb. (0.45 kg) of fresh hops for 5 minutes, then cool your wort, fill your fermenter and ferment at 68 °F (20 °C) until fermentation is complete.

Step by Step
Mill the grains and dough-in targeting a mash thickness that will enable your system to achieve the necessary pre-boil volume and gravity. Hold the mash at 150 °F (66 °C) until enzymatic conversion is complete. Infuse the mash with near boiling water while stirring or with a recirculating mash system raise the temperature to mash out at 168 °F (76 °C). Sparge slowly with 170 °F (77 °C) water, collecting wort until the pre-boil kettle volume is around 6.5 gallons (25 L) and the gravity is 1.052 (12.9 °P).

The total wort boil time is 90 minutes. Add the bittering hops as soon as the wort starts boiling. With 30 minutes remaining in the boil, add the second hop additon. Add Irish moss or other kettle finings with15 minutes left in the boil. Add the remaining hop addition at 5 minutes. Chill the wort to 65 °F (18 °C) and aerate thoroughly. The proper pitch rate is 16 grams of properly rehydrated dry yeast, 2.3 packages of liquid yeast or 1 package of liquid yeast in a 2.7-liter starter.

Ferment at 65 °F (18 °C) until the yeast drops clear. Allow the lees to settle and the brew to mature without pressure for another two days after fermentation appears finished. Rack to a keg and force carbonate or rack to a bottling bucket, add priming sugar, and bottle. Target a carbonation level of 2.5 volumes.

Step by step
I use an ultra-light extract made by Alexander's (California Concentrate Company), but any fresh, high quality light color extract will work well. Always choose the freshest extract that fits the beer style instead of focusing on the brand name. If you cannot get fresh liquid malt extract, it is better to use an appropriate amount of dried malt extract (DME) instead.

Mill or coarsely crack the specialty malt and place loosely in a grain bag. Avoid packing the grains too tightly in the bag, using more bags if needed. Steep the bag in about 1.5 gallon (~6 liters) of water at roughly 170 °F (77 °C) for about 30 minutes. Lift the grain bag out of the steeping liquid and rinse with warm water. Allow the bags to drip into the kettle for a few minutes while you add the malt extract. Do not squeeze the bags. Add enough water to the steeping liquor and malt extract to make a pre-boil volume of 6.5 gallons (25 L) and the gravity is 1.052 (12.9 °P). Stir thoroughly to help dissolve the extract and bring to a boil.

The total wort boil time is 90 minutes. Add the bittering hops as soon as the wort starts boiling. With 30 minutes remaining in the boil, add the second hop additon. Add Irish moss or other kettle finings with15 minutes left in the boil. Add the remaining hop addition at 5 minutes. Chill the wort to 65 °F (18 °C) and aerate thoroughly. The proper pitch rate is 16 grams of properly rehydrated dry yeast, 2.3 packages of liquid yeast or 1 package of liquid yeast in a 2.7-liter starter.

Ferment at 65 °F (18 °C) until the yeast drops clear. Allow the lees to settle and the brew to mature without pressure for another two days after fermentation appears finished.

In December 2010, head brewer Jason Oliver of Devil’s Backbone Brewing Co. of Roseland, Virginia collaborated with Alistair Reece, homebrewer and beer blogger (http://www.fuggled.net/), on a traditional double-decocted tmavé. Reece penned the recipe and named the beer for the Slavic goddess of death and renewal. Oliver has won an astonishing amount of brewing medals and is a staunch proponent of decoction mashing (see inset), and Weyermann floor malted Bohemian Pilsner malt.

Ingredients
8.75 lbs. (4.0 kg) German or Czech Pilsner malt
1.25 lbs. (0.57 kg) CaraBohemian® (CaraMunich® I) malt
1.25 lbs. (0.57 kg) German Munich malt
0.45 lbs. (0.20 kg) Carafa® Special II malt
5.3 AAU Saaz hops (60 min) (1.3 oz./38 g of 4% alpha acids)
2.2 AAU Saaz hops (20 min) (0.55 oz./16 g of 4% alpha acids)
0.375 oz. (11 g) Saaz hops (5 min)
Wyeast 2782 (Staro Prague Lager) yeast (7.0 qt./6.5 L yeast starter)
3⁄4 cup (150 g) dextrose (if priming)

Step By Step
Ideally you should employ a step infusion or decoction mash with rests at 126 °F (52 °C), 144 °F (62 °C), 154 °F (68 °C) and 162 °F (72 °C). If your equipment (or social demands) limit you to a single infusion, mashing 60 minutes at 152 °F (67 °C) is adequate. Boil the wort for 90 minutes, adding hops at the times indicated. Chill to 46 °F (8 °C). Oxygenate with pure oxygen for 60 seconds. Pitch a large starter of the yeast, or multiple vials to reach at least 350 billion cells. Ferment for 10 days keeping the temperature of the wort at 50 °F (10 °C). As fermentation slows, raise the temperature for a diacetyl rest to 60 °F (16 °C). When the final gravity is reached, and there is no perception of diacetyl, chill the wort to 32 °F (0 °C) for two months of lagering. If you want to barrel age the beer, do so before lagering. Carbonate to 2.4 volumes of CO2.

The gold standard for Vienna lagers in North America, known for its smooth, malty finish and drinkability. This beer from Devils Backbone (Roseland, Virginia) has won gold at the Great American Beer Festival three times since 2012, plus numerous other accolades.

Ingredients
4.1 lbs. (1.9 kg) Pilsner malt
4.1 lbs. (1.9 kg) Vienna malt
1.25 lbs. (0.57 kg) dark Munich malt
1.25 lbs. (0.57 kg) Weyermann Caraamber® malt (26 °L)
3.75 AAU German Northern Brewer hops (60 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 7.5% alpha acids)
1.75 AAU Czech Saaz hops (20 min.) (0.5 oz./14g at 3.5% alpha acids)
Imperial L17 (Harvest) or Omega Yeast OLY-114 (Bayern Lager) or Mangrove Jack’s M76 (Bavarian Lager) yeast
3⁄4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
With a loose 3-to-1 water-to-grist ratio (~1.5 qts./lb.), conduct a protein rest at 125 °F (52 °C), holding for 30 minutes. Raise temperature to 147 °F (64 °C) and hold for 30 minutes for beta amylase rest. Raise temperature to 162 °F (72 °C) for 30 more minutes to convert alpha amylase. Mash out for ten minutes at 170 °F (77 °C). Recirculate until clear, then sparge until you collect about 7 gallons (26.5 L) of wort. Boil for 90 minutes, adding hops as indicated. If you choose to add clarifiers such as Whirlfloc or Irish moss, do so with 15 minutes remaining in the boil.

Chill to 52 °F (11 °C) then pitch ample amount of healthy yeast. Oxygenate thoroughly. Allow temperatures to rise to 54–54.5 °F (12 °C) during the main fermentation period. When fermentation is about two-thirds complete, raise temperatures to 56 °F (13 °C) to finish fermenting remaining sugars. At end of fermentation, let rise to 57 °F (14 °C) for diacetyl rest. Seven to 10 days after pitching. Start cooling 2 °F (1 °C) per day until you reach a temperature between 42–44 °F (6–7 °C). Rack off the yeast and transfer to a secondary for aging. Crash cool to lagering temperatures between 28–34 °F (-2 °C to 1 °C). Lager for a minimum of two weeks, but the beer will benefit from a lagering period of four weeks or more. Force carbonate to 2.5 volumes or prime and bottle condition.

Devil’s Purse Brewing Co.’s Handline Kölsch clone
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.048 FG = 1.009
IBU = 20 SRM = 4 ABV = 5.1%

Ingredients
7.25 lbs. (3.29 kg) Pilsner malt
2.75 lbs. (1.25 kg) Vienna malt
5 AAU Vanguard hops (60 min.) (1 oz./28 g at 5% alpha acids)
2.5 AAU Vanguard hops (5 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 5% alpha acids)
Wyeast 2565 (Kölsch) or White Labs WLP003 (German Ale II) or SafAle K-97 yeast
¾ cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Start with either soft water, reverse osmosis (RO) water, or distilled water. Mill the grains, then mix with strike water at a 1.25 qts./lb. (2.6 L/kg) water-to-grain ratio, or 3.1 gallons (11.8 L) of 165 °F (74 °C) strike water to achieve a single infusion rest temperature of 148 °F (64 °C). Adjust water with calcium salts and 88% lactic acid to stabilize mash pH at 5.3. Hold at this temperature for 60 minutes. Mashout to 170 °F (77 °C) if desired.

Vorlauf until your runnings are clear before directing them to your boil kettle. Batch or fly sparge the mash and run-off to obtain 6.5 gallons (25 L) of wort. Boil for 60 minutes, adding hops at the times indicated in the ingredients list. At 15 minutes left in boil, you may want to add either Irish moss or Whirlfloc as fining agents.

After the boil, rapidly chill the wort to 65 °F (18 °C) then pitch a healthy amount of yeast, higher than your standard ale pitch rate. Maintain this temperature during active fermentation in order to prevent too much yeast character.

Once primary fermentation is complete, and the beer has settled, you can bottle or keg the beer and carbonate to approximately 2.6 volumes. Alternatively, if you can, cold lager the beer for about one month.

OG = 1.047 FG = 1.009
IBU = 20 SRM = 5 ABV = 5%

Ingredients
4 lbs. (1.81 kg) dried malt extract
1.5 lbs. (0.68 kg) liquid Vienna malt extract
5 AAU Vanguard hops (60 min.) (1 oz./28 g at 5% alpha acids)
2.5 AAU Vanguard hops (5 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 5% alpha acids)
Wyeast 2565 (Kölsch) or White Labs WLP003 (German Ale II) or SafAle K-97 yeast
¾ cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Bring 6.5 gallons (25 L) of water to roughly 150 °F (66 °C). Add the malt extracts, with stirring, before heating to a boil. The warmer water will help to dissolve the extracts. Boil for 60 minutes, adding hops at the indicated times left in the boil. At 15 minutes left in boil, you may want to add either Irish moss or Whirlfloc as fining agents.

After the boil, rapidly chill the wort to 65 °F (18 °C). Pitch yeast. Maintain fermentation temperature in order to prevent too colorful of a fermentation character.

Once primary fermentation is complete, and the beer has settled, you can bottle or keg the beer and carbonate to approximately 2.6 volumes. Alternatively, if you can, cold lager the beer for about one month.

Tips for Success:
Although this beer can be brewed using extracts, the best representations will more likely be from all-grain. But, one of the challenges for the all-grain brewer will be in water chemistry management. In the beginning, Devil’s Purse used acidulated malt to help control the mash pH (pH = 5.3) but currently is using 88% food-grade lactic acid. This is important as the South Dennis water is soft so without adjustment, the mash pH will be far too high. If you also read into that last bit, you’ll notice that the carbonates, residual alkalinity, and calcium concentrations are more than likely on the lower side of the spectrum. You may want to consider starting with RO and building up your brewing water profile or diluting your current profile with distilled water. Finally, in the end, this beer just takes patience, unless you have a centrifuge. Cold lagering for a month should provide you with the clarity and crispness you’re looking for.

1 lb. (0.45 kg) Special B malt
1 lb. (0.45 kg) wheat malt
12 oz. (0.34 kg) roasted barley
8 oz. (0.23 kg) black patent malt
8 oz. (0.23 kg) chocolate malt
1 lb. (0.45 kg) lactose sugar
1 lb. (0.45 kg) Lyle’s Black Treacle
16 fl. oz. (473 ml) maple syrup
33 AAU Nugget hops (90 min.) (3 oz./85 g at 11% alpha acids)
7.5 AAU Cascade hops (10 min.) (1 oz./28 g at 7.5% alpha acids)
1 tsp. Irish moss (15 min.)
White Labs WLP051 (California Ale V) or Wyeast 1272 (American Ale II) yeast
Habanero pepper extract (see below) after primary fermentation
¾ cup corn sugar (if priming to bottle)

Step by Step
A week before brewing, dice 10-12 habanero peppers, place in a 32 fl. oz. (0.95 L) jar and fill with vodka to create habanero pepper extract. Two days prior to brewing, make a 2-L yeast starter or alternatively, you can brew a small ale with the yeast to build up enough yeast to pitch into the stout.

This is a single infusion mash. Mix the crushed grains with 7.4 gallons (28 L) of water to stabilize the mash at 152 °F (67 °C) and hold for 120 minutes. Sparge with 3.5 gallons (13.2 L) of 170 °F (77 °C) water.

Collect 7.5 gallons (24.6 L) of wort and add: lactose, treacle and maple syrup and stir to be certain all are thoroughly in solution before beginning your 90 minute boil. Add hops and Irish moss per the schedule on the ingredients list. At the end of the boil, you should have 6 gallons (22.7 L) in your kettle.

After the boil, give your wort a stir to create a whirlpool, then let the wort settle for 30 minutes prior to chilling. Cool the wort to 70 °F (21 °C) for fermenting, aerate well and pitch your yeast. After seven days, rack to secondary fermenter and add habanero extract in 2 fl. oz. (59 mL) increments and taste to achieve desired level of heat. When fermentation is complete and beer has cleared, bottle or keg as usual.

Add boiling hops as soon as the boil starts. Add finishing hops with 5 minutes left in boil. Cover the kettle and let it cool for 20 minutes. Put 2.5 gallons (9.5 L) of very cold water in fermenter and transfer wort into it. Top up to 5.5 gallons (21 L). Aerate and pitch yeast. Ferment for one week at 68–72 °F (20–22 °C). Rack to secondary fermenter and add leaf hops. After another week, bottle, condition and enjoy.

Dick's Brewing Co.'s Bottleworks IPA clone
(5 gallons/19 L, extract with grains)
OG = 1.080 FG = 1.018
IBU = 100+ SRM = 11 ABV = 8.6%

Ingredients
11.75 lbs. (5.3 kg) Briess golden light liquid malt extract
8 oz. (224 g) crystal malt (120 °L)
1 oz. (28 g) chocolate malt
34 AAU Columbus hops (60 min.) (2.25 oz./63 g at 15% alpha acids)
15 AAU Columbus hops (20 min.) (1 oz./28 g at 15% alpha acids)
15 AAU Columbus hops (0 min.) (1 oz./28 g at 15% alpha acids)
1 tsp. Irish moss (15 min.)
White Labs WLP001 (California Ale), Wyeast 1056 (American Ale) or Safale US-05 yeast
3⁄4 cup of corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Steep the crushed malts in 3 gallons (11 L) of water at 155 °F (68 °C) for 30 minutes. Remove grains from wort, add the malt syrup and bring to a boil. Add the Columbus bittering hops then boil for 60 minutes. Add the second addition of Columbus hops for the last 20 minutes of the boil and the Irish moss for the last 15 minutes. Add the remaining Columbus hops at the end of the boil and steep for five minutes. Now add the wort to 2 gallons (7.6 L) of cold water in a sanitary fermenter, and top off with cool water to 5.5 gallons (~21 L). Cool the wort to 75 °F (24 °C), aerate the beer heavily and pitch your yeast. Cool and ferment at 68 °F (20 °C). Dick’s conditions this beer for approximately six weeks, then bottle or keg.

Tips for Success:
To get the full amount of bitterness in an extract IPA, you will need to do a full-wort boil. Also, although hop bitterness is thought not to exceed 100 IBUs, hop flavor and aroma may increase with additional hops. Consider adding more Columbus hops late in the boil if you’re a real hophead.

All-grain option:
This is a single step infusion mash. Replace the malt extract with 18 lbs. (8.2 kg) of 2-row pale malt. Mash the three grains together at 155 °F (68 °C) for 60 minutes. Collect approximately 7 gallons wort (27 L) to boil for 90 minutes to collect 5.5 gallons (~21 L) in the fermenter. The remainder of the recipe is the same as the extract with grains recipe.

(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.061 FG = 1.003
IBU = 23 SRM = 12 ABV = 7.6%

Ingredients
3.5 lbs. (1.6 kg) rye malt
2 lbs. (0.91 kg) 2-row pale malt
8 oz. (227 g) caramel malt (120 ºL)
5 lbs. (2.3 kg) raw blackberry honey
3.5 AAU Columbus hops (60 min.) (0.25 oz./7 g at 14% alpha acids)
3.5 AAU Columbus hops (30 min.) (0.25 oz./7 g at 14% alpha acids)
2.5 tsp. yeast nutrient (15 min.)
Wyeast 3711 (French Saison) or Imperial Yeast B64 (Napoleon) or White Labs WLP590 (French Saison Ale) or Lallemand Belle Saison
4.1 oz. (116 g) honey (if priming)

Step By Step
Mash the grains at 152 ºF (67 ºC) for 60 minutes. Once conversion is complete, recirculate for 15 minutes. Batch sparge with 168 ºF (76 ºC) water, collecting 6 gallons (23 L) of wort.

Boil the wort for 60 minutes, adding hops at the times indicated in the recipe. Add the yeast nutrient to the boil with 15 minutes remaining. A kettle fining can be added near the end of the boil, but this is optional.

While the wort is boiling, prepare a hot water bath and put the container of honey into it. This should help to soften the honey and make it easier to mix with the wort later.

Chill the wort to 64 ºF (18 ºC) and then mix in all of the honey. Aerate the wort with oxygen, pitch the yeast, and ferment until complete. Allow temperature to free-rise into the mid-70s ºF (low-20s ºC). When fermentation is complete, rack and package the braggot, or rack and clarify the braggot if desired with finings before packaging (prime and bottle condition, or keg and force carbonate).

(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.042  FG = 1.011
IBU = 35  SRM = 8  ABV = 4.1%

Ingredients
8 lbs. (3.65 kg) English pale ale malt
7 oz. (200 g) English crystal malt (75 °L)
5.5 AAU Target hops (60 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 11% alpha acids)
3.75 AAU Challenger hops (3 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 7.5% alpha acids)
4.25 AAU Northdown hops (3 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 8.5% alpha acids)
2.5 AAU East Kent Goldings hops (3 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 5% alpha acids)
Irish moss (15 min.)
White Labs WLP002 (English Ale) or Wyeast 1968 (London ESB Ale) yeast
1⁄3 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
I use Crisp Malting’s British Pale Ale malt (made from Maris Otter) as my base grain, but other malts of a similar nature should work well. Remember, the bulk of the flavor comes from the base grain, so try to get British pale ale malt. The crystal malt should also be of British origin as it makes a substantial difference. I have had great success with Simpsons and Bairds, but feel free to substitute any high quality malt of a similar flavor and color from a different supplier. My hops are in pellet form and come from the UK via Hop Union or Hopsteiner.

Mill the grains and dough-in targeting a mash of around 1.5 quarts of water to 1 pound of grain (a liquor-to-grist ratio of about 3:1 by weight) and a temperature of 148 °F (64 °C). Hold the mash at 148 °F (64 °C) until enzymatic conversion is complete. Infuse the mash with near-boiling water while stirring or with a recirculating mash system raise the temperature to mash out at 168 °F (76 °C). Sparge slowly with 170 °F (77 °C) water, collecting wort until the pre-boil kettle volume is around 5.9 gallons (22.3 L) and the gravity is 1.035.

Add the bittering hops once the wort is boiling, The total wort boil time is 1 hour. During that time add the Irish moss or other kettle finings with 15 minutes left in the boil and add the last hop additions with 3 minutes remaining. Chill the wort to 68 °F (20 °C) and aerate thoroughly. If you have a nice, fresh package of liquid yeast, you can pitch it direct, although making a 1-liter starter is always a good idea.

Ferment around 68 °F (20 °C) until the yeast drops clear. With healthy yeast, fermentation should be complete in a week or less. Allow the lees to settle and the brew to mature without pressure for another two days after fermentation appears finished. Rack to a keg and force carbonate or rack to a bottling bucket, add priming sugar, and bottle. Target a carbonation level

of 1–2 volumes depending on your packaging. If you are cask conditioning the beer, add priming sugar, any cask finings (gelatin or isinglass), and possibly dry hop with another 1/4–1/2 oz. (7–14 g) of whole East Kent Goldings. Allow the beer to condition in the cask for several days and serve via a beer engine or by gravity feed at 50–55 °F (10–13 °C).

(5 gallons/19 L, extract with grains)
OG = 1.042  FG = 1.011
IBU = 35  SRM = 9  ABV = 4.1%

Ingredients
5.4 lbs. (2.4 kg) English liquid malt extract
7 oz. (200 g) English crystal malt (75 °L)
5.5 AAU Target hops (60 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 11% alpha acids)
3.75 AAU Challenger hops (3 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 7.5% alpha acids)

2.5 AAU East Kent Goldings hops (3 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 5% alpha acids)
Irish moss (15 min.)
White Labs WLP002 (English Ale) or Wyeast 1968 (London ESB Ale) yeast
1⁄3 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
I use an English-type liquid malt extract custom made for my homebrew shop from a 100% Maris Otter malt. Both Muntons and Crisp offer a Maris Otter liquid malt extract as well. It is always best to choose the freshest extract that fits the beer style. The crystal malt should also be of British origin as it makes a substantial difference. I have had great success with Simpsons and Bairds, but feel free to substitute any high quality malt of a similar flavor and color from a different supplier. My hops are in pellet form and come from the UK via Hop Union or Hopsteiner.

Mill or coarsely crack the specialty malt and place loosely in a grain bag. Avoid packing the grains too tightly in the bag, using more bags if needed. Steep the bag in about 1 gallon (~4 liters) of water at roughly 170 °F (77 °C) for about 30 minutes. Lift the grain bag out of the steeping liquid and rinse with warm water. Allow the bags to drip into the kettle for a few minutes while you add the malt extract. Do not squeeze the bags. Add enough water to the steeping liquor and malt extract to make a pre-boil volume of 5.9 gallons (22.3 liters) and a gravity of 1.035. Stir thoroughly to help dissolve the extract and bring to a boil.

Once the wort is boiling, add the bittering hops. The total wort boil time is 1 hour after adding the bittering hops. During that time add the Irish moss or other kettle finings with 15 minutes left in the boil and the last hop additions with 3 minutes remaining. Chill the wort to 68 °F (20 °C) and aerate thoroughly. If you have a nice, fresh package of liquid yeast, you can pitch it direct, although making a 1-liter starter is always a good idea.

Ferment around 68 °F (20 °C) until the yeast drops clear. With healthy yeast, fermentation should be complete in a week or less. Allow the lees to settle and the brew to mature without pressure for another two days after fermentation appears finished. Rack to a keg and force carbonate or rack to a bottling bucket, add priming sugar, and bottle. Target a carbonation level of 1–2 volumes.

This beer has a nice bittersweet chocolate and coffee profile, with just enough hop presence to offset any cloying sweetness.

Ingredients
8.7 lbs. (4 kg) 2-row pale malt
1.2 lbs. (0.54 kg) crystal malt (15 °L)
1.1 lbs. (0.5 kg) Munich malt (10 °L)
15 oz. (0.42 kg) chocolate malt
2 oz. (57 g) Briess Midnight Wheat malt
3.9 AAU Galena hop pellets (60 min.) (0.3 oz./8.5 g at 13% alpha acids)
3.2 AAU Centennial hop pellets (30 min.) (0.3 oz./8.5 g at 10.5% alpha acids)
13.2 AAU Simcoe® hop pellets (0 min.) (1 oz./28 g at 13.2% alpha acids)
1⁄2 tsp. Irish moss (15 min.)
1⁄2 tsp. yeast nutrient (15 min.)
White Labs WLP001 (California Ale), Wyeast 1056 (American Ale), or Safale US-05 yeast
2⁄3 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step

This recipe is a single step infusion mash. Mix all of the crushed grains with 4 gallons (15 L) of 166 °F (74 °C) water to stabilize at 153 °F (67 °C). This is a medium mash using 1.4 quarts of strike water per pound of grain (2.9 L/kg). This ratio will help to reduce fermentability. A less fermentable wort is also created by the medium-high mash temperature. Slowly sparge with 175 °F (79 °C) water.

Collect approximately 6 gallons (23 L) of wort runoff. Boil for 60 minutes. While boiling, add the hops, Irish moss, and yeast nutrient as per the schedule. During the boil, use this time to thoroughly sanitize your fermentation equipment.

Once the boil is complete, cool the wort to 75 °F (24 °C) and transfer to your fermenter. Pitch the yeast and aerate the wort heavily. Allow the beer to cool to 68 °F (20 °C). Hold at that temperature until fermentation is complete. This may take 6–8 days. Gently transfer to a carboy, avoiding any splashing to prevent aerating the beer. Allow the beer to condition for an additional week. Prime and bottle condition or keg and force carbonate to 2.2 volumes CO2. Allow the beer to age for at least two more weeks to fully develop the flavors and enjoy your Liberty Ship Stout clone.

IBU = 17 SRM = 2.5 ABV = 4.5%

Dixie is an American Pilsner style beer, with adjunct levels a bit lower than most of "Grandpa’s beers." This extra maltiness gives a bit more robust flavor to it, and a slightly darker color. Its yeast flavor leans more toward the Pilsner style, but uses American hops so that their characteristic citrus flavor comes through.

Ingredients
2.5 lbs. (1.1 kg) light dried malt extract (such as Briess Golden Light)
3.0 lb. (1.4 kg) 6-row pale malt
1.0 lb. (0.45 kg) flaked rice
1.0 lb. (0.45 kg) flaked corn
3.75 AAU Cascade hop pellets (60 min) (0.75 oz./21 g of 5.0% alpha acid)
2.0 AAU Willamette hop pellets (0 min) (0.5 oz./14 g of 4.0% alpha acid)
1/2 teaspoon Irish moss (last 15 min)
White Labs WLP838 (Southern German Lager) or Wyeast 2124 (Bohemian Lager) yeast
0.75 cup (150 g) corn sugar for priming

Step by Step
Steep the crushed grains in 2 gallons (7.6 L) of water at 150°F (65 °C) for 60 minutes, stirring often. Rinse with 2 quarts (1.8 L) of 170 °F (77 °C) water. Add half the dried malt extract and water to make at least 3 gallons (11 L) and boil wort for 60 minutes, add the hops and Irish moss per the recipe schedule. For the last 5 minutes of the boil, add the remaining dried malt extract. Cool wort, transfer to fermenter and top up to 5.0 gallons (19 L). Pitch your yeast when the beer has cooled to 68 °F (20 °C), and aerate. Hold the beer at around 68 °F (20 °C) until the yeast starts fermenting, and then cool the beer to 52 °F (11 °C) for the remainder of the fermentation. About 3 days after hitting your final gravity, raise the temperature of the beer to about 68 °F (20 °C) for 3 days for a diacetyl rest. Transfer to secondary and lager the beer at about 35 °F (2 °C) for another 3 weeks before bottling or kegging this beer.

13 lbs. (5.9 kg) 2-row pale malt
6.4 oz. (0.18 kg) Thomas Fawcett amber malt (35 °L)
11.2 AAU Warrior® hops (60–35 min.) (0.7 oz./20 g at 16% alpha acids)
3.6 AAU Simcoe® hops (35–0 min.) (0.7 oz./20 g at 13% alpha acids)
5.6 AAU Amarillo® hops (35–0 min.) (0.7 oz./20 g at 8% alpha acids)
0.7 oz. (20 g) Amarillo® hops (0 min.)
1 oz. (28 g) Amarillo® hops (dry hop)
0.5 oz. (14 g) Simcoe® hops (dry hop)
0.5 oz. (14 g) Glacier hops (dry hop)
1 tsp. Irish moss (15 min.)
Wyeast 1187 (Ringwood Ale) or White Labs WLP005 (British Ale) yeast (1.5 qt./~1.5 L starter @ SG 1.030)
7/8 cup (175 g) dextrose (if priming)

Step by Step
Mash the grains at 152 °F (67 °C) for 60 minutes. Mash out, vorlauf, and then sparge at 170 °F (77 °C). Boil wort for 60 minutes. Begin hopping wort with a continuous stream of Warrior® hops at a rate of 0.28 oz. (7.9 g) per 10 minutes. Warrior® should run out with 35 minutes left in boil. Refill hopper with Simcoe® and Amarillo® hops and resume hopping until the end of the boil. Add Irish moss with 15 minutes remaining. Add the 0 minute hops after boil and begin cooling. Aerate cooled wort and pitch yeast. Ferment initially at 71 °F (22 °C), but let temperature rise to 74 °F (23 °C) towards the end of fermentation. Warm condition for 3 days (to remove diacetyl), then cool beer and add dry hops, allowing 10-14 days contact time. Bottle or keg as usual.

Partial mash option: Reduce the 2-row pale malt in the all-grain recipe to 1.5 lbs. (0.68 kg) and add 4 lbs. (1.8 kg) Muntons light dried malt extract and 2 lbs. 14 oz. (1.3 kg) Muntons light liquid malt extract. Steep crushed malt at 152 °F (67 °C) in 2.25 qts. (2.1 L) of water. After 45 minutes, rinse grains with 1 qt. (1 L) of 170 °F (77 °C) water. Add water to "grain tea" to make 4 gallons (15 L). To save time, heat 3.5 gallons/13 L of water during "steep." Stir in the dried malt extract and bring to a boil. During the boil, do not let wort volume drop below 3.5 gallons (13 L). Add boiling water if wort volume dips near this mark. Follow the hopping schedule in the all-grain version, adding the liquid malt extract with 15 mintues remaining in the boil. Follow the remaining portion of the all-grain recipe.

Dogfish Head Brewing Co. Shelter Pale Ale clone
(5 gallons/ 19 L, extract with grain)
OG = 1.052 FG = 1.013
IBU = 30 SRM = 9  ABV = 5.0 %

Ingredients
6.6 lbs. (3.0 kg) Briess light, unhopped, malt extract
7.0 oz. (198 g) light dried malt extract
6.0 oz. (170 g) crystal malt (120 °L)
2.0 oz. (57 g) amber malt (35 ºL) (substitute dark Munich or carastan if needed)
1⁄2 tsp. Irish moss (15 min.)
8 AAU Warrior hops (60 min.) (0.5 oz./ 14 g of 16% alpha acid)
2.75 AAU Glacier hops (10 min.) (0.5 oz./ 14 g of 5.5% alpha acid)
6.5 AAU Simcoe hops (0 min.) (0.5 oz./ 14 g of 13% alpha acid)
White Labs WLP 005 (British Ale) or Wyeast 1187 (Ringwood Ale) yeast
0.75 cup (150g) corn sugar (for priming)

Step by Step
Steep the crushed grain in 1 gallon (3.8 L) of water at 155 ºF (68 ºC) for 30 minutes. Remove grains from the wort and rinse with 1 quart (0.9 L) of hot water. Add 1.5 gallons (5.7 L) of water plus the liquid and dry malt extracts and bring to a boil. While boiling, add the hops as per the hopping schedule. Add the yeast nutrient and Irish moss after 45 minutes of boiling. Now add the wort to two gallons (7.6 L) of cold water in the sanitized fermenter and top off with cold water up to five gallons (19 L).

Cool the wort to 75 ºF (24 ºC). Pitch your yeast and aerate the wort heavily. Allow the beer to cool to 68 ºF (20 ºC). Hold at that temperature until fermentation is complete. Transfer to a carboy, avoiding any splashing to prevent aerating the beer. Let the beer condition for one week and then bottle or keg. Allow to carbonate and condition for two additional weeks and enjoy your Shelter Pale Ale.

All-Grain Option:
This is a single step infusion mash. Replace the liquid malt extract and dried extract with 10.75 lbs. (4.9 kg) 2-row pale malt grain. The specialty grains remain the same. Mix the crushed grain with 4.5 gallons (17 L) of 172 °F (78 °C) water to stabilize at 155 ºF (68 ºC) for 60 minutes. Sparge slowly with 175 ºF (79 ºC) water. Collect approximately 6.0 gallons (23 L) of wort runoff to boil for 60 minutes. Reduce the bittering hop amount to 0.4 oz. (11 g) to allow for the higher utilization factor of a full wort boil. The remaining instructions for this recipe are the same as the extract with grain recipe.

90 Minute IPA was the first beer that Dogfish Head brewed using their continuous hopping technique of adding hops throughout the boil. Esquire magazine has called it "perhaps the best IPA in America."

Ingredients
16 lbs. (7.3 kg) 2-row pale malt
1.5 lbs. (0.68 kg) dark Munich malt (20 °L)
16 AAU Amarillo® hops (90–0 min.) (2 oz./57 g at 8% alpha acids)
8 AAU Simcoe® hops (90–0 min.) (0.62 oz./17 g at 13% alpha acids)
8 AAU Warrior® hops (90–0 min.) (0.53 oz./15 g at 15% alpha acids)
1 oz. (28 g) Amarillo® hops (dry hop)
0.5 oz. (14 g) Simcoe® hops (dry hop)
0.5 oz. (14 g) Glacier hops (dry hop)
1 tsp. Irish moss (15 min.)
Wyeast 1187 (Ringwood Ale) or Safale S-04 yeast
3⁄4 cups corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Mash in at 122 °F (50 °C), then raise the temperature to 149 °F (65 °C) until conversion is complete. Mash out at 170 °F (77 °C). Boil the wort for 95 minutes. Starting with 90 minutes left in the boil, begin slowly and evenly adding hops to the kettle. (This works out to a little over 0.25 oz. (7 g) of hops every 7.5 minutes.) Start fermentation at 70 °F (21 °C) and let raise to 72 °F (22 °C). Dry hop in secondary at 71 °F for 3–5 days, then cool to 32 °F (0 °C). Bottle or keg as normal.

Partial mash option: Reduce the 2-row malt in the all-grain recipe to 1.75 lbs. (0.8 kg) and add 7.6 lbs. (3.45 kg) extra light dried malt extract. Steep crushed grains in 1.1 gallons (4 L) of water at 150 °F (66 °C) for 45 minutes, then remove grains and wash with 1 gallon (3.8 L) hot water. Top off the brewpot to 7 gallons (26.5 L) and add all the dried malt extract. Boil the wort for 105 minutes. Starting with 90 minutes left in the boil, begin slowly and evenly adding hops to the kettle. (This works out to a little over 0.25 oz./7 g of hops every 7.5 minutes.) Start fermentation at 71 °F (22 °C) and let raise to 74 °F (23 °C). Dry hop in secondary at 71 °F for 3–5 days, then cool to 32 °F (0 °C). Bottle or keg as normal.

Dogfish Head Craft Brewery’s Burton Baton clone
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.088 FG = 1.016
IBU = 65 SRM = 11 ABV = 9.5%

Ingredients
15 lbs. (6.8 kg) pale ale malt
0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) crystal malt (60 °L)
0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) honey malt
0.2 lb. (90 g) amber malt
1 lb. (0.45 kg) corn sugar (10 min.)
15.2 AAU Warrior® hops (60–30 min.) (1 oz./28 g at 15.2% alpha acids)
9.5 AAU Simcoe® hops (30–15 min.) (0.75 oz./21 g at 12.6% alpha acids)
4.1 AAU Palisade® hops (15–0 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 8.2% alpha acids)
14.4 AAU Palisade® hops (0 min.) (1.75 oz./50 g at 8.2% alpha acids)
2.1 oz. (60 g) Simcoe® hops (dry hop)
2.9 oz. (80 g) Amarillo® hops (dry hop)
1.4 oz. (40 g) Palisade® hops (dry hop)
1.1 oz. (30 g) American medium-toast oak chips (optional)
Wyeast 1098 (British Ale) or White Labs WLP007 (Dry English Ale) or Lallemand Nottingham yeast
3⁄4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Mill the grains, then mix with 5.1 gallons (19.2 L) of hot strike water to achieve a single infusion rest temperature of 155 °F (68 °C). Adjust mash pH to 5.3–5.4 using lactic acid, if needed. Hold at this temperature for 60 minutes. Mashout to 170 °F (77 °C) if desired.

Vorlauf until your runnings are clear before directing them to your boil kettle. Batch or fly sparge the mash and run-off to obtain 6.5 gallons (25 L) of wort. Boil for 60 minutes. Add the Warrior® incrementally from 60–30 minutes, then add the Simcoe® incrementally from 30–15 minutes, and finally, add Palisade® incrementally from 15 minutes to the end of the boil. Also, at 15 minutes left in boil, you may want to add either Irish moss or Whirlfloc as fining agents. At 10 minutes left, add the corn sugar.

After the boil, add the flameout hops indicated and whirlpool for 10 minutes before rapidly chilling the wort to 63 °F (17 °C). Oxygenate with pure oxygen and pitch a healthy count of yeast. Allow the beer to free-rise to 68 °F (20 °C).

Once primary fermentation is complete, dry hop with all three varieties. After 3 days, drop the temperature to 55 °F (13 °C) and after 24 hours, rack the beer to secondary. If oaking, add it now (1.1 oz./30 g of medium-toast American oak) and age for 14 days. Bottle or keg the beer and carbonate to approximately 2.5 volumes.

Tips for Success:
Mark Sarfarik, Dogfish Head’s Brewmaster, provided us with all the juicy details about this beer. "Burton Baton is a 10% ABV imperial IPA that is a blend of 90 Minute IPA with an English old ale that is aged in our 10,000-gallon (380-hL) oak foeders. Since most people don’t have the ability to wood-age beers at home, this recipe is more of a composite of the two threads." In addition, Mark conferred several additional tips for the beer. First off, the dry-hop timeline for the beer should be no more than 3–4 days as extended aging can result in harsh, tannic-type flavors. With the majority of dry hopping protocols, most of the magic is really accomplished in the first 72 hours. Secondly, DFH’s oak foeders are fairly neutral so they’re more interested in the oxidative character that oak aging brings. To this end, Mark suggested the addition of the honey malt to drive a bit of that toffee sweetness. Finally, the water profile at the brewery is fairly soft with only 20 ppm calcium. Through additions, they arrive at ~70 ppm of calcium and during the mash you should be striving for a pH between 5.3 and 5.4.

Mark adds, "this is a very high-gravity fermentation, so oxygen rather than air is recommended for wort aeration. Pitching double the normal amount of yeast is highly recommended." If you have trouble finding Palisade®, Willamette is a good substitute, or if Warrior® isn’t available, any high alpha-acid bittering hop should suffice. Another unique technique DFH uses is called continually hopping. It means that small charges of hops are added roughly every minute or so. "This can be emulated at home by dividing each variety up into manageable, small quantities and spreading the addition out over the times indicated in the hopping schedule."

Dogfish Head Craft Brewing's Indian Brown clone
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.070 FG = 1.016
IBU = 50 SRM = 18 ABV = 7.2%

This dark IPA is available year-round and is dry hopped similarly to Dogfish Head’s 60 Minute and 90 Minute IPAs. It is roasty, with a mild hop bitterness.

Ingredients
10.75 lbs. (4.88 kg) Pilsner malt
15.2 oz. (0.43 kg) flaked maize
10.9 oz. (0.31 kg) amber malt
10.8 oz. (0.31 kg) crystal malt (60 °L)
6.5 oz. (0.18 kg) coffee malt
2.2 oz. (62 g) roasted barley
6 oz. (0.17 kg) dark brown sugar
11.5 AAU Warrior® hops (60-10 min.) (0.72 oz./20 g of 16% alpha acids)
6 AAU Golding hops (10-0 min.) (1.2 oz./34 g of 5% alpha acids)
6 AAU Liberty hops (0 min.) (1.33 oz./38 g of 4.5% alpha acids)
1 oz. (28 g) Amarillo® hops (dry hop)
0.5 oz. (14 g) Simcoe® hops (dry hop)
0.5 oz. (14 g) Glacier hops (dry hop)
White Labs WLP005 (British Ale) or Wyeast 1187 (Ringwood Ale) yeast
3/4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Mix a half a cup of water to the brown sugar a slowly caramelize the sugar in a small pot. Be sure not to scorch. Mash the grains at 152 °F (67 °C) in 3.75 gallons (14 L) of water. Vorlaf until your runnings are clear, sparge, add the caramelized sugar and then boil the wort for 60 minutes. Begin hopping the wort with a continuous stream of Warrior® hops. When you run out of Warrior hops, refill hopper with Golding hops and resume hopping until the end of the boil. Add the 0 minute hops after boil and stir wort to create a whirlpool. Allow wort to settle for 15 minutes then begin cooling. Aerate cooled wort and pitch yeast. Ferment at 70 °F (21 °C). Add the dry hops after final gravity is reached, and leave them in contact with the beer for three to five days. Bottle or keg as usual.

Partial mash option: Scale the Pilsner malt down to 1 lb. (0.45 kg). Add 1.25 lbs. (0.57 kg) Muntons Light dried malt extract and 5.25 lbs (2.3 kg) Muntons Light liquid malt extract (late addition). Omit the flaked maze and add 15.2 oz. (0.43 kg) brewers corn syrup. In your brew pot, add just enough water to the brown sugar to dissolve it. Heat to a boil and caramelize sugar (without scorching it). Then, add 4.3 qts. (4.1 L) of water to your brew pot and heat to 163 °F (73 °C). Place the crushed grains in a steeping bag and steep grains at around 152 °F (67 °C) for 45 minutes. During the steep, heat 3.2 qts. (3.1 L) of rinse water to 170 °F (77 °C) in a separate pot. After steep, rinse grains, add water to make at least 2.5 gallons (9.5 L) of "grain tea" (wort) and bring to a boil. Add dried malt extract and corn syrup and boil for 60 minutes, adding hops as indicated in the all-grain recipe. Add liquid malt extract with 15 minutes left in boil. Cool wort and transfer to fermenter. Top up to 5 gallons (19 L) with water, aerate, and pitch the yeast. Follow the remainder of the all-grain recipe.

Abysmal Stout (Bourbon "Barrel" Aged)
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.096FG = 1.020
IBU =40SRM = 66ABV = 11.5%

Ingredients
15 lbs. (6.8 kg) Golden PromiseTM malt
1.5 lbs. (0.68 kg) kiln coffee malt (150 °L)
1 lb. (0.45 kg) Briess Midnight Wheat malt
1 lb. (0.45 kg) crystal rye malt (75 °L)
0.75 lb. (0.34 kg) crystal malt (60 °L)
0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) Victory® malt
2 lbs. (0.9 kg) extra dark candi syrup (primary)
6.5 AAU Nugget hops (60 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 13% alpha acids)
6.5 AAU Nugget hops (30 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 13% alpha acids)
1 oz. (28 g) licorice root (15 min.)
1 vanilla bean (primary)
2 oz. (57 g) Bourbon-soaked American white oak cubes
Imperial A10 (Darkness) or Wyeast 1084 (Irish Ale) or Lallemand Nottingham yeast
3⁄4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Soak the charred cubes starting on brew day in Bourbon or rye of your choosing (mid-shelf). Mash in the grains with 6.2 gallons (23.4 L)
of 164 °F (73 °C) strike water to achieve a mash temperature of 150 °F (66 °C). Hold this temperature for at least 60 minutes, then begin mashout process. Collect 7.5 gallons (28 L) of wort. Total boil time is 2 hours. Add hops and licorice root as indicated. You may want to add a yeast nutrient as well to give the yeast an extra boost to help finish fermentation.

Chill the wort, aerate, and pitch the yeast. Try to hold fermentation at around 68 °F (20 °C) but be careful that internal fermentation temperatures may be quite a bit higher than ambient temperature. Once fermentation begins to die down, add the candi syrup and chopped vanilla bean.

When your beer is ready for transferring into secondary (about 3–4 weeks), pour the liquor off the oak cubes (reserving for cocktails!) and place cubes into the vessel. Rack the beer on top of the cubes. Big stouts like this are often best with considerable age, after many months (minimum of 2 months) of aging to allow the oak and intense flavors to meld together, while the sometimes hot alcohol character of a fresh beer smooths out. Consider a January brew day for a Christmas beer release. If time does not allow for such a long aging, decrease the quantity of oak used or switch to an oak alternative with a shorter extraction time.

Dogfish Head’s Kvasir clone
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.087 FG = 1.011
IBU = 18 SRM = ~23 ABV = 10.4%

Ingredients
7 lbs. (3.2 kg) wheat malt
5.5 lbs. (2.5 kg) Maris Otter malt
0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) caramel malt (40 °L)
0.3 gallons (1.1 L) preservative free cranberry juice (10 min.)
0.7 lb. (0.32 kg) birch syrup (10 min.)
2 lbs. (0.9 kg) honey (10 min.)
0.25 oz. (7 g) meadowsweet (5 min.)
0.1 oz. (3 g) yarrow (5 min.)
10 oz. (283 g) Myrica gale (5 min.)
0.6 lb. (0.27 kg) fresh or frozen lingonberries (0 min.)
0.3 lb. (0.14 kg) fresh cranberries (0 min.)
~5 drops pectinase enzyme
2.64 AAU Hallertau, Spalt or Tettnang hops (0.6 oz./17 g at 4.4% alpha acids) (60 min.)
0.8 AAU Hallertau, Spalt or Tettnang hops (0.18 oz./5 g at 4.4% alpha acids) (10 min.)
White Labs WLP011 (European Ale) or Wyeast 1087 (Bohemian Ale Blend) yeast

Step by step

24 to 48 hours before brewing: Crush the lingonberries and cranberries in 0.5 gallons (1.9 L) of water and treat with pectinase per the manufacturer’s instructions.

Heat 4.5 gallons (17 L) of water to 166 °F (74 °C). Mash the grains at 153 °F (67 °C) and hold for 60 minutes. After conversion is complete, start the lauter process. Sparge with just enough water to collect about 6 gallons (23 L) of wort in the brew kettle. Total boil time is 60 minutes. At 50 minutes into the boil add the birch syrup, honey, and cranberry juice and the second hop addition. With 5 minute remaining in the boil add the meadowsweet, yarrow, and Myrica gale.

After 60 minutes have elapsed, turn off the heat, add the lingonberry – cranberry mixture. Give the wort a long stir to create a whirlpool and let the mixture sit for 15 minutes. Chill the wort to 62 °F (17 °C) and transfer to a sanitized fermenter. Try to leave most of the fruit behind, there should be about 5 gallons (19 L) of wort in the fermenter. Pitch the yeast. Ferment at 62 °F (17 °C). After primary fermentation has completed, rack to secondary fermenter and mature for at least 21 days. Bottle or keg and enjoy.

Extract with grains option:
Replace all wheat malt and 5 lbs. (2.3 kg) of the Maris Otter pale ale malt with 7 lbs. Bavarian Wheat dried malt extract. Preheat 1.5 gallons (5.7 L) of water to 154 °F (68 °C). Place the caramel and Maris Otter malt in a steeping bag in the water. Steep the grains at 153 °F (67 °C) and hold for 15 minutes. In a second vessel, heat approximately 1 gallon (3.8 L) of water to 175 °F (79 °C) for rinsing. After the steeping time has elapsed, place the steeping bag with malt into a colander and let it drain into the brewpot. Rinse the grains with the 175 °F (79 °C) water and increase the heat. At 200 °F (93 °C) mix in the dried malt extract and raise to a boil. Add the first hop addition at the start of the boil. Boil time is 60 minutes. Follow the remainder of the all-grain recipe.

RPB's Doodle
RPB's Doodle
(5 gallon/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.052 FG = 1.022
IBU = 3 SRM = 10 ABV = 4%

One of the fun things about the RPB is the ability to brew very unique beers. This recipe is Brewmaster Rod Read’s attempt to brew a beer that tastes like a snickerdoodle cookie.

Ingredients
7.75 lbs. (3.5 kg) 2-row pale malt
3.25 lbs. (1.5 kg) Briess Victory® malt
0.1 oz. (3 g) Saaz hop pellets (60 min.)
3.5 oz. (10 g) ground cinnamon (5 min.)
Wyeast 2035 (American Lager) or White Labs WLP840 (American Lager) yeast
1⁄2 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Ramp the mash temperature through conversion. You will probably want a very short or high temperature mash in order to conserve residual starches and help the breadiness (58% RDF).

Boil the wort for 60 minutes adding just a few hops at the beginning of the boil.

Cold ferment the wort at 50 °F (10 °C) for 7–14 days or until the gravity stabilizes. Chill to 45 °F (7 °C) over 24 hours to drop yeast, then bottle or keg. Add corn sugar (if priming) and bottle or keg as normal.

Tips for Success:
Fresh Victory® malt will help give that biscuity/bready note that you need to accentuate the "cookie-ness". We added the hops just to control the boil, but not for bittering.

Fermentation should take seven days at 50 °F (10 °C) with no mat-uration time (you want elevated diacetyl to give a buttery aroma, reminiscent of a cookie). A-B packaged Doodle unfiltered with low CO2 (2.3%v/v).

Doppelbockinator
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.091 FG = 1.023
IBU = 24 SRM = 18 ABV = 9.7%

Ingredients
13 lbs. (5.9 kg) Munich malt (6 °L)
3.2 lbs. (1.45 kg) continental Pilsner malt
3.2 lbs. (1.45 kg) Goldpils® Vienna malt (3.5 °L)
9 oz. (255 g) caramel Munich malt (60 °L)
2 oz. (57 g) Blackprinz® malt
4.5 AAU Hallertauer Hersbrucker hops (60 min.) (1 oz./28 g at 4.5% alpha acids)
4.5 AAU Hallertauer Hersbrucker hop pellets (5 min.) (1 oz./28 g at 4.5% alpha acids)
1⁄2 tsp. yeast nutrient (15 min.)
White Labs WLP833 (German Bock Lager) or Wyeast 2206 (Bavarian Lager) yeast
3⁄4 cup corn sugar (if priming)
Lallemand CBC-1 yeast (if priming)

Step by Step
It is recommended to brew a smaller lager and use the yeast cake from that beer to pitch into this beer. See "Tips for Success."

On brew day, mix the milled grain in 5.75 gallons (22 L) of water and hold the mash at 154 ºF (67 ºC) for 60 minutes. Slowly sparge with enough water to collect 7 gallons (26.5 L) wort. Total boil time is 90 minutes. Add the first hop addition with 60 minutes remaining in the boil. Add the remaining hops and yeast nutrient per the schedule.

After the boil is complete, cool the wort to 50 ºF (10 ºC). Pitch your yeast and aerate the wort heavily. Ferment at 55 ºF (13 ºC) until primary fermentation is complete. Gently transfer to a secondary vessel. If required perform a diacetyl rest. Lager for 6 weeks at 48 ºF (9 ºC). Prime and bottle condition or keg and force carbonate to 2.5 volumes CO2. We recommend priming with a bottling yeast strain like Lallemand CBC-1.

Ingredients
9.9 lbs. (4.5 kg) Munich liquid malt extract
2 lbs. (0.91 kg) Pilsen dried malt extract
9 oz. (255 g) caramel Munich malt (60 °L)

Step by Step
It is recommended to brew a smaller lager and use the yeast cake from that beer to pitch into this beer. See "Tips for Success."

On brew day, place the crushed grains in a small muslin bag. Steep the milled grain in 2 gallons (7.6 L) of water at 160 ºF (71 ºC) for 20 minutes. Remove the grain bag and place in a colander. Wash with 2 qts. (2 L) hot water. Add the liquid and dried malt extract and stir until fully dissolved. Top off to 6 gallons (23 L) and bring to a boil. When the wort comes to a boil, add first hop addition. Add the remaining hops and yeast nutrient per the schedule.

After the boil is complete, cool the wort to 50 ºF (10 ºC). Pitch your yeast and aerate the wort heavily. Ferment at 55 ºF (13 ºC) until primary fermentation is complete. Gently transfer to a secondary vessel. If required, perform a diacetyl rest. Lager for 6 weeks at 48 ºF (9 ºC). Prime and bottle condition or keg and force carbonate to 2.5 volumes CO2. We recommend pitching a bottling yeast strain like Lallemand CBC-1 to help the primary yeast strain properly carbonate the beer with a high gravity beer like this.

Tips for Success:
The recommended pitch rate for a beer of this size — according to Mr. Malty (www.mrmalty.com) — is 616 billion cells, which would be about a 2-gallon (7.6-L) yeast starter. Your best bet is to get your yeast starter going a couple of days ahead of time so you can decant the liquid. Or better yet, step the yeast up from a low-gravity "small" beer in order to create enough healthy yeast cells for this high-gravity beer.

(5 gallons/19 L), extract with grain)
OG = 1.052 FG = 1.012
IBU = 24 SRM = 6 ABV = 5.2%

Ingredients
6.6 lbs. (3 kg) Pilsen light liquid malt extract
0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) carapils or dextrin malt
0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) crystal malt (20° Lovibond)
5.6 AAU Tettnang hops (60 min.) (1.25 oz./35 g at 4.5% alpha acids)
1.75 AAU Hallertau hops (15 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 3.5% alpha acids)
2 pt. starter of Munich or German lager yeast (Wyeast 2308, White Labs WLP830 or equivalent)
3/4 cup corn sugar for priming

Step by Step
Steep crushed grain in 5 gallons (19 L) of 150 °F (66 °C) water for 30 minutes. Sparge grains with enough hot water to make 5.5 gallons (21 L). Heat to boiling and add malt extract. Total boil will be 60 minutes. At beginning of boil, add Tettnang hops and continue for 45 minutes. Add Hallertau and boil remaining 15 minutes. Whirlpool and cool to 50 °F (10 °C) to pitch starter. Oxygenate-aerate well. Ferment at 50 °F (10 °C) for 7 days, transfer to secondary and warm to 55 °F (13 °C). Ferment for 7 more days or until gravity is about 1.012 and fermentation stops. Cool to 40 °F (4 °C) for 3 more days. Keg or rack, prime and bottle condition at 50 °F (10 °C) for 2-3 weeks before drinking.

All-Grain Option:
Omit the extract syrup and mash 9.5 lbs. (4.3 kg) German Pilsner malt (such as Durst, BestMalz or Weyermann) along with the other grains in 4 gallons (15 L) of 150 °F (66 °C) water for 60 minutes. Sparge with enough 168 °F water to collect 6.5 gallons (24.6 L) of wort. Total boil time is 90 minutes. Add a pinch of the Tettnang at start of boil and the remainder with 60 minutes remaining. After 75 minutes of boiling, add Hallertau and a kettle fining if you so desire. Proceed as above for fermentation.

OG = 1.057 (14.4°P) FG = 1.012 (3.1°P)
IBU = 30 SRM = 7 ABV = 5.6%

The midwestern part of the United States has become chock-a-block with incredible breweries, but Great Lakes Brewing Company is easily near the top of that list in my opinion. Here was my attempt to re-create their Dortmunder Gold, a true standard in the field.

Ingredients
11 lbs (5.0 kg) North American 2-row malt
0.33 lbs. (0. 15 kg) crystal malt (60 °L)
1.5 AAU Magnum hops (90 min.) (0.1 oz./3 g at 14.5% alpha acids)
4.8 AAU Cascade (15 min.) (0.83 oz./23 g at 5.75% alpha acids)
8.4 AAU Hallertauer Mittelfreuh (0 min.) (1.7 oz./46 g at 5.25% alpha acids)
White Labs WLP830 (German Lager) or Wyeast 2124 (Bohemian Lager) yeast (3 qt./3 L yeast starter) or Saflager S-23 (2 sachets)
3/4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Mash in at 152 °F (67 °C) for 40 minutes. Sparge to collect ~6.5 gallons (25 L) in your kettle to achieve 5.25 gallons (20 L) at knockout. Boil for a grand total of 90 minutes. Just after knockout, toss in the knockout hops and begin whirlpool. You can either run your pump for 10 minutes or stir for a minute and then let spin down and settle. After 30 minutes have gone past after knockout, cool the wort down to 45 °F (7.2 °C) and pitch a healthy dose of yeast into fermenter. Keep fermentation temperatures within recommended temperature. After final gravity has been achieved, add clarifying agent such as polyclar. Allow three day for clarifying agent to settle, then either transfer into a keg or bottle. Try your best to keep oxygen at bay during the racking or bottling process.

(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.085 FG = 1.018
IBU = 100+ SRM = 33 ABV = 9.3%

Ingredients
13.2 lbs. (6 kg) North American pale malt (2 °L)
1.1 lbs. (0.46 kg) crystal malt (40 °L)
14.1 oz. (0.4 kg) huskless black malt (500 °L)
1.7 lbs. (0.75 kg) dextrose (5 min.)
34 AAU Columbus pellet hops (60 min.) (2 oz./57 g at 17% alpha acids)
1 oz. (28 g) Columbus pellet hops (0 min.)
1 oz. (28 g) Amarillo® pellet hops (0 min.)
1 oz. (28 g) Simcoe® pellet hops (0 min.)
2 oz. (57 g) Amarillo® pellet hops (dry hop)
2 oz. (57 g) Simcoe® pellet hops (dry hop)
Irish moss (15 min.)
White Labs WLP001 (California Ale), Wyeast 1056 (American Ale) or Safale US-05 yeast
3⁄4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Mill the grains and dough-in targeting a mash of around 1.5 quarts of water to 1 pound of grain (a liquor-to-grist ratio of about 3:1 by weight) and a temperature of 149 °F (65 °C). Hold the mash at 149 °F (65 °C) until enzymatic conversion is complete. Infuse the mash with near-boiling water while stirring or, with a recirculating mash system, raise the temperature to mash out at 168 °F (76 °C). Sparge slowly with 170 °F (77 °C) water, collecting wort until the pre-boil kettle volume is around 6.5 gallons (25 L) and the gravity is 1.055.

The total wort boil time is 90 minutes. The first hop addition comes with 60 minutes remaining in the boil. Add Irish moss or other kettle finings and the dextrose as per the schedule. Add the second hop additions at flame out. Chill the wort to 67 °F (19 °C) and aerate thoroughly. The proper pitch rate is 3 packages of liquid yeast or 1 package of liquid yeast in a 4.5-liter (1-gallon) starter.

Ferment at 67 °F (19 °C) until the yeast drops clear. At this temperature and with healthy yeast, fermentation should be complete in about one week. Allow the lees to settle and add the dry hops. You can first transfer the beer to a second vessel, if you prefer, but the dry hopping should be carried out at around 60-65 °F (16-18 °C) for about a week. Then rack to a keg and force carbonate or rack to a bottling bucket, add priming sugar, and bottle. Target a carbonation level of 2.5 volumes.

3⁄4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
For most extract beers, I use ultra-light extract made by Alexander’s (California Concentrate Company), but any fresh, high quality light color extract will work well. Always choose the freshest extract that fits the beer style. If you cannot get fresh liquid malt extract, it is better to use an appropriate amount of dried malt extract instead. My crystal malt comes from Great Western. I use Briess Blackprinz® when I need huskless black malt. Feel free to substitute any high quality malt of a similar flavor and color from a different supplier. My hops are in pellet form and come from Hop Union, Hopsteiner, or Crosby Hop Farm depending on the variety.

Mill or coarsely crack the specialty malt and place loosely in a grain bag. Avoid packing the grains too tightly in the bag, using more bags if needed. Steep the bag in about 1.5 gallons (~6 liters) of water at 165 °F (74 °C). After about 30 to 60 minutes, lift the grain bag out of the steeping liquid and rinse with warm water. Allow the bags to drip into the kettle for a few minutes while you add the malt extract. Do not squeeze the bags. Add enough water to the steeping liquor and malt extract to make a pre-boil volume of 5.9 gallons (22.3 L) and a gravity of 1.060. Stir thoroughly to help dissolve the extract and bring to a boil.

The total wort boil time is 60 minutes. Add the first hop addition once the wort starts boiling. Add Irish moss or other kettle finings and the dextrose as per the schedule. Add the second hop additions at flame out. Chill the wort to 67 °F (19 °C) and aerate thoroughly. The proper pitch rate is 3 packages of liquid yeast or 1 package of liquid yeast in a 4.5-liter (1-gallon) starter. Follow the fermentation and packaging instructions for the all-grain version.

Add Perle (bittering) hops, Irish moss and boil for 60 minutes. Add the Hallertauer aroma hops for the last 10 minutes of the boil.

When done boiling, add wort to 2 gallons (7.6 L) cool water in a sanitary fermenter and top off with cool water to 5.5 gallons (20.9 L). Cool the wort to 80 ºF (27 ºC), aerate the beer and pitch your yeast. Allow the beer to cool over the next few hours to 68–70 ºF (20–21 ºC) and hold at these cooler temperatures until the yeast has fermented completely. Bottle your beer, age for two to three weeks and enjoy!

All-grain option:
This is a two-step mash. Your grain bill will be 7 lbs. (3.2 kg) of pale 2-row malt, 3 lbs. (1.4 kg) of wheat malt, and 0.5 lbs. (0.2 kg) of Munich malt. Mash in your grains at 122 ºF (50 ºC) for 30 minutes, then raise the temperature to 149 ºF (65 ºC) for 60 minutes. Collect enough wort to boil for 90 minutes and have a 5.5-gallon (20.9-L) yield. Lower the amount of Perle boiling hops to 0.75 oz. (21 grams) to account for higher extraction ratio of a full boil. The remainder of the recipe is the same as the extract.

Step by Step
Mill the grains, then mix with 7.9 gallons (29.9 L) of 167 °F (75 °C) strike water to achieve a single infusion rest temperature of 152 °F (67 °C). Hold at this temperature for 60 min. Mashout to 170 °F (77 °C). Vorlauf until your runnings are clear before directing them to your boil kettle. Batch or fly sparge the mash to obtain 6.5 gallons (25 L) of wort. Boil for 60 minutes, adding hops at the times indicated. At 15 minutes left in boil, add either Irish moss or Whirlfloc as fining agents.

After the boil, rapidly chill the wort to slightly below fermentation temperature, which is 69 °F (20 °C) for this beer. Pitch yeast.

Maintain fermentation temperature to avoid excessive esters and fusel alcohol production. Age the beer for 3–4 months in a Bourbon barrel. If you’re using other higher surface area to volume sources of oak, you’ll need to decrease the contact time to avoid over-oaking the beer.

Russian Imperial Stout
(5 gallons/19 L, extract with grains)
OG = 1.111 FG = 1.028
IBU = 52 SRM = 67 ABV = 13%

Ingredients
7 lbs. (3.2 kg) extra light dried malt extract
2 lbs. (0.91 kg) rye liquid malt extract
1.25 lbs. (0.57 kg) chocolate malt
1.25 lbs. (0.57 kg) chocolate rye malt
1.25 lbs. (0.57 kg) honey malt
1.25 lbs. (0.57 kg) roasted barley
1 lb. (0.45 kg) crystal malt (120 °L)
17 AAU Columbus hops (60 min.) (1 oz./28 g at 17% alpha acids)
Wyeast 1028 (London Ale) or White Labs WLP013 (London Ale) or Lallemand Nottingham yeast

Step by Step
Bring 5 gallons (19 L) of water to ~155 °F (68 °C). Steep all your milled, bagged grains for 15 minutes before removing them. Then add all the extract while stirring and stir until completely dissolved. Top up kettle to 6.5 gallons (25 L) then bring to a boil. Boil for 60 minutes, adding hops at the times indicated. At 15 minutes left in boil, add either Irish moss or Whirlfloc as fining agents.

After the boil, rapidly chill the wort to slightly below fermentation temperature, which is 69 °F (20 °C) for this beer. Pitch yeast.

Maintain fermentation temperature to avoid excessive esters and fusel alcohol production. Age the beer for 3–4 months in a Bourbon barrel. If you’re using other higher surface area to volume sources of oak, you’ll need to decrease the contact time to avoid over-oaking the beer.

Tips for Success:
Before adding any hops, you should sanitize the wort via boiling for several minutes. That will give the L. brevis a clean, uncompetitive slate to work on. Feel free to use 88% lactic acid to adjust the pH if needed. Speaking of pH, if you don’t have a pH meter, now may be the time to make the investment. Many are user-friendly and relatively inexpensive and can transform your brew day. In addition, you can use them for other fermented products.

The next aspect is the barrel-aged stout. If using staves or cubes, the contact time will need to be decreased. Start tasting every other day after a couple of weeks to prevent too much oaky, woody, tannic character from creeping in. Finally, AtG uses a ratio of one-part RIS to four-parts soured ale. Depending on the character of each of your two beers you may find a different ratio is more palatable.

IBU = 20 SRM = 15 ABV = 6.5%

Ingredients
5.7 lbs. (2.6 kg) pale liquid malt extract
1.8 lbs. (0.82 kg) dark liquid malt extract
0.5 lbs. (0.23 kg) table sugar (sucrose)
0.5 lbs. (0.23 kg) corn sugar (glucose)
5.6 AAU Styrian Goldings hops (bittering) (0.8 oz./23 g of 7% alpha acid)
0.5 oz. (14 g) Saaz hops (flavor)

Dubbel Halo Ale
(5 gallons/19 L, all grain)
OG = 1.064 FG = 1.011
IBU = 20 SRM = 15 ABV = 6.6%

Ingredients
10.75 lbs. (4.9 kg) pale 2-row Pils malt
0.5 lb. (0.22 kg) crystal malt (120 °L)
0.5 lbs. (0.23 kg) table sugar (sucrose)
0.5 lbs. (0.23 kg) corn sugar (glucose)
5.6 AAU Styrian Goldings hops (bittering) (0.8 oz./23 g of 7% alpha acid)
0.5 oz. (14 g) Saaz hops (flavor)
0.5 oz. (14 g) Tettnanger hops (aroma)
1 tsp. Irish moss
Wyeast 1388 (Belgian Strong Ale) or White Labs WLP500 (Trappist Ale) (primary fermentation)
Wyeast 1762 (Belgian Abbey II) or White Labs WLP530 (Abbey) (conditioning)
1 cup table or corn sugar (for priming)

Step by Step
The grain bill for this brew and the resulting color values have been calculated for a system with a hypothetical extract efficiency of roughly 65%. One pound of sugar is assumed to contribute about 10 to 13 gravity points to 5 gallons of wort. Depending on your actual results, you may have to liquor down your wort at the end of the boil to achieve the specified target original gravity.

Use a single-infusion process with a 90-minute rest at roughly 152 °F (66 °C). Then sparge with about 180 °F (82 °C) water for about 75 minutes. Make sure that the mash temperature at the end of the sparge has reached 168–170 °F (76–77 °C).

Boil your wort for 90 minutes. Add the bittering hops about 30 minutes into the boil. Add the flavor hops and Irish moss about 15 minutes before shutdown. Add the aroma hops (for the dubbel only) directly at shutdown.

Heat-exchange the wort to 68 °F (20 °C) and aerate. Because Trappist brews have a relatively high starting gravity, it is a good idea for a healthy cell count to pitch two packages of either the Wyeast 1388 or the WLP500. Alternatively you can use just one package of yeast and save money by making a yeast starter. Rack the brew off its debris after about two weeks. Then keep it undisturbed for another two to three weeks. Rack the beer again and prime it with sugar. At this point, to aid in bottle conditioning, add the remaining package of yeast. This yeast ought to be fairly alcohol-tolerant (such as Wyeast 1762 or WLP530). Package immediately after priming and inoculating.

The Wyeast 1388 performs best at a temperature of 65–75 °F (18–24 °C), the WLP500 at 65–70 °F (18–21 °C), the Wyeast 1762 at 65–75 °F (18–24 °C), and the WLP530 at 66–72 °F (19–22 °C). So regardless of your choice of yeast, you are safe if you keep both your fermentation and your conditioning temperature constant at around 68 °F (20 °C). You can start tasting the beer after about a month, but it will get much better after a conditioning rest of about half a year.

American Pilsners were bigger and hoppier in the past, right? Well, not always. In 1917 — near the end of World War I — Congress passed the Food and Fuel Control Act (also known as the Lever Act), which gave President Wilson the power to set prices on and direct the distribution of food and coal. Wilson shut distilleries, limited the amount of coal breweries could use and capped the alcohol percentage in beer to 2.75% by weight (about 3.4% by volume). Here is a classic American Pilsner an American infantryman (or doughboy) might have drank during training, before being shipped off to the trenches in Europe.

With such a high percentage of flaked grains, some rice hulls maybe a good addition to the mash in order to help loosen things up.

Ingredients
6 lbs. (2.7 kg) 2-row malt
2 lbs. (0.9 kg) flaked corn
1 lb. (0.45 kg) flaked rice
4 oz. (113 g) crystal malt (40 °L)
3.5 AAU Hallertau Magnum hops (60 min.) (0.25 oz. 7 g at 14% alpha acids)
1.9 AAU Saaz hops (10 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 3.75% alpha acids)
1 capsule Servomyces (10 min.)
5.5 g calcium chloride
White Labs WLP080 (Cream Ale Yeast Blend) yeast
3⁄4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
This is a single-step infusion mash. Mill the grains, then mix with the calcium chloride and 13.8 qts. (13.1 L) of 164 °F (73 °C) strike water to reach a mash temperature of 150 °F (66 °C). Hold this temperature for 60 minutes. Raise the mash temperature through infusion of boiling water or recirculating system up to mash out at 168 °F (76 °C). Hold this temperature for 5 minutes, then begin vorlauf. Sparge the grains with enough water to obtain 6.5 gallons (24.6 L) of wort. Boil for 60 minutes, adding hops according to the ingredient list. After the boil, whirlpool for 5 minutes, then let settle for 5 minutes. Chill the wort to about 65 °F (18 °C) and then pitch your yeast.

Once fermentation commences, allow beer to free rise up to 68 °F (20 °C). You can hold this temperature for ten days or until the completion of primary fermentation, whichever is later. Bottle or keg the beer and carbonate to approximately 2.5 volumes.

Extract with grains option:
Replace the 2-row malt, flaked corn, and flaked rice with 3 lbs. (2.7 kg) extra light dried malt extract, 1 lb. (0.45 kg) corn sugar, and 1 lb. (0.45 kg) rice syrup solids. Use 6.5 gallons (24.5 L) of water in the brew kettle; heat to 158 °F (70 °C). Steep the crystal grains for 20 minutes. Remove and rinse. Turn off the heat. Add the malt extract, corn sugar and rice solids, then make sure to stir thoroughly to dissolve completely. Turn the heat back on and bring to a boil.

The remainder of this recipe is the same as the all-grain version.

3⁄4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
This is a single infusion mash. Heat 18.2 qts. (17.2 L) of water, add 1 tsp. of calcium chloride. Mash grains for 60 minutes at 153 °F (67 °C). Sparge with enough water to collect 6.5 gallons (25 L) of wort in the kettle. Bring wort to a boil and boil for 60 minutes, add hops according to the recipe above. Add a kettle coagulant of your choice if you so desire.

After the boil is complete, give the wort a long stir to create a whirlpool and let settle for 10 minutes, then begin to chill. Bring down to yeast-pitching temperature, aerate the wort, and pitch the yeast. Ferment between 48–56 °F (9–14 °C). Ferment for 2 weeks at this temperature then raise temperature to low 70s °F (21–22 °C) and hold for 2 days. Transfer to a secondary and lager for 1–4 weeks at 33–35 °F (0–2 °C). Bottle or force carbonate per normal.

Extract brewers: Swap out the Munich and Pilsner malt with 4 lbs. (1.8 kg) of Munich dried malt extract and 2 lbs. (0.91 kg) of Pilsen dried malt extract. Heat water up towards a boil. Off heat, stir in the extract just prior to hitting a boil and stir until fully dissolved. Follow the remaining instructions from the all-grain recipe.

After the boil, add the whirlpool hops indicated and whirlpool for 15 minutes before rapidly chilling the wort to 66 °F (19 °C). Pitch yeast and aerate the wort. Maintain fermentation temperature of 68 °F (20 °C) for this beer.

Once primary fermentation is complete, and the beer has settled, bottle or keg the beer and carbonate to approximately 2.5 volumes.

Tips for Success:
First off, use high-quality, fresh ingredients with an emphasis on UK-based malts and hops if possible. Consider Crisp, Thomas Fawcett, and/or Simpsons as your maltsters of choice.

Next, focus on your fermentation. Ensure your pitch is appropriately sized and healthy; the easiest way is to either repitch yeast from a previous batch of beer or create a starter in whatever way you’re most comfortable. This yeast strain has been known to struggle to attenuate to this extent, so be sure to provide an ideal environment with proper temperature control to ensure a strong fermentation.

Finally, focus on water chemistry for a malt-forward beer. To this end, ensure you have at least 40 ppm of calcium in the brewing water but more importantly your ratio of chloride-to-sulfate should be in the range of 1:1 to 2:1. With great base ingredients that are well-attenuated and flavored appropriately with the right amount of ions, you should have no trouble brewing an amazing Scottish 90/-.

IBU = 8 SRM = 6 ABV = 4.9%

Winner of the 2014 Great American Beer Festival bronze medal in the American-Style Fruit Beer category. Original gravity is calculated prior to fruit addition while ABV is calculated post fruit addition.

Ingredients
8.5 lbs. (3.9 kg) Pilsner malt
0.38 lb. (0.17 kg) crystal malt (60 °L)
3.1 lbs. (1.4 kg) Oregon Specialty Fruit apricot purée
1-4 oz. (28-113 g) apricot extract
2.3 AAU Cascade hops (60 min.) (0.33 oz./10 g at 7.1% alpha acids)
Fermentis Safale S-04 or Wyeast 1099 (Whitbread Ale) yeast
5/8 cup (125 g) dextrose (if priming)

Step by Step
Mill the grains and mash in 3 gallons (11.3 L) of water at 150 °F (65 °C) for 60 minutes. Vorlauf until the runnings are clear and sparge the grains with enough 168 °F (75 °C) water to obtain a 6-gallon (23-L) pre-boil volume. Boil the wort for 60 minutes, adding hops at the times indicated. After the boil, turn off the heat and chill the wort to 68 °F (20 °C), transfer the wort to the fermenter, aerate well, and pitch the yeast. Ferment at 68 °F (20 °C). On day three of primary fermentation add the apricot purée. Ferment for an additional seven days and rack to a secondary fermenter for additional clearing if desired. When fermentation and clearing is complete, transfer the beer to a bottling bucket or keg and add apricot extract 0.5 oz. (14 mL) at a time, gently stirring and tasting in between additions until the desired intensity of fruit flavor and aroma is obtained. Carbonate and package the beer as desired.

Extract with grains option:
Substitute the Pilsner malt in the all-grain recipe with 6 lbs. (2.7 kg) Pilsen liquid malt extract. Add 1.5 to 5 gallons (6 to 19 L) of water to the brew kettle (the more water the better). Crush the grain and steep at 150 °F (65 °C) for 30 minutes. Add malt extract while stirring, then boil the wort for 60 minutes. Follow the remaining portion of the all-grain recipe.

Tips for success:
Fruit extracts are an easy and often effective way to add fruit flavor and aroma to a beer, though care should be taken to not overpower the beer by using too much. The intensity of flavor and aroma will vary from one brand of extract to the next, so some experimentation is necessary in order to obtain the correct balance. Try experimenting with a small amount of your beer and then scaling up when you find the right concentration.

Dry-Hopped Hard Cider Recipe
by Bryan Holmes • Citizen Cider, Essex, Vermont
(5 gallons/19 L)
OG = 1.060 FG = 0.998 ABV = ~8%

Ingredients
5.5 gallons (21 L) sweet apple cider
1.5–2 lbs. (0.7–0.9 kg) sugar
1 package dry Champagne yeast
Fermentation nutrients (e.g. Fermaid K, DAP)
Yeast rehydration nutrient (e.g. Fermaid Protect)
Potassium metabisulfate (KMS) or Campden tablets
Pectinase
Cascade Hops (whole or pellets)
Potassium sorbate (optional)

Step by Step
Sanitize your equipment using a product such as Star San. Do not use halogen-based sanitizers such as Iodophor. As soon as the cider is pressed and in the sanitized carboy, stir in 0.6 grams (0.12 grams per gallon) of potassium metabisulfite (KMS) for a target of 30 ppm free sulfites. Alternatively, you can use crushed Campden tablets to achieve 30 ppm free sulfites in 5 gallons (19 L).

To remove pectin and clarify the juice, add pectinase enzyme. Leave overnight and rack the juice into a sanitized carboy, leaving the sediment at the bottom of the first carboy.

Using your thermometer, rehydrate the dry yeast in 104 °F (40 °C) water with the yeast rehydration nutrient, following your yeast rehydration nutrient manufacturer's instructions. You do not want to add the yeast to your cool cider if the difference in temperatures of the yeast and the cider exceed 15 °F (8 °C). To avoid temperature shock, you should acclimate your yeast by taking about 10 mL of the cider and adding it to the yeast suspension. Wait 15 minutes and measure the temperature again. Do this until you are within the specified temperature range. Do not let the yeast sit in the original water suspension for longer than 20 minutes. Now pitch the yeast/nutrient/cider combination into the main volume of cider.

At the beginning of the fermentation, add a nitrogen source, such as Diammonium Phosphate (DAP) or Fermaid K. Follow the directions on the package. Often cidermakers will add half of the total needed nitrogen at the beginning of the fermentation and the second half after 1⁄3 of the sugars have been depleted. Use your hydrometer before the yeast is added to determine the initial sugar concentration and make measurements daily to know when to make the second nitrogen addition. A 10% sugar. Give the carboy a stir daily to rouse the sediment off of the bottom. Once the airlock has stopped bubbling and your hydrometer readings have stabilized just below 0.000 units, the fermentation has finished. Using a siphon, rack the dry cider into a clean, sanitized carboy. Add KMS or Campden tablets to bring the free sulfites up to 0.5–0.8 ppm molecular SO2. 0.8 ppm will give you about 99% protection against spoilage where 0.5 ppm is the minimum for protection. The trade off is that sulfur aromas (matchstick) may be detectable at the higher molecular SO2 levels. The amount of KMS or Campden tablets you need to add is based on the pH of the dry cider, so you have to measure the pH using a pH meter or with test strips. Alternatively, you could ask a local cidermaker, winemaker or brewer to make the measurement for you. Use an online sulfite calculator to calculate how many grams of KMS or Campden tablets you will need to reach your target SO2 level (http://www.winemakermag.com/guide/sulfite). Initially, multiple additions may need to be made to get the target level. Do not make more than one KMS or Campden addition per day.

Allow the cider to age, settle and clarify. After it clarifies, rack the dry cider into a clean, sanitized carboy. Aging time can be two or more months. Maintain free/molecular SO2 levels by using SO2 test kits (e.g. Accuvin) every few weeks and adding KMS or Campden tablets as necessary.

Dry Hopping
After the cider has sufficiently aged, add around 1.4 oz. (40 grams) of Cascade hop cones or pellets to the carboy. Sparge the carboy with an inert gas to displace the oxygen in the fermenter. Carbon dioxide is a good choice if you already have it in your homebrewery for kegging.

After four to seven days, rack the cider off of the settled hops and bottle or keg. Continually taste the cider until you've reached the desired aroma/flavors/ Since hop compounds are especially sensitive to oxidation, keeping oxygen at a minimum by sparging for a few minutes with CO2 will increase the shelf life and preserve aroma. To carbonate, shake the keg under about 30–40 PSI of head pressure for about 5 to 10 minutes while the keg is at refrigerator temperature.

For an off-dry or sweet cider, add about 50 to 400 grams (1.5 to 14 oz.) of sugar to the cider in a Corny keg. This should be done to taste. For off-dry, it is recommended here to start around 15 grams (~5 oz.) To prevent refermentation, add 3.5 grams (0.05 oz.) of potassium sorbate to the cider and refrigerate it at around 35 °F (2 °C) or below overnight. This cooling step must be done since the yeast must be dormant to prevent refermentation. To carbonate, shake the keg under about 30–40 PSI of head pressure for about five to ten minutes while the keg is at refrigerator temperature (between 35–38 °F/1.7–3.3 °C).

2.0 oz. (57 kg) chocolate malt (300–400 °L)
1/2 tsp. baking soda (added to mash)
1 tsp. Irish moss
9.25 AAU Perle hops (bittering) (1.2 oz./33 g of 8% alpha acid)
Wyeast 1084 or White Labs WLP004
3/4 cup corn sugar (for bottling)

Step by Step:

Bring 9 quarts (9 L) of water to 166 °F (74 °C) and mix in the malts and baking soda. The temperature should fall between 154–156 °F (68–69 °C). Hold mash for 60 minutes before sparging. Recirculate the wort until clear and then run off wort to the kettle. Once the top of the grain bed is covered by an inch of wort, begin sparging with 176 °F (80 °C) water. Collect 6 gallons (23 L) of wort. Bring wort to a boil, add hops and boil for 60 minutes. Add Irish moss 5 minutes before the end of boil. Cool wort to 70 °F (21 °C), aerate, pitch yeast andferment at 70 °F (21 °C). Rack after 10 days and a second time inanother 14 days. Then prime, bottle and hold 7 days before drinking.

This is the classic stout to serve on mixed gas using a stout faucet.

Extract with grains option:

An extract version of this beer can be made by substituting the pale malt for 6.0 lbs. (2.7 kg) of light
liquid malt extract or 4.25 lbs. (1.9 kg) of light dry malt extract.

A recipe for a spiced dubbel.

Ingredients
4 lbs. (1.8 kg) Belgian pale ale malt
0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) Belgian Special B malt
1 oz. (28 g) roasted barley
6 lbs. (2.7 kg) amber liquid malt extract extract
1 lb. (0.45 kg) amber Belgian candi sugar (or 2 cups brown sugar)
8 AAU Brewer’s Gold hop (60 min.) (1 oz./28 g at 8% alpha acids)
1 g black pepper, ground (0 min.)
1 cinnamon stick (0 min.)
1 g grains of paradise (0 min.)
Wyeast 3787 (Trappist Style High Gravity) or White Labs WLP530 (Abbey Ale) or Lallemand Abbaye or Safale BE-256 yeast
2/3 cup corn sugar for priming

Step by Step
Heat 2 gal. (7.6 L) water to 165 °F (74 °C). Crush grains and mix in, mash temperature should settle around 153 °F (67 °C). Hold 60 min., then removed grains and wash with 3 gal. (11 L) at 169 °F (77 °C).

Add malt extract and candi sugar to the kettle and bring to a boil. Add hops, then boil 60 min. Turn off heat and add pepper, cinnamon, and grains of paradise. Give the wort a long stir to create a whirlpool and let settle for 15 minutes. Cool and transfer to your primary fermenter. Add enough water to make up 5.25 gal (20 L). Chill to 68 °F (20 °C), pitch yeast, and seal.

Ferment as close to 70 °F (21 °C) as you can manage. Rack to secondary if you prefer after about two weeks, cool to 55 °F (13 °C) for six weeks. Prime with corn sugar and bottle or keg and force carbonate.

Notes:

Grains: There’s just something about Belgian grains. Sure, go ahead and substitute British or American pale ale malt, but I wouldn’t! Special B is a highly caramelized crystal-type malt. Dark crystal isn’t quite the same. Be very careful of the roasted barley — it is not entirely typical or appropriate in a Belgian recipe, but I like what it adds here.

Sugars: Candi sugar is beet sugar, so its flavor profile is different from cane sugar. Brown sugar will work, but you are adding molasses with brown sugar. It would work if Belgian candi sugar is hard to acquire.

Spices: This is just one of many combinations possible. The idea is to strike a balance, find a contrast that stands out. It should be fairly sharp, pronounced, but not overwhelming. If you’ve never tried using grains of paradise, which is a relative of cardamom, you are in for a pleasant surprise! The pepper and grains of paradise are small enough to settle out with the rest of the trub, but you will probably want to fish out the cinnamon stick, or you can try to put the whole mix in a fine-mesh muslin bag.

Dublin Stout
(5 gallons/19 L, extract with grains)
OG = 1.085 FG = 1.026
IBU = 83 SRM = 45 ABV = 7.6%

Ingredients
12 lbs. (5.4 kg) pale malt syrup (10 °L)
0.75 lb. (0.34 kg) black malt (550 °L)
23 AAU Target hops (90 mins.) (2.3 oz./65 g at 10% alpha acids)
White Labs WLP004 (Irish Ale) or Wyeast 1084 (Irish Ale) yeast (2 packs as 1.5 quart/1.4 L starter)

Step by Step
Steep the crushed black malt in 2 quarts (1.9 L) water at 150-160 °F (66-71 °C) for 20 minutes. Wash the grain bag with 2 quarts (1.9 L) hot water and top off kettle. This is a 90-minute boil so if you are doing a full wort boil, be sure to top off to at least 6.5 gallons (25 L) wort in your kettle to accommodate extra evaporation. Before reaching a boil, remove your kettle from heat and stir in the malt syrup. Be sure to stir until fully dissolved and return to heat. Add hops as the wort reaches a boil. After 90 minutes, cool wort to 68 °F (20 °C) and pitch yeast. Ferment at 68 °F (20 °C) and allow to condition for at least one month prior to bottling or kegging.

Dunkelweizen
Dunkelweizen
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.050 (12.4 °P) FG = 1.012 (3.1 °P)
IBU = 15 SRM = 18 ABV = 5%

Ingredients
6.6 lb. (3 kg) Great Western wheat malt (2 °L) or similar
3.3 lb. (1.5 kg) Durst Munich malt (8°L) or similar
8.8 oz. (250 g) Briess Caramel Munich (60 °L) or similar
2.6 oz. (75 g) Weyermann Carafa® Special II (430 °L)
2.96 AAU Hallertau pellet hops (60 min.) (0.74 oz./21 g at 4% alpha acids)
Wyeast 3068 (Weihenstephan Weizen) or White Labs WLP300 (Hefeweizen Ale) or Lallemand Munich Classic yeast

Step by Step
Mill the grains and dough-in targeting a mash of around 1.5 quarts of water to 1 pound of grain (a liquor-to-grist ratio of about 3:1 by weight) and a temperature of 154 °F (68 °C). Hold the mash at 154 °F (68 °C) until enzymatic conversion is complete. Infuse the mash with near boiling water while stirring or with a recirculating mash system raise the temperature to mash out at 168 °F (76 °C). Sparge slowly with 170 °F (77 °C) water, collecting wort until the pre-boil kettle volume is around 6.5 gallons (24.4 L) and the gravity is 1.039 (9.7 °P).

The total wort boil time is 90 minutes, which helps reduce the S-methyl methionine (SMM) present in the lightly kilned pilsner malt and results in less dimethyl sulfide (DMS) in the finished beer. Add the bittering hops with 60 minutes remaining in the boil. I skip using kettle finings in this beer. Chill the wort rapidly to 62 °F (17 °C), let the break material settle, rack to the fermenter, pitch the yeast and aerate thoroughly. The proper pitch rate is 9 grams of properly rehydrated dry yeast, two packages of liquid yeast or one package of liquid yeast in a 1.5-liter starter.

Ferment at 62 °F (17 °C) until the beer attenuates fully. With healthy yeast, fermentation should be complete in a week, but don't rush it. The cooler than average ale fermentation temperature can extend the time it takes for complete attenuation. Rack to a keg and force carbonate or rack to a bottling bucket, add priming sugar, and bottle. Target a carbonation level of 2.5 to 3 volumes.

OG = 1.051 (12.7 °P) FG = 1.013 (3.2 °P)
IBU = 15 SRM = 15 ABV = 5.1%

Ingredients
4.4 lb. (2 kg) wheat liquid malt extract (4 °L)
2.2 lb. (1 kg) Weyermann Munich Amber liquid malt extract (8 °L)
8.8 oz. (250 g) Briess Caramel Munich malt (60 °L) or similar
2.6 oz. (75 g) Weyermann Carafa® Special II (430 °L)
3.12 AAU Hallertau pellet hops (60 min.) (0.78 oz./22 at 4% alpha acids)
Wyeast 3068 (Weihenstephan Weizen) or White Labs WLP300 (Hefeweizen Ale) or Lallemand Munich Classic yeast

Step by Step
I have used a number of wheat and Munich malt extracts with good results. Always choose the freshest extract that fits the beer style. If you can't get fresh liquid malt extract, it is better to use an appropriate amount of dried malt extract (DME) instead.

Mill or coarsely crack the specialty malt and place loosely in a grain bag. Avoid packing the grains too tightly in the bag, using more bags if needed. Steep the bag in about 0.5 gallon (~2 liters) of water at roughly 170 °F (77 °C) for about 30 minutes. Lift the grain bag out of the steeping liquid and rinse with warm water. Allow the bags to drip into the kettle for a few minutes while you add the malt extract. Do not squeeze the bags. Add enough water to the steeping liquor and malt extract to make a pre-boil volume of 5.9 gallons (22.3 L) and a gravity of 1.043 (10.8 °P). Stir thoroughly to help dissolve the extract and bring to a boil.

The total wort boil time is 60 minutes. Add the bittering hops with 60 minutes remaining in the boil. I skip kettle finings for this beer. Chill the wort rapidly to 62 °F (17 °C), let the break material settle, rack to the fermenter, pitch the yeast and aerate thoroughly. The proper pitch rate is 9 grams of properly rehydrated dry yeast, two packages of liquid yeast or one package of liquid yeast in a 1.5-liter starter. Follow the remainder of the all-grain version of this recipe.

(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.054 FG = 1.013
IBU = 18 SRM = 16–17 ABV = 5.2%

Ingredients
7.2 lbs. (3.3 kg) pale wheat malt
2.7 lbs. (1.2 kg) Pils malt
0.5 lbs. (0.23 kg) Vienna malt
0.5 lbs. (0.23 kg) Munich malt
0.3 lbs. (0.14 kg) caramel wheat malt
0.1 lbs. (0.05 kg) dehusked chocolate malt
0.25 oz.(7 g) SINIMAR color extract
5 AAU Hallertauer Mittelfrüh hops (bittering) (1.25 oz./36 g of 4% alpha acid)
1 oz. (28 g) Hallertauer Mittelfrüh
1 tsp. Irish moss
Wyeast 3068 (Weihenstephan Weizen) or White Labs WLP380 (Hefeweizen IV) yeast
1 quart (1 L) sterile wort (for priming)

Step by step
In your kettle, dough in to around 96 °F (36 °C) with 2.7 gallons (10 L) of water. Raise the temperature, over two hours, to 170 °F (77 °C) by both infusing the mash with near-boiling water and applying direct heat.

Once at mash-out temperature, transfer the mash to your lauter tun. Recirculate until the run-off is clear, then start lautering. Sparge with hot water until you reach a kettle gravity of about 1.046 for a 2-hour boil, keeping the sparge water hot enough to maintain grain bed temperature. Add bittering hops half way through the boil. Add flavor hops half an hour before shut-down. Siphon off 1 quart (~1 L) of wort for priming at bottling time. Add 1 tsp. Irish moss and 0.25 oz. (7 g) of SINAMAR color malt extract to the kettle. Whirlpool the wort for about an hour. Siphon the clarified wort off the debris into a sanitized bucket and chill wort to 68 °F (20 °C). Pitch the yeast into a clean carboy, siphon the cooled wort over the yeast and aerate the beer.

Lower the temperature of the fermenter over 2–3 days to about 45 °F (7 °C). One week after pitching, rack the brew into a clean carboy and let the temperature rise to room temperature. Keep it there for another two or three days. Finally, pour the sterile wort (here called speise) into a carboy and rack the brew into it. To bottle-condition the dunkelweizen, package it immediately. To keg-condition it, simply seal the Cornelius keg. Keep the beer at room temperature for a week, then cold-condition for two weeks around 45 °F (7 °C). And no, do not serve this beer with a lemon slice!

Partial mash option: Replace the wheat malt and Pilsner malt in the all-grain formulation with 6.5 lbs. (2.9 kg) Weyermann Bavarian Hefeweizen liquid malt extract. The rest of the ingredients remain the same.

Step by step
Place the milled grains into a muslin bag. Immerse the bag in roughly 0.5 gallons (2 L) of cold water and slowly heat to 170–190 °F (77–88 °C). This step should take about 30 minutes. Remove grain bag from brewing water and rinse grains with roughly 0.5 gallons (2 L) of water at 165 °F (74 °C). Heat the resulting "grain tea" to boiling, then stir in the malt extracts. Bring the wort to a boil and add the bittering hops immediately. Boil for 60 minutes. Half an hour into the boil, add the flavor hops. After another half hour, turn off the heat to the kettle and follow all subsequent instructions for the all-grain version.

IBU = 40 SRM = 15 ABV = 4.7%

The grain bill of the classic copper-colored altbier — which is internationally also known as a German Brown Ale — is almost Munich-like, but with a slightly less "caramelly" character than a Märzen, and less dark than a dunkel. It differs from a Munich brew, however, in its much more pronounced hoppiness. This creates a wonderful blend of malt-and-hop aromas in the finish, which is often described as bitter-sweet. The uniqueness of this beer — an ale after all — comes from the clean fermentation of a relatively cold-tolerant, top-fermenting specialty yeast.

Ingredients

5.5 lbs. (2.5 kg) German Munich I malt
2.33 lbs. (1.05 kg) continental Pilsner malt
2 lbs. (900 g) Weyermann Carared® malt (17 °L)
3.2 oz. (90 g) Weyermann Carafa® Special I malt (338 °L)
7.6 AAU Spalt hops (60 min.) (1.9 oz./53 g at 4% alpha acids)
4.4 AAU Spalt hops (10 min.) (1.1 oz./32 g at 4% alpha acids)
Wyeast 1007 (German Ale) or White Labs WLP036 (Düsseldorf Alt) or Safale K-97 yeast
3⁄4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step

This is a multi-step mash. Crush grains and mash in at 122 °F (50 °C). Rest 15 min. Raise the temperature to 147 °F (64 °C) and rest 15 minutes. Raise the temperature to 162 °F (72 °C) and rest 15 minutes. Raise the temperature for the mash-out to 171 °F (77 °C). Recirculate, then begin sparge.

Boil for 75 minutes, adding hops as indicated. Turn off heat and whirlpool 15 minutes. Heat-exchange to the mid-range of the temperature tolerance of the selected yeast strain. This range is often between 54 °F and 68 °F (12 °C and 20 °C). Ferment for about 7 days. At a gravity of roughly 1.014 to 1.017, raise the tank temperature for a 2-day diacetyl rest to approximately 66 °F (19 °C).

For a secondary fermentation, lower the temperature again to the yeast’s mid-range. After 5 additional days, purge the sedimented yeast and debris. Transfer the brew to a capped conditioning tank. Lager for 3 weeks at about 36 °F to 25 °F (2 °C to -4 °C). Adjust the carbonation to approximately 2.2 to 2.6 volumes of CO2. Package filtered or unfiltered.

Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat's Duvel clone
Duvel clone
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.061 FG = 1.007
IBU = 30 SRM = 3 ABV = 8.5%

Duvel is the classic Belgian golden ale. Although it is very strong (8.5% ABV), the beer is extremely light in color and dry in taste. The dense, white head that sits above the beer lasts until the beer is done. In the US, bottles of Duvel often show some oxidation in the aroma. Brewing it fresh at home gives you a glimpse of what it tastes like in Belgium. The yeast will not have an easy job here; they are dealing with a high-gravity, high-adjunct wort. Help them (and yourself) out by making a big yeast starter for a high cell count at pitching.

Ingredients
11.5 lbs. (5.2 kg) Belgian Pilsner malt
8 oz. (0.23 kg) corn sugar (kettle)
1 lb. (0.45 g) corn sugar (dosage)
6 AAU Styrian Goldings hops (60 min.) (1.2 oz./34 g of 5% alpha acids)
3.75 AAU Saaz hops (15 min.) (0.93 oz./27 g of 4% alpha acids)
0.75 oz. (21 g) Saaz hops (0 min.)
1/4 tsp yeast nutrients (kettle)
1/16 tsp ("a pinch") yeast nutrients (dosage)
1 tsp Irish moss (15 min.)
Wyeast 1388 (Belgian Strong Ale) or White Labs WLP570 (Belgian Golden Ale) yeast (3 qt./3 L yeast starter)
1 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
In your brew kettle, mash in to 131°F (55°C) and heat the mash slowly, over 15 minutes, to 140°F (60°C). Add boiling water to raise the temperature to 148°F (64°C) and hold for 60 minutes. Mash out, vorlauf, and then sparge at 168°F (76°C). (Option: To increase wort fermentablility, mash in at 99°F (37°C) and slowly ramp up the temperature to mash-out temperature. The ramp time can take anywhere from 90 minutes to as long as 3 hours.) Collect enough wort in the brew kettle to compensate for a longer boil. Boil for 90 minutes, adding the hops as indicated in the ingredients list. With 15 minutes left in boil, add the kettle sugar, yeast nutrients, and Irish moss. At the end of the boil, add the last charge of hops, rapidly cool the wort, and transfer it to a sanitized fermenter. The specific gravity reading should be roughly 1.061. The brewers of Duvel pitch at 60°F (16°C) and let the temperature rise to as high as 84°F (29°C) during primary fermentation. If you are not capable of ramping the fermentation temperature, pitch the yeast and then ferment at 68°F (20°C). When primary fermentation is slowing down (3 to 4 days), add the dosage sugar with a pinch of yeast nutrients that have been dissolved in hot water held at 160°F (71°C) for 15 minutes. After final gravity is achieved, rack to a secondary fermenter and allow the beer to condition for 2 to 3 weeks. Bottle or keg when the beer falls clear.

East End Brewing (Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania) brews this American-style barleywine as an anniversary beer each November, and then bottle conditions and hand packages them.

Ingredients
15 lbs. (6.8 kg) Canadian pale malt
2.25 lbs. (1 kg) light Munich malt (6 °L)
2.25 lbs. (1 kg) Franco-Belges aromatic malt (4 °L)
2.25 lbs. (1 kg) Franco-Belges caramel Pilsen malt(10 °L)
17.1 AAU CTZ hops (120 min.) (1.2 oz./34 g at 14.25% alpha acids)
4.25 AAU Centennial hops (15 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 8.5% alpha acids)
4.8 AAU Chinook hops (15 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 9.6% alpha acids)
0.25 oz. (7 g) Cascade hops (0 min.)
0.25 oz. (7 g) Chinook (0 min.)
1⁄2 tsp. Irish moss (15 min.)
1⁄2 tsp. yeast nutrients (10 min.)
Fermentis S-04 or Wyeast 1098 (London Ale) or White Labs WLP013 (London Ale) yeast
2⁄3 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by step

Build up double or triple the amount of yeast you’d use for a normal ale in a yeast starter. Pitching an actively fermenting starter would be best so take the time to do this in advance of your brew day.

Mash in at 146–148 °F (63–64 °C), using 1.25 qts./lb. of grain (2.6 L/kg), about 27.2 qts. (25.7 L). After 60 minutes, recirculate your wort for about ten minutes, then sparge at 175 °F (79 °C) with an estimated 17 qts. (Collect approximately 8 gallons/30 L wort. A sample of wort should read 1.070 SG at room temperature. Supplement with sugar if this reading is low. East End boils for 3 hours so depending upon your evaporation rate, you may want to adjust your boil time depending upon your system. The long boil time gives caramelization character via melanoidins and if you don’t have a kettle large enough, you could boil in two kettles. Check your gravity as you boil so you can adjust to land at target of 5.25 gallons (20 L) or wort around 1.110 SG at the end of the boil. Add hops, Irish moss, and yeast nutrient as indicated. Check that pH is in the ballpark of 5.2 at the end of the boil.

After boil, chill to around 66–68 °F (19–20 °C) as rapidly as possible and ferment. If you have the ability to control fermentation temperature, raise set point 1–2 °F/1 °C daily. After 3–4 days, let the temperature free rise. Oxygenate 2–3 times more than you would for a normal gravity ale, and pitch the active yeast starter. You should see fermentation activity within 16 hours or so. If you don’t, check pH to see if it is below where it was when you checked OG. If it is not, consider re-pitching.When primary fermentation appears to be complete, rack the beer to a secondary fermenter. Rack again after 2–3 weeks into bottle or keg using the low end of normal priming or carbonating prescriptions (You want 2.3 volumes of CO2).

Tips for Success:

Low mash temperatures, as indicated in the Step by Step will help your attenuation, so do your best to mash on the low end. Remember, great yeast health is imperative so make that your primary focus as you plan your brew!

Easy Tesgüino
Easy Tesgüino
(5 gallons/19 L)
OG = up to 1.046 FG = ~1.006
ABV = around 3.3%

This recipe is easy to reproduce in a modern homebrewery. In the recipe for easy tesgüino, the fermentable sugars are derived from sugar rather than corn.

Ingredients
4.4 lbs. (2 kg) dry, large-kernel corn
11 cones piloncillo sugar (or ~44 oz./1.3 kg cane sugar)
Ale yeast (your choice)

Step by Step
Grind the corn and boil with 2–3 gallons (7.6–11 L) of water and 11 cones of piloncillo cane sugar, stirring so that the sugar dissolves. As an option, you can add a few pieces of whole cinnamon. Cook the ingredients over low heat for one hour; remove from heat, add 2–4 more sticks of cinnamon (optional), and let sit in pot for 20 minutes. Cool and transfer to fermenter, leaving behind as much of the corn solids as feasible. Top up to 5 gallons (19 L) and ferment with ale yeast for about 4 days. Throw a party and drink the entire batch immediately.

More traditional option:
Some Latino specialty markets sell jora (malted corn) and you can substitute about 7.0 lbs. (3.2 kg) of this for the (unmalted) corn and sugar above. Heat mixture of 5 gallons (19 L) water and jora slowly to a boil. (Traditional tesgüino pots are heated over open flames.) Spend at least 1 hour ramping through the 140–162 °F/60–72 °C range. Simmer for 3 hours. Cool with immersion chiller and ferment in brewpot. (Traditional tesgüino pots cool in the cold mountain air.) Ferment with the yeast of your choice. (Traditional tesgüino is inoculated by stirring the mixture with grass leaves laden with suitable wild yeasts.) Serve lightly chilled (think cool mountain temperatures), unfiltered and uncarbonated with four friends. (Tradition-ally, most folks attending a tesgüinada consume around 4 quarts /~4 L of tesgüino.) In this version of tesgüino, your OG will be lower (around 1.034), but the "beer" will be stronger because it will contain less starch than the easy version above. The alcoholic strength will depend on how much extract you get from the jora and your yeast’s attenuation, but roughly 4.0% ABV is a fair estimate.

River Runners Pale Ale is a classic American pale ale with a bright, summery, fresh, fruity aroma and an easy-drinking quality.

Ingredients
9 lbs. (4.1 kg) 2-row pale malt
1 lb. (0.45 kg) crystal malt (10 °L)
1 lb. (0.45 kg) Carapils® malt
6.6 AAU Magnum hops (60 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 13.2% alpha acids)
3.5 AAU Cascade hops (10 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 7% alpha acids)
7.5 AAU El Dorado® hops (10 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 15% alpha acids)
4.5 AAU Amarillo® hops (0 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 9% alpha acids)
0.5 oz. (14 g) Amarillo® (dry hop)
0.5 oz. (14 g) El Dorado® (dry hop)
White Labs WLP017 (Whitbread Ale) or Wyeast 1099 (Whitbread Ale) yeast
3⁄4 cup (150 g) dextrose (if priming)

Step by Step
Mill the grains and mix with 3.5 gallons (13.25 L) of 165 °F (74 °C) strike water to reach a mash temperature of 153 °F (67 °C). Hold this temperature for 60 minutes. Vorlauf until your runnings are clear. Sparge the grains with 3.1 gallons (11.7 L) and top up as necessary to obtain 6 gallons (23 L) of wort. Boil for 75 minutes, adding hops according to the ingredient list. After the boil, turn off heat and whirlpool for 15 minutes. Then chill the wort to slightly below fermentation temperature, about 65 °F (18 °C). Aerate the wort with pure oxygen or filtered air and pitch yeast. Ferment at 69 °F (21 °C) for six days. Add the dry hops and hold at 69 °F (21 °C) for four more days. Once the beer reaches terminal gravity, bottle or keg the beer and carbonate to approximately 2.5 volumes. You may want to cold-crash the beer prior to packaging to 35 °F (2 °C) for 48 hours to improve the beer’s clarity.

Extract with grains option:
Substitute the 2-row pale malt in the all-grain recipe with 6 lbs. (2.7 kg) extra light liquid malt extract. Bring 5.6 gallons (21.2 L) of water to approximately 162 °F (72 °C) and hold there. Steep the milled specialty grains in grain bags for 15 minutes. Remove the grain bags, and let drain fully. Add liquid extract while stirring, and stir until completely dissolved. Bring the wort to a boil. Boil for 60 minutes, adding hops according to the ingredient list. Follow the remaining portion of the all-grain recipe.

Edgy Pils
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.047 FG = 1.010
IBU = 48 SRM = 3 ABV = 4.8%

Ingredients
9.5 lbs. (4.3 kg) Weyermann Pilsner Malt (2 °L)
10.4 AAU Tettnanger hops (75 min.) (2.3 oz./65 g of 4.5% alpha acid)
4.5 AAU Tettnanger hops (15 min.) (1 oz./28 g of 4.5% alpha acids)
1 oz. (28 g) Hallertauer Mittelfrüh hops (0 min.)
1 tsp Irish moss (15 mins)
Wyeast 2042 (Danish Lager) yeast (~3 qt./3 L starter)
1 cup dried malt extract (for priming)

Step by Step
Dough in at about 122 °F (50 °C) for a 30-minute rest. Then raise the mash temperature, using a combination of hot-water infusion and direct heat, to 148 °F ±2 °F (64 °C ±1°C) for a 30-minute beta saccharification rest. Then raise it to 156 °F ±2 °F (69 °C ±1 °C) for a 30-minute alpha saccharification rest. Then raise it to 170 °F ±2 °F (77 °C ±1 °C) for the mash-out. Recirculate the wort until it runs brilliantly clear (about 15 minutes). Then lauter and sparge.

Boil for 90 minutes. Add bittering hops 15 minutes into the boil. Add flavor hops and Irish moss 75 minutes into the boil. Add aroma hops at shut-down. Check the gravity and adjust for evaporation losses. Give the wort a long strir to create a whirlpool and let rest for about 30 minutes to allow the trub to settle.

Siphon the wort off the trub and heat exchange to a pitching temperature as close to 49 °F (9.4 °C) as possible. If you have trouble heat-exchanging to such a low temperature, pitch your yeast anyway, but refrigerate your fermenter immediately to pull the temperature down to the required level as quickly as possible.

Failure to reduce the fermentation temperature could result in excess diacetyl. Because the lag time between pitching and the start of primary fermentation may be a day or two, it is particularly important to aerate the wort thoroughly to avoid the formation of DMS. Let the brew ferment for about two weeks, at which point it should be at least 90% attenuated (at approximately SG 1.014 or 3.5 °P).

Rack and reduce the temperature gradually by about 2 °F (1 °C) per day. Drop the temperature to as low as your setup allows. The best lagering temperature is around the freezing point, but any temperature below 40 °F (4 °C) is serviceable.

Let the brew mature for about two weeks. Rack again and let it warm up to room temperature for a 3-day diacetyl rest. Then return the brew to the lagering temperature for two to six weeks of final maturation on the yeast, the longer the better. During lagering, the remaining yeast reabsorbs many of its own fermentation byproducts for a crisp taste. It also scrubs the brew clean of dissolved oxygen for greater stability. At the end of the lagering period, rack the brew once more and prime it for bottling or kegging. Store it at the serving temperature of 46–48 °F (8–9 °C). Allow about two weeks for the priming agent to be metabolized. If you use a Cornelius keg and a CO2 dispenser, omit the priming agent and set the pressure to about 15 PSI (1 atmosphere). It will take about 2 days for the Pils to be properly carbonated.

EKU 28 Type Dopplebock
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1..112 FG = 1.018
ABV = 11%

This recipe uses entirely pale malts, just as the EKU, but do not worry. This beer has plenty of malty character and a surprising amount of color. Its 28° Plato (1.112) makes it a big beer no matter how you look at it.

Ingredients
15 lbs. (6.8 kg) pale Munich malt (6 °L)
3 lbs. (1.4 kg) Pilsner malt
1 lb. (0.45 kg) carapils or dextrin type malt
6.4 AAU. German Northern Brewer hops (90 min.) (0.75 oz./21 g at 8.5% alpha acids)
2.8 AAU Hallertauer hops (30 min.) (0.75 oz./21 g at 3.7% alpha)
0.5 oz. (14 g) Hallertauer hops (0 min.)
Wyeast 2206 (Bavarian Lager), at least 4 pt. of starter

Step by Step
If your mash tun is big enough, mash grains in 6 gal. (23 L) water in a single infusion at 150 °F (66 °C) for 60 min. Sparge with 168° to 170 °F (76 to 77 °C) water to collect 7 gal. (26.5 L) of wort. Final runoff gravity will still be quite high. Utilizing a parti-gyle technique here maybe a good option to reduce boil time and allow for a small beer if you desire. If your mash tun is too small, simply mash twice and combine the runoff wort from both before boiling. Total boil is 120 min. Add Northern Brewer hops with 90 min left in the boil and remaining hops according to the ingredients list. At the end of boil, create a whirlpool and let settle. Chill to 45 °F (7 °C) and pitch yeast starter. Oxygenate/aerate really well.

Ferment at 45 °F (7 °C) for seven days, allowing the temperature to rise to 50 °F (10 °C) on the seventh day. Continue to ferment for 10 to 14 more days or until the beer has reached about 1.020 (5° Plato). If fermen­tation ceases, you may have to krausen with some actively fermenting slurry. At this point you can begin lager the beer for extended period or optionally you can begin the ice concentration to create an eisbock.

To create an eisbock, cool the beer to 28 °F (-2 °C) or until ice begins to form on the top. This could take several weeks. Obviously this is a strong beer, so 5 percent ice removal should be plenty. Then again, some homebrewers are completely crazed and would enjoy a beer of 15 to 20 percent alcohol by volume.

A beer this strong will really test the attenuative ability of your yeast. There will be a lot of residual sugar, but this is perfectly in style for the EKU. We recommend pitching a fresh packet of bottling yeast such as Lallemandn CBC-1 if you plan to bottle condition.

EKU 28 Type Dopplebock
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1..112 FG = 1.018

Ingredients
18 lbs. light malt syrup
1 lb. carapils or dextrin type malt
6.4 AAU. German Northern Brewer hops (60 min.) (0.75 oz./21 g at 8.5% alpha acids)
2.8 AAU Hallertauer hops (30 min.) (0.75 oz./21 g at 3.7% alpha)
0.5 oz. (14 g) Hallertauer hops (0 min.)
Wyeast 2206 (Bavarian Lager), at least 4 pt. of starter

Step by Step
Start with 5 gal. (19 L) of water. Crush and steep the grains ( in a nylon sack) as the water heats up to 180 °F (82 °C). Drain the sack well and rinse the grain with enough 168 °F (76 °C) water to make a total of 5.5 gal (21 L). Boil time is 60 min. Stir in syrup and stir until completely dissolved. Add hops according to the ingredient list. At the end of boil, create a whirlpool and let settle. Chill to 45 °F (7 °C) and pitch yeast starter. Oxygenate/aerate really well.

Follow the same fermentation and lagering schedule outlined in the all grain recipe.

Richly malty and long on the palate, with just enough hop backing. This amber altbier undergoes a cool, slow fermentation to help condition the flavors, contributing to its overall balance and smoothness.

Ingredients
9.5 lbs. (4.3 kg) pale ale malt
1 lb. (0.45 kg) crystal malt (40 °L)
0.66 lb. (0.3 kg) crystal malt (60 °L)
0.33 lb. (0.14 kg) crystal malt (90 °L)
3.3 AAU Cascade hops (60 min.) (0.66 oz./18 g at 5% alpha acids)
3.33 AAU Saaz hops (15 min.) (1.1 oz./31 g at 3% alpha acids)
1 tsp. Irish moss (15 min.)
Wyeast 1007 (German Ale) or White Labs WLP029 (German Ale/Kölsch) yeast (1.5 qt./~1.5 L yeast starter)
3/4 cup (150 g) dextrose (if priming)

Step by Step
Mash the grains in 14 qts. (13 L) of water at 152 °F (67 °C). Mash out, vorlauf, and then sparge at 170 °F (77 °C) to collect 6 gallons (23 L) of wort. Add 2 qts. (1.9 L) of water and boil 90 minutes, adding hops and Irish moss at times indicated. Cool, aerate, and pitch yeast. Ferment at 68 °F (20 °C). After fermentation is complete, bottle or keg as usual.

Extract with grains option:
Reduce the pale ale malt in the all-grain recipe to 1 lb. (0.45 kg) and add 2 lbs. 2 oz. (1 kg) light dried malt extract and 3.3 lbs. (1.5 kg) light liquid malt extract. Steep grains in 5.5 gallons (21 L) of water at 154 °F (68 °C) for 45 minutes. Rinse with 2 qts. (2 L) of water at 168 °F (76 °C). Remove grains and add malt extracts as you bring to a 60-minute boil. Follow the remaining portion of the all-grain recipe.

This beer should be bitter and have a nice "Spalty" nose to it. But to keep the hops from overwhelming the palate the malt has to come through as well. The roasty undertones of the Munich and Vienna malts complement the aggressiveness of the hops very well.

Ingredients
7.25 lbs. (3.3 kg) Pilsen malt
2 lbs. (0.91 kg) Vienna malt
1 lb. (0.45 kg) Munich malt (10 °L)
0.5 lb. (0.45 kg) wheat malt
0.5 lb. (0.45 kg) caramel malt (60 °L)
2 oz. (57 g) Carafa® III malt
6 AAU Northern Brewer hops (60 min.) (0.66 oz./19 g of 9% alpha acids)
3 AAU Northern Brewer hops (30 min.) (0.31 oz./9 g of 9% alpha acids)
2 AAU German Spalt hops (30 min.) (0.35 oz./10 g of 5% alpha acids)
3 oz. (85 g) German Spalt (0 min.)
Wyeast 1056 (American Ale), White Labs WLP001 (California Ale) or Safale US-05 yeast (1.5 qt./~1.5 L yeast starter)
0.75 cups corn sugar (for priming)

Step by Step
Mash at 153–154 °F (67–68 °C) for 30 minutes. Boil for 60 minutes. Ferment at 58–60 °F (14–16 °C) for 5 days. Allow temperature to rise naturally (but not above 68 °F/20 °C) until day 7 or 8. Then crash to below 40 °F (4 °C) over 4 days, rack off yeast and lager for 20–30 days to below 34–38 °F (1–3 °C) if possible.

This is a great example of how to build the grain bill without relying on chocolate or black malt. A blend of dark crystal malts gives this recipe that classic malty mild flavor. Andy Parker, Owner and Head Brewer of Elusive, is a homebrewer at heart; however, and couldn’t resist using Bramling Cross to make this recipe a bit different from other traditional English mild ales. Bramling is a relatively modern hop, released in the 1960s, and has a distinct blackcurrant aroma. Bramling adds atypical flavors for a mild, yet they complement the sweet malt flavors well.

Ingredients
6 lbs. (2.7 kg) Maris Otter pale ale malt
1.5 lbs. (0.68 kg) Munich malt (20 °L)
8.8 oz. (250 g) Crisp crystal 400 (150 °L)
3.5 oz. (100 g) Special B malt
3.5 oz. (100 g) Simpsons DRC malt
1.2 AAU Bramling Cross hops (60 min.) (0.2 oz./6 g at 6% alpha acids)
2.4 AAU Bramling Cross hops (30 min.) (0.4 oz./11 g at 6% alpha acids)
2.4 AAU Bramling Cross hops (15 min.) (0.4 oz./11 g at 6% alpha acids)
1 oz. (28 g) Bramling Cross hops (0 min)
White Labs WLP002 (English Ale), Wyeast 1968 (London ESB Ale), or LalBrew London yeast
1⁄3 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by step
Mash crushed grains at 151 °F (66 °C) for 60 minutes. Batch sparge slowly for 15 minutes at 162 °F (72 °C). Collect 6.5 gallons (24.5 L) of wort in the brew kettle. Bring wort to boil for a standard 60-minute boil, adding hops as indicated in the ingredients list.

When the boil is complete, cool wort down to 65 °F (18 °C) and transfer to fermentation vessel.

Add yeast as packet directs. Bottle conditioning mild is much more traditional than force carbonating in a keg, but either way mild is best served at lower carbonation levels. Aim for 1.5–2.0 volumes of carbonation.

Step by step
Steep crushed grains in a muslin bag as brewing water heats up to 170 °F (77 °C). Turn off the heat, remove the grains allowing liquid to drip back in the kettle, and stir in all the liquid malt extract. Once extract is fully dissolved, bring wort up to a boil for a standard 60-minute boil, adding hops as indicated in the ingredients list.

When the boil is complete, cool wort to 65 °F (18 °C) and transfer to fermenter. Add yeast as packet
directs. Bottle conditioning mild is much more traditional than force carbonating in a keg, but either way mild is best served at lower carbonation levels. Aim for 1.5–2.0 volumes of carbonation.

Tips for success:
Bramling Cross hops can be difficult to source outside of the U.K. If you can’t get ahold of Bramling Cross then Bullion or Galena would be appropriate substitutes for a similar blackcurrant character. You could also go with a traditional mild ale variety such as Fuggle or East Kent Golding, but this will result in a beer further from Elusive’s Microball.

Step by Step
Two or three days before brewing, make a yeast starter. (OG 1.015 to 1.020, aerated thoroughly before pitching the yeast. Ferment yeast starter in the mid 70s °F/~24 °C.) On brew day, mash in at 152 °F (67 °C) in 20 qts. (19 L) of water and hold for 60 minutes. Recirculate until wort clears, then begin collecting your wort. Sparge with water hot enough to make the grain bed temperature rise to 170 °F (77 °C) by the end of wort collection. (Or, mash out to 170 °F/ 77 °C and sparge with water hot enough to keep the grain bed at that temperature.) Collect at least 8 gallons (30 L) of wort (or monitor runnings and stop collecting wort when the specific gravity drops below 1.010). Boil wort for 90 minutes (or until volume is reduced to 5 gallons/19 L). Add hops at times indicated in the ingredient list. Ferment at 68–70 °F (20–21 °C). Dry hop for 2 weeks at 35-40 °F (1.6–4.4 °C). Bottle or keg as usual.

Extract with grains option:
Reduce the Maris Otter malt in the all-grain recipe to 1 lb. 10 oz. (0.74 kg) and add 4 lbs. (1.8 kg) Muntons light dried malt extract and 5 lbs. (2.3 kg) Muntons light liquid malt extract. Steep grains at 152 °F (67 °C) in 3 qts. (2.8 L) of water for 1 hour. Boil wort for 90 minutes, adding hops at times indicated. Add dried malt extract at beginning of boil, add liquid malt extract in the final 15 minutes of the boil. Follow the remaining portion of the all-grain recipe.

(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.032 FG = 1.008
IBU = 17 SRM = 12 ABV = 3.1%

Ingredients
5 lbs. (2.3 kg) pale ale malt (2.5 °L)
0.5 lb. (227 g) Carapils® malt (2 °L)
1 lb. (0.45 kg) Munich malt (10 °L)
2 oz. (57 g) chocolate malt (~250 °L)
1 oz. (28 g) black malt (~500 °L)
4.5 AAU Fuggles hops (75 min.) (1 oz./28 g of 4.5% AA)
1 tsp Irish moss
Wyeast 1098 (British Ale), White Labs WLP006 (Bedford Ale) or White Labs WLP025 (Southwold Ale)
1/2 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
For this classic British-style ale use a single step infusion mash of medium thickness at 152 °F (67 °C), which is near the lower end of the diastatic conversion range. This yields more fermentable rather than unfermentable sugars and thus a dryer finish. Let the mash rest for about an hour and then start sparging slowly, for perhaps another hour, until the runnings reach a gravity of about 8 °P (1.008). Sparge with water of roughly 180 °F (82 °C). Check the mash temperature periodically and drop your sparge water temperature if the mash temperature exceeds 170 °F (77 °C).

Boil the wort for about 90 minutes. Add the bittering hops all at once 15 minutes into the boil. You can also split the hops into two equal portions and add the second half anytime between 30 and 60 minutes into the boil. The later you add the second portion of the hops, the more aroma you will get. If you prefer a hoppier brew, you can as much as double any of the hop quantities without harm.

About 10 minutes before shutdown, add 1 teaspoon of Irish moss to the kettle. After shutdown, check the kettle gravity and adjust to reach the beer's original gravity of 8 °P (OG 1.032). Then let the wort rest for about half an hour to allow the trub to settle. Siphon the clarified wort off the debris, heat-exchange it to about 65-70 °F (18-24 °C), aerate the cooled wort and pitch the yeast. Allow the brew to reach terminal gravity (2–3 days or longer). Let stand for another three days to allow the yeast and cold break to settle out. Rack carefully, prime and package. This beer should condition quickly, within a week to 10 days.

Ingredients
3.3 lbs. (1.1 kg) Maris Otter liquid malt extract
1 lb. (0.68 kg) Munich dried malt extract
2 oz. (57 g) chocolate malt
1 oz. (28 g) black malt
4.5 AAU Fuggles hops (1 oz./28 g of 4.5% AA)
1 tsp Irish moss
Wyeast 1098 (British Ale), White Labs WLP006 (Bedford Ale) or White Labs WLP025 (Southwold Ale) yeast
Approx. 1/2-cup priming sugar or DME

Step by Step
Coarsely mill the chocolate and black malts and place them into a muslin bag. Immerse the bag in cold water and heat slowly, for about 30 minutes to 170–190 °F (77–88 ºC).

Discard the bag and mix the liquid with about 4.5 gallons of brewing liquor. Heat the liquor and stir in the two liquid malts. Bring the dissolved malt extract to a boil. Then follow all instructions for the all-grain version.

If you wish to imitate the tannic astringency that would have been present in a traditional partigyle mild from the thin runnings of the mash, boil a pound of un-milled six-row malt in about a gallon (~4 L) of water for about 30 minutes. Strain the grain off the liquid to create an astringent tea. Use the tannic tea as part of the brewing liquor.

Mill the grains and mix with 3.2 gallons (12.1 L) of 164 °F (73 °C) strike water to reach a mash temperature of 152 °F (67 °C). Hold this temperature for 60 minutes. Vorlauf until your runnings are clear. Sparge the grains with 5 gallons (19 L) of water and top up as necessary to obtain 6 gallons (23 L) of wort. Boil the wort for 60 minutes, adding hops according to the ingredient list. Chill the wort to slightly below fermentation temperature, about 52 °F (11 °C). Aerate and pitch the yeast. Ferment at 54 °F (12 °C) until the completion of primary fermentation, then let the temperature rise to 60 °F (16 °C) for a diacetyl rest. Add lime juice and salt to taste — you may want to create a salt water solution to aid in adjustment/evaluation. Crash the beer to 35 °F (2 °C) for 48 hours, and bottle or keg the beer and carbonate to approximately 2.25 volumes. After carbonation, lager at near-freezing temperatures for at least six weeks before serving.

Extract with grains option:
Substitute the Pilsner malt and flaked maize in the all-grain recipe with 4 lbs. (1.8 kg) Pilsen dried malt extract and 1 lb. (0.45 kg) corn sugar. Bring 5.4 gallons (20.4 L) of water to approximately 162 °F (72 °C) and hold there. Steep grains for 15 minutes, then remove bag and allow to drain into the wort. Add dried extract and corn sugar while stirring, and stir until completely dissolved. Boil 60 minutes. Follow the remaining portion of the all-grain recipe.

Tips for Success:
When adding the sea salt and lime juice, start small and build up. They’re easy flavors to overdo, and they should be background notes rather than starring players. Also, if you find that you’re not getting enough citrus kick out of the Amarillo® hops, you can consider adding an additional half-ounce at flame out to boost the tropical/citrus fruit aroma.

0.75 lb. (0.34 kg) wheat malt
0.75 lb. (0.34 kg) rye malt
0.75 lb. (0.34 kg) flaked barley
0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) rice hulls
5.5 AAU Centennial hops (60 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 11% alpha acids)
10 AAU Chinook hops (15 min.) (1 oz./28 g at 10% alpha acids)
10 AAU Chinook hops (0 min.) (1 oz./28 g at 10% alpha acids)
0.2 oz. (6 g) fresh sage (5 min.)
0.2 oz. (6 g) fresh rosemary (5 min.)
0.2 oz. (6 g) fresh thyme (5 min.)
White Labs WLP565 (Belgian Saison) or Wyeast 3724 (Belgian Saison) or Lallemand Belle Saison yeast
1 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Mill the grains, then mix (along with rice hulls) with 4 gallons (15.1 L) of 162 °F (72 °C) strike water to reach a mash temperature of 151 °F (66 °C). Hold this temperature for 60 minutes. Vorlauf until your runnings are clear, and begin sparge. Sparge the grains with 3.4 gallons (13 L) water and top up as necessary to obtain 6.25 gallons (24 L) of wort. Boil for 60 minutes, adding hops and herbs according to the ingredient list. Add kettle fining if desired. After the boil and whirlpool, chill the wort to about 70 °F (21 °C), then pitch yeast.

Once fermentation commences, allow beer to free rise up to 80 °F (27 °C). You can hold this temperature for ten days or until the completion of primary fermentation, whichever is later. Then, reduce temperature to 32 °F (0 °C), and bottle or keg the beer and carbonate to approximately 2.9 volumes.

Step by Step
Bring 5.0 gallons (18.9 L) of water to approximately 165 °F (74 °C) and hold there, steeping the specialty malts in grain bags for 15 minutes. Remove the grain bags, and let drain fully, allowing the dripping to return to the pot. Off heat, add both liquid malt extracts while stirring, and stir until completely dissolved. Bring wort to a boil. Boil for 60 minutes, adding hops and fresh, whole herbs according to the ingredient list. After the boil and whirlpool, chill the wort to slightly below fermentation temperature, about 70 °F (21 °C). Pitch yeast.

Once fermentation commences, allow beer to free rise up to 80 °F (27 °C) for ten days or until the completion of fermentation, whichever is later. Then, reduce temperature to 32 °F (0 °C), and bottle or keg the beer and carbonate to approximately 2.9 volumes.

Tips for success:
Fresh herbs are essential in this recipe. It’s not impossible to make with dried herbs, but the resulting beer will never have the same bright, clean aromas! If you do need to use dried herbs, cut the amounts by about 1⁄2 to try to match intensity.

While there is a dry yeast substitute, it is not going to produce the same beer as the liquid strains. But if the liquid strains are not available, the dry yeast can still produce a very unique and amazing beer. It’s also worth noting that the liquid yeast strains have a tendency to stall out about halfway through fermentation, if not allowed to free rise. If that should happen to you, hold at fermentation temperature (or try to increase slightly) for an additional 10-14 days, and you should see a re-start and completion! If not, consider pitching a clean ale yeast or the recommended dry saison yeast to finish up the job.

Dark, robust, and smoky when young, this porter develops notes of sherry, Madeira, and raisin as it ages. It has a chewy malt character and is chocolaty with a smoky, oily finish.

Ingredients
8.25 lb. (3.74 kg) 2-row pale malt
4 lb. (1.81 kg) Munich malt
12 oz. (0.34 kg) crystal malt (45°L)
11 oz. (0.31 kg) chocolate malt
7 oz. (0.20 kg) black patent malt
10.75 AAU Chinook hops (60 mins) (0.90 oz./25 g of 12% alpha acids)
3.75 AAU Willamette hops (15 mins) (0.75 oz./21 g of 5% alpha acids)
Wyeast 1968 (London ESB Ale) or White Labs WLP002 (English Ale) yeast
3/4 cup (150 g) dextrose (for priming)

Step by Step
Before brew day, smoke 1 pound (0.45 kg) of the Munich malt with alder wood. (Alaskan Brewing Company actually has its grains smoked at Taku Smokeries, a local Juneau smokehouse.) On brew day, mash the grains at 154°F (68°C). Mash out, vorlauf, and then sparge at 170°F (77°C). Boil for 90 minutes, adding the hops at the times indicated in the ingredients list. Pitch the yeast and ferment at 68°F (20°C) until final gravity is reached.

EXTRACT WITH GRAINS OPTION:
Replace the 2-row pale and Munich malts with 2.25 pounds (1.0 kg) dried malt extract, 4.75 pounds (1.25 kg) liquid malt extract, and 1.25 pounds (0.56 kg) Munich malt. Smoke 1 pound (0.45 kg) of the Munich malt. Heat 4.7 quarts (4.4 L) water to 165°F (74°C). Steep the crushed grains at 154°F (68°C) for 45 minutes. Rinse with 3.5 quarts (3.3 L) of water at 170°F (77°C). Add the dried malt extract and water to make 2.5 gallons (9.5 L) of wort.

3⁄4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step

Two or three days before brew day, make a 1-qt. (1-L) yeast starter, aerating the wort thoroughly (preferably with oxygen) before pitching the yeast.

Prepare brewing water starting with RO water and adding 1.5 g/gallon of gypsum, 0.1 g/gallon of calcium chloride, 0.77 g/gallon of Epson salt, and 0.18 g/gallon of sea salt. Treat sparge water with phosphoric acid to a pH of 5.6.

On brew day, mash in the malts at 155 °F (68 °C) with 21 quarts (20 L) of the brewing liquor, and hold this temperature for 60 minutes. Sparge and collect 6.5 gallons (25 L) of wort.

Boil the wort for 60 minutes, adding the hops at times indicated in the recipe. The first wort hops hops go in the kettle prior to the boil. The 0 minute hops get added after the heat is shut off. Give the wort a long stir to create a whirlpool and allow 10 minutes for the wort to settle. Chill to 68 °F (20 °C).

Oxygenate, then pitch the yeast starter. Ferment at 68 °F (20 °C), raising temperature slowly to 74 °F (23 °C) as fermentation slows. Dry hop for 4 days just prior to kegging during a 5-day cool-down period.

Prime and bottle condition, or keg and force carbonate.

Step by Step

Two or three days before brew day, make a 1-qt. (1-L) yeast starter, aerating the wort thoroughly (preferably with oxygen) before pitching the yeast.

Bring 1 gallon (3.8 L) of water in a pot to 160 °F (71 °C). Turn off the heat. Place the crushed Munich and wheat in a grain bag and submerge in the water. Temperature should stabilize around 155 °F (68 °C). Hold this temperature for 45 minutes. Remove grain bag and place in a colander. Wash grains with 1 gallon (3.8 L) of hot water then top off to 6 gallons (23 L).

Off heat, add the liquid and dried malt extract and stir thoroughly to dissolve the extract completely. You do not want to feel liquid extract at the bottom of the kettle when stirring with your spoon. Add the FWH hops. Turn the heat back on and bring to a boil.

Boil the wort for 60 minutes, adding the hops at times indicated in the recipe. For the hops added at flameout, turn off the heat, add the hops, stir the wort to create a whirlpool, then let rest for 10 minutes before chilling to 68 °F (20 °C).

(5 gallons/19 L partial mash)
OG = 1.062 FG = 1.012
IBUs = 37 SRM = 50 ABV = 6.5 %

Ingredients
3.3 lbs. (1.5 kg) Coopers light, unhopped, malt extract
1.3 lbs. (0.6 kg.) Coopers light dried malt extract
1.5 lbs. (0.7 kg) Munich malt
1.5 lb. (0.7 kg) crystal malt (80 ºL)
1 lb. (0.45 kg) chocolate malt
1.5 lb. (0.7 kg) flaked oats
12 oz. (0.3 kg) roasted barley
9 AAU Columbus pellet hops (60 min.) (0.6 oz./ 17 g of 15% alpha acids)
2.25 AAU Northern Brewer pellet hops (5 min.) (0.25 oz./ 7 g of 9% alpha acids)
White Labs WLP007 (Dry English Ale) or Wyeast 1275 (Thames Valley Ale) yeast
3⁄4 cup (150 g) of corn sugar for priming (if bottling)

Step by Step
Steep the crushed Munich malt and flaked oats in 2 gallons (7.6 L) of water at 156 ºF (69 ºC) for 45 minutes. Add the crystal, chocolate malts and roasted barley to the mash and steep for 15 minutes. Remove grains from the wort and rinse with 4 quarts (3.8 L) of hot water. Add the liquid and dry malt extracts and bring to a boil. While boiling, add the hops as per the hopping schedule.

Next, add the wort to 2 gallons (7.6 L) of cold water in a sanitized fermenter and top off with cold water up to 5 gallons (19 L). Cool the wort to 75 ºF (24 ºC). Pitch your yeast and aerate the wort heavily. Cool to 68 ºF (20 ºC). Hold at that temperature until fermentation is complete. Transfer to a carboy, avoiding any splashing to prevent aerating the beer. Let the beer condition for one week and then bottle or keg. Allow to carbonate two weeks and enjoy your Drake’s Crude stout.

All-grain option:
This is a single step infusion mash. Replace the Coopers malt extracts with 7.5 lbs. (3.4 kg) 2-row pale malt. Mix the crushed grain and flaked oats with 3.5 gallons (13 L) of 172 °F (78 °C) water to stabilize at 156 ºF (69 ºC) for 60 minutes. Sparge slowly with 175 ºF (79 ºC) water. Collect approximately 6 gallons (23 L) of wort runoff to boil for 60 minutes. Reduce the 60-minute hop addition to 0.5 oz. (14 g) to allow for the higher utilization factor of a full wort boil.
The remainder of this recipe and procedures are the same as the extract with grain recipe.

(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.058 FG = 1.013
IBU = 27 SRM = 5 ABV = 5.9%

Ingredients
12 lbs. (5.4 kg) Pilsner malt
4.4 AAU German Tettnang hop pellets (90 min.) (1 oz./28 g at 4.4% alpha acids)
4.4 AAU German Tettnang hop pellets (0 min.) (1 oz./28 g at 4.4% alpha acids)

2 packs Wyeast 2124 (Bohemian Lager) or White Labs WLP830 (German Lager) yeast
3⁄4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Mash the grains with 14 qts.
(13 L) hot water to achieve 152–154 °F (66.7–67.8 °C) in the tun. Hold 60 minutes, run off wort and sparge to collect 6 gallons (23 L), and bring to a boil. Add first portion of German Tettnang hops and boil the wort for 90 minutes. When the boil is finished, turn off the heat and add the second portion of German Tettnang and the Saaz hops. Let the wort stand for 30 minutes, run wort off trub, cool to 40–45 °F (4.4–7.2 °C) and pitch yeast, preferably as a 2-qt. (2-L) starter. Maintain this temperature for seven days, then bring up to about 65 oF (18 oC) for 3-4 days (diacetyl rest). Rack to secondary and lager at 32–35 °F (0–2 °C) for three to four weeks, then rack and bottle or keg as usual.

Euro Pale Lager
(5 gallons/19 L, extract only)
OG = 1.057 FG = 1.013
IBU = 27 SRM = 7 ABV = 5.7%

Ingredients
6 lbs. (2.7 kg) Pilsen liquid malt extract
1.5 lbs. (0.68 kg) Pilsen dried malt extract
4.4 AAU German Tettnang hop pellets (90 min.) (1 oz./28 g at 4.4% alpha acids)
4.4 AAU German Tettnang hop pellets (0 min.) (1 oz./28 g at 4.4% alpha acids)
3 AAU Czech Saaz hop pellets (0 min.) (1 oz./28 g at 3% alpha acid)
2 packs Wyeast 2124 (Bohemian Lager) or White Labs WLP830 (German Lager) yeast
3⁄4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Dissolve the dried malt extract (DME) and about one third of the liquid malt extract (LME) in 2–3 gallons (7–11 L) of warm water, stirring carefully to make sure all the extract is properly dissolved, then top up the volume to 5 gallons (19 L). Bring the wort to a boil and add the first portion of Tettnang hops at the start. Boil for 60 minutes, adding the remainder of the LME 15 minutes before the end of the boil. At the end of the boil, turn off the heat, add the second portion of Tettnang and the Saaz hops, and allow the wort to rest for 30 minutes. Let the wort stand for 30 minutes, run off the trub, cool to 40–45 °F (4.4–7.2 °C) and pitch yeast, preferably as a 2 qt. (2 L) starter. Maintain this temperature for 7 days, then bring up to about 65 °F (18 °C) for three to four days (diacetyl rest). Rack to secondary and lager at 32–35 °F (0–2 °C) for three to four weeks, then rack and bottle or keg as usual.

Tips for Success:
You could do a decoction mash with this if you wish — this recipe is about the hops after all. A decoction mash would be historically accurate, and might produce some subtle differences, but I find a simple infusion works well as long as you choose a good quality Pilsner malt. For more about performing a decoction mash, visit https://byo.com/story537. For extract brewers, be sure to choose high quality malts that you know are fresh.

Be sure to ferment this with a healthy population of yeast. For the yeast strains suggested here, shoot for around 400 billion cells, which is easily achieved by making a simple yeast starter 24 hours before brew day. If you do not want to make a starter, you can also use multiple yeast packs.

If a cold creamy glass of chocolate milk (or, perhaps, a smooth glass of chocolate milk stout) is a reliable throwback to the more innocent days of childhood, Evil Genius’ Purple Monkey Dishwasher is a twist on a more indulgent morning treat. Chocolate and peanut butter are natural complements, layering rich and roasty on top of savory and salty. This recipe spins the standard chocolate stout base in an even more indulgent direction, though without pushing flavor profiles as extreme as, say, a pastry stout. Since peanut butter is still a smoother, more savory flavor, no one should find this recipe too over-the-top. Though that’s certainly an option too. For those wishing to punch things up several more notches, consider that other classic pairing with peanut butter: Jelly. Once brewers have this baseline recipe dialed in, they should find themselves with a perfect foundation for layering ripe fruit flavors on top of a chocolaty porter base.

Mash grains at 154 °F (68 °C) for 60 minutes. Begin lautering by bringing the mash up to a mash-out temperature of 168 °F (70 °F) and hold for 10 minutes. Begin recirculating, vorlaufing until the wort runs clear then direct runoff to the boil kettle.

Boil for 60 minutes adding the hops as indicated in the ingredients list. Chill wort and ferment at 70 °F (21 °C) for one week.

When the beer has finished primary fermentation, transfer to secondary if desired and then add chocolate and peanut butter extracts. Allow two to three days for flavors to integrate. After this time, transfer to keg or bottle condition.

Fairgate Gingerbread Stout
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.088 FG = 1.021
IBU = 51 SRM = 50 ABV = 9%

Ingredients
8.8 lbs. (4 kg) North American 2-row malt
2.1 lbs. (0.95 kg) Munich malt
13 oz. (370 g) flaked oats
13 oz. (370 g) Carapils® (dextrin) malt
1.1 lbs. (0.5 kg) black barley (500 °L)
11 oz. (310 g) crystal malt (60 °L)
8.5 oz. (240 g) Special B malt
8 oz. (230 g) crystal malt (40 °L)
5.5 oz. (155 g) crystal malt (120 °L)
2 lbs. (0.9 kg) molasses (60 min.)
18.2 AAU Magnum hops (60 min.) (1.3 oz./37 g at 14% alpha acids)
1 Whirlfloc tablet (15 min.)
1 tsp. yeast nutrient (15 min.)
spice tincture #1 (10 min.)
spice tincture #2 (secondary)
Wyeast 1318 (London Ale III), White Labs WLP066 (London Fog), or LalBrew Verdant IPA yeast
2⁄3 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Spice tincture ingredients
6 g vanilla beans, Grade B (split scraped, sectioned)
60 g ginger root (coarse grind with skin in food processor)
8 whole allspice berries (coarse grind)
2 tsp. cinnamon stick (coarse grind)
2 whole cloves (coarse grind)
1 tsp. whole nutmeg (coarse grind)
Vodka to cover

Step by Step
Create spice tincture five days prior to brewing. To do this, add spices to a glass jar, cover with vodka, screw on lid, shake to mix thoroughly. This tincture will be divided into two equal amounts and account for both tincture additions (or split the ingredients into two jars from the start and make two separate tinctures).

On brew day, starting with reverse osmosis water, add salts toward a dark brown beer profile — sulfate:chloride ratio of about 0.7. Mash in pale, Munich, flaked oats, and Carapils® via underlet to stabilize temperature at 150 °F (66 °C), then wait 30 minutes. Add remaining grains to top of mash after 30 minutes, shallow mix these grains into the mash. Vorlauf for 30 minutes then transfer wort to boil kettle and boil. Add molasses, hops, kettle fining, and yeast nutrient per ingredients list. For the first spice tincture — add the spices to a strainer bag, place it into boil at 10 minutes remaining. Do not discard the vodka. Pour in vodka at flameout. Whirlpool for 15 minutes.

Chill the wort and transfer to fermenter. Pitch yeast at 68 °F (20 °C) and hold temperature for the duration of active fermentation. After one week drop yeast cone (or rack to secondary) and add second tincture (both the spices and vodka) into fermenter. Let stand for at least one week. Force carbonate to 2.3 v/v or bottle and prime with corn sugar.

Partial mash option: Replace the pale malt with 6.6 lbs. (3 kg) of light liquid malt extract and reduce the Munich malt to 1.5 lbs. (0.68 kg). The steps will nearly parallel the all-grain instructions. Place the Munich malt, flaked oats, and Carapils® in a muslin bag and steep in 2 gallons (7.6 L) of water at 150 °F (66 °C) for 30 minutes. Place the remaining grains in a separate bag and add these grains for the remaining 30 minutes of the mash. Place both bags in a large colander and wash with 1.5 gallons (5.7 L) of hot water. While heat is turned off, stir the liquid malt extract and molasses into the wort. Stir until fully dissolved then top up to 6 gallons (23 L) and bring the wort up to a boil.

Follow the remainder of the all-grain recipe instructions.

Fair Isle Brewing’s Madame R. Galle clone
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.044 FG = 1.000
IBU = 32 SRM = 2.5 ABV = 6%

Ingredients
6 lbs. (2.7 kg) Pilsner malt
2.75 lbs. (1.25 kg) white wheat malt
0.25 lb. (113 g) acidulated malt
4 AAU Hallertau Mittelfrüh hops (90 min.) (1 oz./28 g at 4% alpha acids)
12 AAU Hallertau Mittelfrüh hops (10 min.) (3 oz./85 g at 4% alpha acids)
8 AAU Hallertau Mittelfrüh hops (5 min.) (2 oz./57 g at 4% alpha acids)
1 Whirlfloc tablet
White Labs WLP568 (Belgian Style Saison Ale Yeast Blend) or equivalent
White Labs WLP645 (Brettanomyces Claussenii) or equivalent
White Labs WLP665 (Flemish Ale Blend) or equivalent (optional)
1 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Seattle water is very soft, so the best advice is to start with reverse osmosis water and build in salts to match Fair Isle’s. Shoot for roughly 90–100 ppm calcium, 100 ppm sulfate, 65–70 ppm chloride. This can be accomplished by adding 1.25 g CaCl2, 1.75 g gypsum dissolved into mash water then adding 0.75 g CaCl2 and 1.05 g gypsum in the boil kettle at start of boil (if using very soft or reverse osmosis water).

Employ either a single infusion mash at 148 °F (64 °C) for 60 minutes total at 1.25 qts./lb. (2.6 L/kg) or, to closer replicate the brewery’s methods, a two-step mash at 145 °F (63 °C) for 30 minutes at 1 qt./lb. (2.1 L/kg) followed by an infusion to bring mash up to 155 °F (68 °C) for 30 minutes at 1.3 qts./lb. (2.7 L/kg). Once converted, recirculate for about ten minutes then raise the temperature to 168 °F (76 °C) for mashout. Sparge with 170 °F (77 °C) water near a pH of 5.2 and collect about 7 gallons (26.5 L) of wort.

Boil for 90 minutes, adding first hop addition (and those remaining kettle salts) once boil is achieved. Add other hop additions and fining agents as indicated. When the boil is complete, whirlpool for 20 minutes, then chill as quickly as possible to 75 °F (24 °C).

Ferment with your own mixed culture blend. A co-pitch mainly consisting of Belgian Style Saison Ale Yeast Blend (containing the Saison Dupont strain, among others), your favorite fruitier Brettanomyces strain is ideal, and very minor addition of Lactobacillus and Pediococcus strains are optional, but will likely add complexity, allowing the beer to slowly pick up acidity over time. Note: Funky and phenolic Brett strains are not advised. Also, we do recommend you oxygenate the wort, but a bit less than you normally would.

Let fermentation free rise as high as, but no higher than 95 °F (35 °C). Mid to upper 80s °F (30–32 °C) is ideal. Primary ferment for 6–8 weeks, longer if desired. The goal is to get this beer as dry as possible with a stable gravity of 1.002 or lower. Bottle condition with your preferred sugar source to 3–3.5 volumes. Thicker, Champagne-style green bottles are ideal. Naturally condition and wait a minimum of 6–8 weeks for best results. Embrace the skunk!

(5 gallons/19 L, extract only)
OG = 1.044 FG = 1.000
IBU = 32 SRM = 2.5 ABV = 6.2%

Ingredients
3.4 lbs. (1.5 kg) Pilsen dried malt extract
1.5 lbs. (.68 kg) wheat dried malt extract
1/2 tsp. 88% lactic acid
4 AAU Hallertau Mittelfrüh hops (90 min.) (1 oz./28 g at 4% alpha acids)
12 AAU Hallertau Mittelfrüh hops (10 min.) (3 oz./85 g at 4% alpha acids)
8 AAU Hallertau Mittelfrüh hops (5 min.) (2 oz./57 g at 4% alpha acids)
1 Whirlfloc tablet
White Labs WLP568 (Belgian Style Saison Ale Yeast Blend) or equivalent
White Labs WLP645 (Brettanomyces Claussenii) or equivalent
White Labs WLP665 (Flemish Ale Blend) or equivalent (optional)
1 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Raise 3 gallons (11 L) of water to near boiling temperature and slowly stir in half of each of the dry malt extracts and lactic acid. Return to the heat source and raise to boil. Boil for 60 minutes adding the hops at their scheduled intervals, Whirlfloc at 10 minutes remaining, and the rest of the extract with 5 minutes remaining. Meanwhile, boil and chill about 2.5 gallons (9.5 L) of water so you can top up your wort in the fermenter.

When the boil is complete, whirlpool for 20 minutes, then chill as quickly as possible to 75 °F (24 °C), and top up to 5 gallons (19 L). Follow the all-grain recipe for fermentation and packaging instructions.

Tips For Success:
According to former Head Brewer Nick Pauley, "When starting with very soft water, think of the mash salts as pH balance and enzyme protection, and the kettle salts as a flavor addition and yeast health insurance. You typically lose a good chunk of your calcium after mashing so best to add more calcium to the boil to hit your target ppm and balance salts to your desired chloride:sulfate ratio."

"Crafting a beer like this takes a lot of patience," said Pauley. "Sit back and wait for it to go through its paces. Up until 5–6 weeks into primary fermentation, it is very clovey and bubble gummy; checking on it prematurely can be misleading. Give the microbes the time they need to do their thing during secondary and tertiary fermentation.

Some may call this recipe a "zero IBU IPA" as no hops are added in the boil.
Of course, whirlpool and dip hop additions will contribute both bitterness
and IBUs when measured using a
spectrophotometer.

Ingredients
8.5 lbs. (3.9 kg) Rahr North Star PilsTM malt
3 lbs. (1.4 kg) Rahr white wheat malt
1.25 lbs. (0.57 kg) Simpsons malted oats
1 lb. (0.45 kg) rice hulls
3 oz. (85 g) Strata® hops (0 min.)
3 oz. (85 g) Strata® hops (dip hop)
2 oz. (57 g) Mosaic® Cryo hops (dry hop 1)
2 oz. (57 g) Citra® Cryo hops (dry hop 1)
3 oz. (85 g) Strata® hops (dry hop 2)
1⁄2 tsp. yeast nutrient (10 min.)
White Labs WLP013 (London Ale) or Wyeast 1028 (London Ale) or
SafAle S-04 yeast
3⁄4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Mill the grains and dough-in targeting a mash of around 1.25 quarts of water to 1 pound of grain (2.6 L/kg) and a mash temperature of 150 °F (66 °C). While waiting for the run-off and boil to begin add 3 oz. (85 g) of Strata® "dip hops" directly to a clean, sanitized fermenter.

Total boil time is 60 minutes. No hops will be added until post-boil. With 30 minutes left in the boil, run un-hopped wort to the fermentation vessel with the Strata® hops at 170 °F (77 °C) until the hops are aggressively submerged (~0.5–1 gallon/2–4 L). Seal the fermenter with an airlock as soon as possible. Continue to boil the remaining wort. At 60 minutes turn off the heat and pitch your flameout addition and whirlpool for 20 minutes.

Chill the wort to lower than the target fermentation temperature. Once all the wort is in the fermenter, adjust the wort volume as needed to 5.5 gallons (21 L) and the wort temperature to 68 °F (20 °C), then aerate thoroughly and pitch yeast. Pitch rate is 1,000,000 cells per mL per degree Plato. Ferment at this temperature.

Track the gravity daily and at approximately 1.018 specific gravity dry hop with 2 oz. (57 g) each Mosaic® Cryo pellets and Citra® Cryo pellets.

Forty-eight hours later add 3 oz. (85 g) Strata® as the second dry hop. Track gravity until the beer is at terminal gravity. Chill the beer and carbonate the beer to around 2.5 volumes of CO2.

Fast Mead
FAST MEAD
(5 gallons/19 L)
OG = 1.126 FG = 1.035
ABV = 13.9%

This is a simple and straightforward mead recipe that should have your fermentation finished within a few weeks.

Ingredients
18 lbs. (8.2 kg) Orange blossom honey
2 packages Lalvin 71B-1122 Narbonne yeast
12.5 g Go-Ferm (when hydrating)
6.2 g Fermaid-K (at 24 hours)
6.2 g Fermaid-K (at 48 hours)
6.2 g Fermaid-K (at 72 hours)
6.2 g Fermaid-K (at 7 days or the 1⁄3 left sugar break)
1 package Super Kleer KC Finings
0.3 tsp. potassium metabisulfite

Step by step

Add honey to 3 gallons (11 L) of room temperature water in a large (8- to 10-gallon/30- to 37-L) fermenter. Stir the honey and water mixture well and top up with enough water to make 4.7 gallons (18 L), saving a liter of space for your yeast.

Prepare the yeast by adding it to a liter (0.2 gal.) of warm water at about 104 °F (40 °C). Add 1.25 grams of Go-Ferm per gram of yeast. Slowly bring the temperature of the mixture down to the temperature of your mead must by adding small quantities of must. When the temperature is acclimated, add the yeast slurry to the fermenter and stir vigorously.

Monitor your pH throughout fermentation. If the pH drops below 3.4 add an alkaline additive, such as potassium bicarbonate, to raise the pH back above 3.4. Degas the must during fermentation using a wine whip regularly until about 2⁄3 of the sugar has fermented away. Add your fermentation nutrients at the intervals indicated in the ingredients list. Following primary fermentation, add potassium metabisulfite, and fine your mead with Super Kleer. When your mead is fined to your satisfaction, you can bottle or keg, carbonating if you choose.

4 lbs. (1.8 kg) Fawcett Pearl pale ale malt
1.2 lbs. (0.54 kg) chocolate malt
1.1 lbs. (0.49 kg) Munich malt (10 °L)
9.6 oz. (0.27 kg) brown malt
8.8 oz. (0.25 kg) Carapils® malt
7.2 oz. (0.2 kg) crystal malt (120 °L)
2.9 oz. (82 g) Briess Midnight Wheat malt
2.6 oz. (73 g) debittered black malt
2.6 oz. (73 g) roasted barley
9 AAU Magnum hops (60 min.) (0.75 oz./21 g at 12% alpha acids)

¾ cup corn sugar (if priming)

STEP BY STEP
Using a fairly thick mash, achieve a single infusion mash temperature of 150 °F (66 °C). Hold at this temperature for 60 minutes or until converted. It is advisable to hold the highly roasted grains (chocolate, Midnight Wheat, black malt, and roasted barley) until you are ready to recirculate to reduce astringency. Start lautering by raising the mash temperature up to 168 °F (66 °C), then hold for ten minutes. Add the roasted and crystal grains then recirculate. Vorlauf until your runnings are clear before starting to collect. Since you are doing a 90-minute boil, collect about 7 gallons (26.5 L) of wort. Add the hops as stated in the recipe.

Upon completion of the boil, chill the wort to 65 °F (18 °C), pitch a healthy count of yeast and oxygenate thoroughly. When fermentation is about ⅔ complete (at 1.040), let temperature free rise to 67 °F (19 °C).

Total fermentation time should be at least two weeks so the yeast has time to clean up off-flavors. Keg and carbonate to 2.6 v/v or bottle.

FAT HEAD’S IMPERIAL PORTER CLONE
(5 gallons/19 L, partial mash)
OG = 1.086 FG = 1.024
IBU = 50 SRM = 56 ABV = 8.6%

INGREDIENTS
3.3 lbs. (1.52 kg) Muntons Maris Otter light liquid malt extract
2.4 lbs. (1.1 kg) Pilsen dried malt extract
2.16 lbs. (1.1 kg) pale ale dried malt extract
1.2 lbs. (0.54 kg) chocolate malt
1.1 lbs. (0.49 kg) Munich malt (10 °L)
9.6 oz. (0.27 kg) brown malt
8.8 oz. (0.25 kg) Carapils® malt
7.2 oz. (0.2 kg) crystal malt (120 °L)
2.9 oz. (82 g) Briess Midnight Wheat malt
2.6 oz. (73 g) debittered black malt
2.6 oz. (73 g) roasted barley
9 AAU Magnum hops (60 min.) (0.75 oz./21 g at 12% alpha acids)
6.9 AAU Simcoe® hops (30 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 13.8% alpha acids)
6.2 AAU Mosaic® hops (5 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 12.4% alpha acids)
White Labs WLP013 (London Ale), Wyeast 1028 (London Ale), or
Lallemand Nottingham yeast
¾ cup corn sugar (if priming)

STEP BY STEP
Heat 3 gallons (11.4 L) of water in your mash tun and add only the Munich and brown malts (in a muslin bag) for mashing. Achieve a mash temperature of 150 °F (66 °C). Hold at this temperature for 60 minutes or until converted. With about 10 minutes to go during the initial mash, add all the roasted grains (in a separate muslin bag). These grains do not need to be mashed and adding them later may help reduce astringency from the highly kilned malts.

After mash is completed, let the liquid drain from the grain bags, remove bags, then increase temperature to near-boiling. Remove from the heat source and slowly stir in all the malt extracts. Be sure extract is fully dissolved, then return to the heat source and boil for 60 minutes adding hops as indicated in the ingredients list. (Note: a 90-minute boil is not necessary to drive off DMS since that takes place during the extract’s creation process.)

Upon completion of the boil, chill the wort to 65 °F (18 °C) and top up your fermenter to a total of 5 gallons (19 L) with pre-boiled, pre-chilled water. Pitch a healthy count of yeast and oxygenate thoroughly. When fermentation is about ⅔ complete (at 1.040), let temperature free rise to 67 °F (19 °C). Total fermentation time should be at least two weeks so the yeast has time to clean up off-flavors. Keg and carbonate to 2.6 v/v or bottle.

Tips for success:
According to Brewmaster Matt Cole, the non-traditional addition of roasted barley adds a nice level of complexity to balance the chocolate flavors of the other dark malts.

He suggests Crisp and Simpson’s malts as the best choices for the character malts for this beer due to their high quality and flavor profile.

Fermented French Fries
Fermented French Fries
Ingredients
2 medium / large potatoes
Salt (2% brine)

Step by step
While fermenting potatoes and then later cooking them as French fries might seem like a slightly paradoxical way to enjoy a fermented food, I’ve always enjoyed the concept of this recipe as much for what it conveys as well as for how it tastes. Fermentation is useful for preservation, of course. But less frequently discussed is the fact that fermentation also breaks down complex sugars and starches and generally makes foods easier for our bodies to process. Probiotics get all the mainstream buzz, but fermentation also makes foods healthier by unlocking nutrients that our own bodies wouldn’t have access to on their own. Many such foods, like beans and starchy vegetables, don’t require a full fermentation. Usually a day or two of brining is sufficient to begin the breakdown.

French fries made from fermented potatoes are not only easier to digest, but more flavorful as well. Fermentation adds a tangy dimension that really complements the saltiness of French fries, creating a flavor dynamic similar to salt and vinegar chips. The longer you ferment the funkier the fries will be, of course, but I usually prefer to toss these in the oven after two or three days of fermentation.

The process is quite simple: Wash the potatoes with cold water to remove any dirt, then cut them up into French fry style wedges. How thick you cut the wedges is entirely up to you. Pack the potato wedges into a jar and fill with a 2% salt water brine (1 teaspoon salt per cup of water). Allow to ferment for two or three days, then remove the potatoes from the brine and give them an hour or so to air dry. After this, you can bake or fry them as you would any other French fry, though they may need less time cooking than normal fries. Keep in mind that fermented French fries have already been salted, so you will likely want to hold off on adding any more salt until after you’ve cooked and tasted them. Additional spices can be added either during the fermentation process, or upon serving.

And, as pictured above, this same recipe works great for sweet potato fries as well!

Fermented Hot Sauce 
Fermented Hot Sauce
Ingredients
3.2 oz. (90 g) chili peppers
1⁄2 Tbsp. sea salt
1⁄2 Tbsp. honey
Splash of apple cider vinegar

Step by step
While most hot sauces sitting on grocery store shelves these days are vinegar-based, fermented hot sauces are actually a lot more common than you may think. Fermented condiments in general have been around for a very long time, probably as long as any fermented food. Even today, a few popular brands like Tobasco and styles like sriracha are still made using fermentation, rather than vinegar. While vinegar hot sauces can be bright and punchy, fermented hot sauces unsurprisingly tend to play up the funk and complexity.

Fermented hot sauce may be my favorite ferment to make at home, simply because of how versatile and forgiving it is. Both managing fermentation and winging a recipe on the fly are simple tasks, and the resulting flavors can be unlike anything you’ll find in the average store. Even better, fermented hot sauce lasts a long, long time — I’ve had half-empty bottles that stayed vibrant and flavorful for years.

The recipe given here is bare bones, because as with most fermented foods, you can modify the recipe to push it in just about any direction you want. For a first attempt, however, I recommend a mix of habanero and serrano peppers. Not only are these readily available in almost all grocery stores, they’re easy to find fresh at farmers markets, and make for a hot sauce with good flavor and a moderate but manageable heat level. With any hot sauce, the heat can always be dialed down by blending in a bit of bell pepper (use whatever type of bell pepper best matches the color of the rest of your peppers). Peppers, like hops, are a lot of fun to mix and match, and testing out an obscure rare pepper variety on its own in a hot sauce can be every bit as satisfying as a single-hop IPA.

As for the process, I like to keep things simple. Blend the peppers, salt, and honey until they are the consistency of salsa, then pour into your fermentation vessel. Top off with a splash of apple cider vinegar so that the liquid level is above the solid veggies. Allow two weeks to ferment, then blend again, to create a finer, more sauce-like consistency. Additional vinegar or salt brine can be added if the hot sauce is still too thick. A dash of extra salt can also ensure that the hot sauce keeps for a long time. At this point, you can pour the sauce back into the same vessel, or you can even transfer to hot sauce bottles at this stage. While the hot sauce should now be ready to consume, I usually prefer to age my hot sauces at room temperature for several months before I begin to use them. The flavor will continue to develop, and the heat mellows and integrates with the flavor of the sauce over time. For the first month of aging, however, be sure not to tighten the lid of the jar or bottles all the way. More CO2 will be released as the ferment continues to condition.

Festbier is the Best Bier
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.057 FG = 1.012
IBU = 28 SRM = 7 ABV = 5.9%

A traditional festbier to be enjoyed by the liter during Oktoberfest or any fall festivities.

Ingredients
6 lbs. (2.7 kg) Pilsner malt
6 lbs. (2.7 kg) German Munich I malt (6 ºL)
6.5 AAU Perle hops (60 min.) (1 oz./28 g at 6.5% alpha acids)
2.3 AAU Hallertauer Tradition hops (10 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 5.5% alpha acids)
Yeast nutrients (10 min.)
Whirlfloc (10 min.)
White Labs WLP830 (German Lager), Wyeast 2124 (Bohemian Lager), or SafLager W-34/70 yeast
¾ cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by step
If using liquid yeast, make a yeast starter two days prior to brew day. For your water, treat 10 gallons (38 L) of reverse osmosis water with 1⁄2 tsp. lactic acid for mash acidification, 1 g gypsum, 1 g Epsom salt, and 5 g calcium chloride.

Step mash with a 30-minute beta rest at 140–144 °F (60–62 °C) followed by a 30-minute alpha rest at 158–162 °F (70-72 °C). Lauter as normal.

Sparge to collect 6.5 gallons (25 L) of wort once your mash has reached conversion. Boil for 75 minutes adding hops, nutrients, and kettle fining per schedule. After the boil, cool wort, pitch plenty of yeast, and aerate well if using a liquid yeast strain. Ferment between 46–48 °F (8–10 °C) until primary fermentation is finished (7–9 days), then lager for 4 weeks around 32 °F (0 °C). Spunding is ideal when it comes to carbonation. Aim for 2.4–2.5 volumes of CO2.

Extract only option: Replace the grains with 4.33 lbs. (2 kg) Pilsen dried malt extract and 2 lbs. (0.91 kg) Munich dried malt extract. Follow instructions in the Monks’ Fortitude extract with grains option.

1⁄2 Whirlfloc® tablet
White Labs WLP013 (London Ale) or Wyeast 1028 (London Ale) or Lallemand Nottingham yeast
3⁄4 cup (150 g) dextrose (if priming)

Step by Step
This is a multi-step infusion mash. Mix the crushed grains with 3.5 gallons (13 L) of water to stabilize the mash at 145 °F (66 °C) and hold for 60 minutes. Raise temperature of mash to 155 °F (68 °C) and hold for 15 minutes. Raise the mash to 168 °F (76 °C) and begin to lauter. Collect 6.5 gallons (24.6 L) of wort to begin your 60 minute boil. Add hops per the schedule in the ingredients list, adding the final hop addition just after turning off the heat. At the end of the boil, you should have 5.5 gallons (21 L) in your kettle. After the boil, give your wort a stir to create a whirlpool, then let the wort settle for 30 minutes prior to chilling. Cool your wort to 66 °F (20 °C) for fermenting, aerate well, then pitch your yeast along with the oak cubes. After seven days, rack the beer into a secondary vessel, then add the dry hops and wait 3–4 days. Bottle or keg as usual.

Extract with grains option:
Substitute the 2-row pale malt, British pale malt, and Munich malt in the all-grain recipe with 2.5 lbs. (1.13 kg) extra light dried malt extract and 3.3 lbs. (1.5 kg) Maris Otter liquid malt extract. Place crushed grains in a muslin bag. Begin heating 2 gallons (7.6 L) of water. Place the grain bag in the water when the temperature hits 160 °F (71 °C) and hold for 20 minutes. Remove the grain bag and wash with 2 qts. (2 L) of hot water. If your kettle can hold the water, top off to 6.5 gallons (24.6 L) and add all the malt extract. If your kettle can only do a partial boil, then add the liquid malt extract during the final 15 minutes of the boil. Total boil time is 60 minutes. Follow the remaining portion of the all-grain recipe

Tips for Success:
The team at Firestone Walker Brewing Co. created one of the only, if not the only, union brewing method in the United States. Inspired by the Burton union systems made popular by the breweries in Burton-Upon-Trent, Firestone Walker Brewing Co. dubbed their barrel union the "Firestone Union." Using 60-gallon (227-L) American oak barrels, 20% of Double Barrel Ale is barrel-fermented for 6 days in these barrels before being blended back into the main batch. The remaining 80% is fermented in stainless conicals. This system makes it nearly impossible to duplicate the Firestone Union process at home. Instead homebrewers can opt to add 1 oz. (28 g) of American oak cubes in primary fermentation to simulate the barrel fermentation profile. Unfortunately for most of us, the only place to try Double Barrel Ale in its unblended, 100% barrel fermented state is at their brewery in Paso Robles or their Taproom Restaurant in Buellton. But that taste (and the rest of Firestone Walker’s stellar lineup of beers) is certainly worth a pilgrimage!

Matt Brynildson is known for dry hopping his beers prior to the termination of primary fermentation to try to take advantage of biotransformations, which hop oils can undergo in the presence of yeast. The goal is to add the hops with just a few gravity points left in fermentation. Also be aware of "beer volcanoes" as the hops can create a nucleation point to release dissolved CO2, creating a volcano effect on the beer, which can lead to a significant amount of beer loss and a giant mess. If you do go ahead with this form of dry hopping, be aware of this potential downfall.

Once this is complete add the milled acidulated malt and continue mashing for an additional 20 minutes (60 minutes total mash time). Rinse the grains with about 1 gallon (4 L) of hot water. Top off your kettle to 6 gallons (23 L) pre-boil volume (or as high as you can without fear of boil-over problems). Add the dried malt extract and bring to a boil. Boil the wort for 60 minutes adding the hops at the times indicated in the ingredients list.

After the boil, turn off the heat and chill the wort to about 65 °F (18 °C), transfer the wort to the fermenter, top off to 5 gallons (19 L), aerate and pitch the yeast. Ferment at 68 °F (20 °C) for four days and add the raspberry purée. Ferment for an additional seven days, rack to a secondary fermenter for additional clearing if desired, and then bottle or keg the beer and carbonate.

Tips for Success:
In order to give this beer the desired tartness, Funkwerks does a fermentation of the wort with Lactobacillus for 24 hours until they hit their target acidity before boiling. Although this can be attempted at home by the adventurous homebrewer, an alternative method using acidulated malt has been provided to simplify the process. The brewer suggests adding the acidulated malt in the last 20 minutes of the mash to ensure the mash pH does not drop too low.

1.2 lbs. (0.54 kg) corn sugar (15 min.)
4 mL HopShot™ (60 min.)
1.5 oz. (43 g) Citra® hops (0 min.)
2.5 oz. (71 g) Mosaic® hops (0 min.)
2.5 oz. (71 g) Citra® hops (dry hop)
1.5 oz. (43 g) Mosaic® hops (dry hop)
The Yeast Bay (Vermont Ale), GigaYeast GY054 (Vermont IPA), East Coast Yeast ECY29 (North East Ale), Omega Yeast Labs (DIPA Ale), or LalBrew New England Ale yeast
3/4 cups (150 g) dextrose (if priming)

Step by Step
This recipe is designed for homebrewers to achieve 5.5 gallons (21 L) wort in their fermenter on brew day. This will help offset the loss of volume to the heavy hopping rate of this beer. Build your water profile, starting with either very soft water or RO water. Target a water profile of 250:100 PPM sulfate: chloride. Crush the malt and add to 4 gallons (15 L) strike water to achieve a stable mash temperature at 154 °F (68 °C). Hold at this temperature for 60 minutes. Raise to mash out at 168 °F (76 °C) and begin to vorlauf. Collect about 7 gallons (26.5 L) of wort in your kettle and bring to a boil. Boil for 60 minutes, adding the HopShot™ addition after the wort comes to a boil and the corn sugar with 15 minutes left in the boil. After you turn off the heat, add the final addition of hops, then stir the wort and let settle for 30 minutes with the lid on before cooling to yeast pitching temperature. Ferment at 68 °F (20 °C). As fermentation nears completion, transfer the beer to a keg and add the dry hops and attach a spunding valve. Let the beer sit on the hops for 3–4 days, then transfer to a serving keg or bottling bucket. Bottle with priming sugar or force carbonate the serving keg to 2.4 volumes CO2.

Extract with grains option:
Substitute the Thomas Fawcett Pearl malt in the all-grain recipe with 6.6 lbs. (3 kg) Maris Otter liquid malt extract and 1.2 lbs. (0.54 kg) Pilsen dried malt extract. Heat 5 gallons (19 L) soft or reverse osmosis water up to boil. As soon as the water begins to boil, remove from heat and stir in the liquid and dried malt extracts. Stir until all the extract is dissolved then return the wort to a boil. Boil for 60 minutes. Follow the remaining portion of the all-grain recipe.

Step by Step

Mill grains and mix with 6 gallons (23 L) of 156 °F (69 °C) strike water and optional brewing salts to reach a mash temperature of 145 °F (63 °C). Hold this temperature for 15 minutes. Raise the temperature to 155 °F (68 °C) and hold for 30 minutes. Raise the temperature to a mash out of 168 °F (75 °C). Vorlauf until your runnings are clear. Sparge the grains with enough 168 °F (75 °C) water to collect 6 gallons (23 L) of 1.063 SG wort. Boil for 60 minutes, adding hops according to the ingredients list. Turn off the heat and chill the wort to slightly below fermentation temperature, about 66 °F (19 °C). Aerate the wort with pure oxygen or filtered air and pitch the yeast. Ferment at 68 °F (20 °C). After 4 days of fermentation add the first dry hop addition. After 7 days fermentation add the second dry hop addition. Once at terminal gravity (approximately 10 days) bottle or keg the beer and carbonate.

Partial mash option:
Substitute the 2-row malt in the all-grain recipe with 7 lbs. (3.2 kg) extra light dried malt extract. Place the milled rye malt in a muslin bag and steep in 4 quarts (3.8 L) of 149 °F (65 °C) water for 45 minutes. Remove the grain and rinse with 1 gallon (3.8 L) of hot water. Add the roasted and caramel malts in a second bag and steep for 15 minutes. Remove that grain bag, then add water to reach a volume of 5.4 gallons (20.4 L) and heat to boiling. Turn off the heat, add the liquid malt extract and optional brewing salts, and stir until completely dissolved. Top up if necessary to obtain 6 gallons (23 L) of 1.063 wort. Boil 60 minutes, and follow the remainder of the all-grain recipe.

This English-style barleywine from Firestone Walker (Paso Robles, California) is aged in recently emptied Bourbon barrels to pick up flavors and alcohol from the Bourbon. While this beer goes into the barrel around 10% ABV, it comes out above 12%.

Ingredients

14 lbs. (6.3 kg) pale malt
1.38 lbs. (0.63 kg) Munich malt
0.75 lb. (0.34 kg) crystal malt (60 °L)
0.25 lb. (113 g) crystal malt (120 °L)
0.25 lb. (113 g) roasted barley
1.25 lbs. (0.57 kg) dextrose sugar (10 min.)
1⁄2 tsp. yeast nutrients
4.9 AAU German Magnum hops (90 min.) (0.35 oz./10 g at 14% alpha acids)
9.7 AAU Willamette hops (30 min.) (1.85 oz./52g at 5.25% alpha acids)
1.25 oz. (35g) Willamette hops (0 min.)
1 oak barrel or 1-2 oz. (28-57 g) medium toasted oak chips, soaked in spirits
Wyeast 1098 (London Ale) or White Labs WLP013 (London Ale) or Lallemand Nottingham yeast
3⁄4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Use reverse osmosis water and adjust with equal parts calcium sulfate and calcium chloride to achieve a minimum of 100 ppm finished calcium. Begin heating 5.2 gallons (19.7 L), about 1.25 qts./lb. (2.6 L/kg) strike water, up to 157 °F (69 °C). Mash in at 145 °F (63 °C), rest for 30 minutes to aid in creating a high attenuation wort. Ramp up to 152 °F (66 °C) and rest for 15 min or until fully converted (or employ a single infusion mash at 152 °F/66 °C). Ramp up to 168 °F (76 °C) to begin lautering. Sparge with about 4 gallons (15 L) water to collect roughly 6.75 gallons (25.4 L) of wort. The gravity of the pre-boil wort should be roughly 1.065 SG. Boil 90 minutes, adding hops and dextrose at times indicated. Brewmaster Matt Brynildson suggests, instead of a longer boil, using malt extract to make up any additional gravity points if needed.

Chill, aerate, and pitch yeast at 62 °F (17 °C). Ferment at 66 °F (19 °C). Pitch a healthy and viable yeast starter or freshly harvested yeast.Near the end of fermentation, raise the temperature a few degrees. Transfer the beer into a Bourbon barrel if you can and allow to age until the taste is to your liking. Otherwise, using 1-2 oz. (28-57 g) of medium toasted oak chips, soaked in a favorite spirit for several weeks during primary fermentation can help mimic those barrel flavors in secondary. Carbonate to 2.5 volumes CO2.

Tips for success:
"We barrel age all of our barleywines here at Firestone Walker. Typically, the beer ages one full year in spirits barrels (bourbon, rum or Scotch) at 50 °F (10 °C). Barrels must be freshly dumped (recently emptied at the distillery). They are received at the brewery and put into service as soon as possible. The barrels are purged well of any air (oxygen free) and filled to the top, then hard bunged and put into the cool cellar to rest. We typically pick up some alcohol from the barrels, which along with the beautiful wood flavors and mellowing effect, helps to balance the beer. We would typically see a 2.5–3% increase in ABV from the time the beer went into the barrel.

At home, you could use toasted or charred oak chips that have been soaked in good bourbon. If you are not barrel aging or conditioning the beer on wood chips, consider dry hopping the beer. You can get creative here. Staying classic would mean utilizing English or classic continental European hops. Crossing style lines allows for new flavor-forward hops. Make sure to rub and smell the hops before dry hopping with them to ensure the quality is good. 14–20 grams per gallon will provide assertive hop character, 5–7 grams per gallon will give balanced hop notes. Look for Experimental hop HBC 472 for an extra special Barleywine dry hopping experience." – Matt Brynildson, Brewmaster

Flanders Brown Ale
Flanders Brown Ale (Oud Bruin)
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.049 FG = 1.012
IBU = 20 SRM = 16.4 ABV = 4.7%

Note that the total grain bill of 10.33 lbs. (4.7 kg) is based on a brew system with a nominal extract efficiency of approximately 65%. If your setup is better or worse, adjust the grain quantities accordingly. Original gravities (OG) may vary depending on your brand selection for grain and on your evaporation losses during the boil. Always use your hydrometer to verify the OG at the end of the boil and liquor your wort down to the target OG if necessary.

Ingredients
5.0 lbs. (2.3 kg) pale Pils malt (1.5–2 °L)
1.26 lbs. (0.57 kg) 6-row pale brewers malt (1.7–2 °L)
1.89 lbs. (0.86 kg) Vienna malt (3–4 °L)
2.14 lbs. (0.97 kg) crystal malt (40 °L)
5.5 AAU German Hallertauer Mittelfrüh (1.4 oz./ 39 g of 4% alpha acid)
1 oz. (28 g) Saaz for aroma
2 cups French oak chips (medium-toast)
2 packages Wyeast 1388 (Belgian Strong Ale) or White Labs WLP550 (Belgian Ale) yeast
1 package Wyeast 5335 (Lactobacillus bruchneri) bacteria
3/4 cup dry malt extract (for priming)

Step by Step
Mash in at approximately 125 °F (52 °C) for a 20-minute rest hydration, beta-glucan and protein rest. Using a combination of hot-water infusion and direct heat, raise the temperature to 144 °F (62 °C) for a 40-minute beta-amylase rest. Raise the temperature again to 162 °F (72 °C) for a 40-minute alpha-amylase rest. Recirculate the run-off for 15–20 minutes, until it runs clear; then start lautering and sparging, until the wort in the kettle reaches a gravity of approximately 1.48 (12°P).Boil the wort for about 90 minutes. Add the bittering hops 15 minutes into the boil and the aroma hops 75 minutes into the boil. After shutdown, the wort should have evaporated sufficiently to be at or above the target original gravity. If not, liquor down to adjust. Stir the wort gently with a spatula to create a whirlpool effect. Then let the brew rest for at least 30 minutes (longer is better) to allow for sedimentation of the hot break and hop debris. Siphon the wort off the trub and heat exchange it to the primary fermentation temperature of about 68 °F (20 °C), add 1 cup of French oak chips (medium-toast) and pitch one package of yeast as well as the package of bacteria. Because the bacteria have a longer lag time, the yeast will start primary fermentation and metabolize most of the sugars before the bacteria become active. Rack after two weeks, then again after four weeks, and add the second cup of French oak chips.Pitch the second package of yeast and the priming agent into the still, racked brew and package immediately. Condition the finished beer in bottles or in a keg for another six weeks. The beer improves with longer conditioning and will keep for at least six months if stored in a cool and dark environment.

Flanders Brown Ale (Oud Bruin)
(5 gallons/19 L, partial mash)
OG = 1.049 FG = 1.012
IBU = 20 SRM = 16.4 ABV = 4.8%

Note that the grain-to-extract equivalent of 7 lbs. (3.2 kg) liquid malt extract (LME) is based on a nominal LME solid content of approximately 80% and on a theoretical zero-contribution to gravity of the steeped grain. Original gravities (OG) may vary depending on your LME brand selection. Also, for convenience you may wish to use just an entire 6.6-lb. (3-kg) can of LME and accept a slightly smaller volume of wort. Always use your hydrometer to verify the OG at the end of the boil.

Ingredients
3.85 lbs. (1.75 kg) pale Pils liquid malt extract
1.26 lb. (0.57 kg) 6-row pale brewers malt (approx. 1.7–2 °L)
1.89 lbs. (0.9 kg) Vienna malt (3–4 °L)
2.14 lbs. (0.97 kg) crystal malt (40 °L)
5.5 AAU German Hallertauer Mittelfrüh for buttering (approximately 1.4 oz./39 g of 4% alpha acid)
1 oz. (28 g) Saaz for aroma
2 cups French oak chips (medium-toast)
2 packages Wyeast 1388 (Belgian Strong Ale ) yeast or White Labs WLP550 (Belgian Ale) yeast
1 package Wyeast 5335 (Lactobacillus bruchneri) bacteria
3/4 cup dry malt extract (for priming)

Step by Step
Replace the pale Pils malt from the all-grain recipe with the Pils LME. Place each of the milled specialty grains in a separate muslin bag. Steep them for about an hour in about 2 gallons (0.9 L) of approximately 190 °F (88 °C) water. Lift the bags and rinse with cold water, but without squeezing them. Heat the flavored and colored brewing liquor to the boiling point. Turn off the heat. Stir in the LME and fill the kettle to about five gallons (19 L). Bring it to a boil again. From here on, follow the equivalent instructions from the all-grain recipe.

1 French heavy toast oak stave soaked in red wine
Imperial Yeast G02 (Kaiser) or White Labs WLP036 (Düsseldorf Alt Ale) or SafAle K-97 yeast
Imperial Yeast F08 (Sour Batch Kidz) or White Labs WLP665 (Flemish Ale) blend
3⁄4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
This is a single infusion mash. Heat 3.75 gallons (14.2 L) of strike water to 169 °F (76 °C). Mash at 155 °F (68 °C) to 60 minutes before beginning mashout process. Collect 6.5 gallons (24.6 L) of wort and bring to a boil. Boil for 60 minutes, adding hops and candi syrup as indicated.

Chill wort, aerate, and pitch the German ale yeast (don’t pitch the blend at this time). Ferment at 62 °F (17 °C) for about 10–14 days.

When final gravity is reached and beer has settled, transfer to secondary and inoculate with the yeast/bacteria blend. Give the bugs several weeks to get their funk on before dumping the wine and adding the stave to your beer. Within as little as a few months the beer will be ready to keg or bottle!

Flanders Red Ale
(5 gallons/19 L, partial mash)
OG = 1.061FG = ~1.008
IBU =5SRM = 22ABV = ~7%

Ingredients

Replace the Pilsner, Vienna, Red X®, and Munich malts in the all-grain version with 1.5 lbs. (0.68 kg) Pilsen dried malt extract, 1.5 lbs. (0.68 kg) Vienna dried malt extract, 1 lb. (0.45 kg) Munich dried malt extract, and 2 lbs. (0.9 kg) Best Malz Red X® malt. The rest of the ingredients are the same as the all-grain recipe.

Step by Step

Starting with 1.5 gallons (6 L) of water, bring temperature to 160 °F (71 °C). In a large grain bag, submerge the crushed Red X®, aromatic, and red wheat malts into the water. Hold the mash temperature at 155 °F (68 °C)for 45 minutes, then stir in the remaining crushed grains while bringing the temperature back to 155 °F (68 °C). Hold this temperature for at least 15 minutes, then wash all the grains with 1.5 gallons (5.7 L) of hot water.

Top off the kettle to 6.5 gallons (24.6 L) and stir in malt extracts while off heat until fully dissolved. Return to heat and bring wort to a boil for 60 minutes, adding hops and candi syrup according to the ingredients list. Follow the remainder of the all-grain recipe.

Tips for Success:
If you haven’t saved an oak stave from a batch of wine you made, don’t fret, but you may have to start soaking it 2–3 months prior to brew day to achieve the right balance and that freshly dumped barrel taste. Place your stave in a Ziplock or vacuum seal bag and pour in about 8 oz. (235 mL) of your favorite full-bodied and tannic red wine (like a Cabernet Sauvignon). Moving it in and out of the freezer daily will help speed up the rate of extraction.

Flanders Red Recipe
Flanders Red
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.057 FG = 1.008
IBU = 16 SRM = 15 ABV = 6.5%

Ingredients
5.3 lbs. (2.4 kg) Vienna malt (4 °L)
5.3 lbs. (2.4 kg) continental Pilsner malt (2 °L)
8.5 oz. (0.24 kg) aromatic malt (20 °L)
8.5 oz. (0.24 kg) caramel Munich (60 °L)
8.5 oz. (0.24 kg) caramel Munich (120 °L)
3.5 AAU Kent Goldings hops (60 min.) (0.7 oz./20 g at 5% alpha acid)
Irish moss (15 min.)
1 oz. (28 g) medium toast French oak cubes (added in secondary)
Wyeast 3763 (Roeselare Blend) or White Labs WLP655 (Belgian Sour Mix I) yeast

Step by Step
I currently use Best Malz Pilsen and Vienna, but feel free to substitute any high quality malt of the same type and color from a different supplier. The Aromatic® malt is from Briess and the two types of caramel Munich are from Franco-Belges. My hops are in pellet form and come from Hop Union, Willamette Valley, or Hopsteiner depending on the variety.

Mill the grains and dough-in targeting a mash of around 1.5 quarts of water to 1 pound of grain (a liquor-to-grist ratio of about 3:1 by weight) and a temperature of 154 °F (68 °C). Hold the mash at 154 °F (68 °C) until enzymatic conversion is complete. Infuse the mash with near boiling water while stirring or with a recirculating mash system raise the temperature to mash out at 168 °F (76 °C). Sparge slowly with 170 °F (77 °C) water, collecting wort until the pre-boil kettle volume is around 6.5 gallons (25 L) and the gravity is 1.044.

The total wort boil time is 90 minutes, which helps reduce the S-Methyl Methionine (SMM) present in the lightly kilned Pilsner malt and results in less Dimethyl Sulfide (DMS) in the finished beer. Add the hops with 60 minutes remaining in the boil. Add Irish moss or other kettle finings with 15 minutes left in the boil if you please. Chill the wort to 68 °F (20 °C) and aerate thoroughly. For this beer, I like a pitch rate of two packages of the liquid yeast blends. I'm not sure what that pitch rate is, given the mixed nature of these cultures, but I like the results.

Ferment around 68 °F (20 °C) until the yeast drops to the bottom and forms a layer. With healthy yeast, this should be complete in two weeks or less, but there is no need to rush it. Rack the beer to a smaller secondary container, add the oak cubes, and close with a very slightly permeable closure, such as a carboy cap. Place in a spot protected from light and check every couple of months to see how your baby is coming along. It can easily take a year or more to fully develop. Be patient. When the beer has developed the character you desire, you can rack to a keg and force carbonate or you can add priming sugar and a fresh dose of yeast to carbonate in the bottle. Be careful, if you bottle too early, there could still be significant sugars present for the Brettanomyces to continue to consume. Once the beers are carbonated, store in the refrigerator to prevent bottle bombs. Target a carbonation level of 2 to 2.5 volumes.

Flanders Red
(5 gallons/19 L, extract with grains)
OG = 1.057 FG = 1.008
IBU = 16 SRM = 17 ABV = 6.5%

Ingredients
7.2 lbs. (3.25 kg) Munich liquid malt
8.5 oz. (0.24 kg) aromatic malt (20 °L)
8.5 oz. (0.24 kg) caramel Munich (60 °L)
8.5 oz. (0.24 kg) caramel Munich (120 °L)
3.5 AAU Kent Goldings hops (60 min.) (0.7 oz./20 g at 5% alpha acid)
Irish moss (15 min.)
1 oz. (28 g) medium toast French oak cubes (added in secondary)
Wyeast 3763 (Roeselare Blend) or White Labs WLP655 (Belgian Sour Mix I) yeast

Step by Step
There are many Munich extract blends out there. It is always better to choose the freshest extract available. If you cannot get fresh liquid malt extract, see if you can find a dry Munich extract instead. The Aromatic® malt is from Briess and the two types of caramel Munich are from Franco-Belges. My hops are in pellet form and come from Hop Union, Willamette Valley, or Hopsteiner depending on the variety.

Mill or coarsely crack the specialty malt and place loosely in a grain bag. Steep the bag in about 1 gallon (~4 L) of water at roughly 170 °F (77 °C) for about 30 minutes. Lift the grain bag out of the steeping liquid and rinse with warm water. Allow the bag to drip into the kettle. Do not squeeze the bag. Add the malt extract and enough water to make a pre-boil volume of 5.9 gallons (22.3 liters) and a gravity of 1.048. Stir thoroughly to help dissolve the extract and bring to a boil.

Once the wort is boiling, add the hops. The total wort boil time is 1 hour after adding the hops. Add Irish moss or other kettle finings with 15 minutes left in the boil if you please. Chill the wort to 68 °F (20 °C) and aerate thoroughly. Follow the fermentation and packaging instructions for the all-grain version.

Step by Step
Mash the Pilsner, Munich, and aromatic malts at 148–152 °F (64–67 °C) for 60 minutes. Add the Carafa II® and roasted barley to the mash just before sparging. (A decoction mash could and should be used if your system allows.) Sparge as normal, and bring the wort to a boil. Boil for 90 minutes, adding the hops at the times indicated in the ingredients list. When the boil is complete, chill the wort down to pitching temperature, transfer to a fermenter, and pitch the yeast. Start the fermentation at 70 °F (21 °C) and once initial fermentation starts, lower the temperature to the low 50’s °F (~11 °C). Ferment to final gravity at 52–54 °F (11–12 °C). Lager at 32–34 °F (0–2 °C) for 4–8 weeks. Then bottle or keg as usual.

Extract with grains option:
Reduce amount of Pilsner malt to 3 oz. (85 g). Add 2 lbs. (0.91 kg) of light dried malt extract and 4.25 lbs. (1.9 kg) light liquid malt (late addition). Steep the specialty grains at around 152 °F (67 °C in 2 gallon (3.8 L) of water in a large kitchen pot. Put the crushed grains in a large steeping bag and submerge bag in the kitchen pot for 30–45 minutes. At the end of the steep, remove the bag from the steeping pot and let drip dry for a minute or so. Add the "grain tea" to your brew pot and add the light liquid malt extract. Boil for 60 minutes, adding the hops at the times indicated in the ingredients list. With 15 minutes left in the boil, stir in the liquid malt extract. After the boil, cool the wort, top up with enough cool water to make 5 gallons (19 L), aerate, and pitch yeast. Follow the remainder of the all-grain recipe.

IBU = 13 SRM = 4 ABV = 4.5%

Numero Uno is Flying Dog’s summer seasonal release. Flaked maize makes up one-third of the malt bill and highlights the distinctive corn and cracker flavor traditionally found in Mexican lagers.

Ingredients
6 lbs. (2.7 kg) 2-row pale malt
3 lbs. (1.4 kg) flaked maize
4 oz. (113 g) Munich malt (10 °L)
1 oz. (30 mL) agave nectar (15 min.)
7 g lime peel (secondary)
2.5 AAU Amarillo® hops (60 min.) (0.25 oz./7 g at 10% alpha acids)
4 AAU Saaz hops (5 min.) (1 oz./28 g at 4% alpha acids)
White Labs WLP940 (Mexican Lager) or Wyeast 2002 (Gambrinus Lager) yeast
2⁄3 cup (133 g) dextrose (if priming)

Step by step
Mill the grains and mix with 3 gallons (11.4 L) of 163 °F (73 °C) strike water to reach a mash temperature of 151 °F (66 °C). Hold this temperature for 60 minutes. Vorlauf until your runnings are clear. Sparge the grains with 5.5 gallons (20.8 L) and top up as necessary to obtain 6 gallons (23 L) of wort. Boil for 60 minutes, adding hops and agave nectar according to the ingredient list. Chill the wort 54 °F (12 °C), aerate, and pitch yeast. Ferment at 54 °F (12 °C) until gravity reaches 1.024, then let the temperature rise to 60 °F (16 °C) until fermentation completes for a diacetyl rest. Add lime peel and age to taste (5–7 days). Crash the beer to 35 °F (2 °C) for 48 hours, and bottle or keg the beer and carbonate to approximately 2.25 volumes. After carbonation, lager at near-freezing temperatures for at least six weeks before serving.

Partial mash option:
Reduce the 2-row pale malt in the all-grain recipe to 1 lb. (0.45 kg) and the flaked maize to 1.25 lbs. (0.57 kg), and add 3.3 lbs. (1.5 kg) pale liquid malt extract. Bring 1 gallon (4 L) of water to approximately 163 °F (73 °C). Place the crushed malt and flaked maize in a muslin bag and submerge in the water. Temperature should stabilize at 151 °F (66 °C) then hold there for about 60 minutes. Remove the grain bag and place in a colander. Wash the grains with 1 gallon (4 L) of hot water. Add the liquid extract while stirring, and stir until completely dissolved. Top up to 6 gallons (23 L) and bring the wort to a boil for 60 minutes.

Tips for Success:
There are some minor diacetyl concerns with this yeast, so be sure to increase your temperatures once the gravity reaches 1.024. As for the contact time/weight on the lime peel, a lot will depend on your limes and process, so continue to taste throughout the post-fermentation period, and when it’s to your liking, package it up.

Heat 5.5 quarts (5.2 L) of water to 166 °F (74 °C) and pour into 2-gallon (7.6-L) beverage cooler. Place crushed specialty grains in a nylon steeping bag and submerge. Stir grains well, tie off bag lightly and seal cooler. Let grains steep, starting at 155 °F (68 °C), for 30 minutes. While grains are steeping, heat 2 gallons (7.6 L) of water to a boil in your brewpot and 2.5 qts. (2.4 L) of water to 180 °F (82 °C) in a large kitchen pot. Run off "grain tea" and add to boiling water in brewpot. Add the 2.5 qts. (2.4 L) of 180 °F (82 °C) water to the cooler, untie bag, stir grains and let sit for 5 minutes. Run off remaining "grain tea" and add to brewpot. Add dried malt extract and bring to a boil. Add first charge of hops and boil for 60 minutes, adding other hops at times indicated in the ingredient list. With 15 minutes left in boil, stir in half of the liquid malt extract; add the remaining half at the end of the boil. Let wort sit 15 minutes before cooling. Cool wort and transfer to fermenter. Add water to make 5 gallons (19 L). Follow the remaining portion of the all-grain recipe.

This is a single infusion mash. On brew day, substitute in 8.7 lbs. (3.9 kg) of 2 row malt in place of the extracts. Mash grains at 152 ºF (67 ºC) for 60 mins. Collect enough wort to boil for 90 mins. and have a 5.5-gallon (20.9-L) yield (about 7 gallons or 26 L). Lower the Styrian Golding hops in the 30-min. boil to 0.5 oz. (14 g) to account for higher extraction ratio of a full boil. The rest of the recipe is the same as above.

Winner of Because Beer Homebrew Competition (Hamilton, Ontario: 500 entries)

Ingredients
17 lbs. (7.7 kg) pale ale malt
1 lb. (454 g) Briess Special Roast malt (40 °L)
1 lb. (454 g) carastan malt (35 °L)
4 oz. (113 g) crystal malt (40 °L)
6 oz. (170 g) crystal malt (80 °L)
9 oz. (255 g) crystal malt (120 °L)
1 lb. (454 g) brown sugar (30 min.)
25 AAU Magnum hops (60 min.) (1.5 oz./43 g at 16.7% alpha acid)
2.8 AAU UK Golding hops (20 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 5.6% alpha acid)
0.5 oz. (14 g) UK Golding hops (0 min.)
Wyeast 1028 (London Ale) or White Labs WLP013 (London Ale) or Lallemand Windsor yeast
3⁄4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Two or three days before brew day, make at least a 2-qt. (2-L) yeast starter, aerating the wort thoroughly (preferably with oxygen) before pitching the yeast. If opting for the dry yeast option, be sure to pitch 2 sachets.

On brew day, mash in the malts at 150 °F (66 °C) in 40 qts. (38 L) of water, and hold this temperature for 60 minutes. Sparge slowly with 170 °F (77 °C) water until 8.2 gallons (31 L) of wort is collected. Reserve the final 1 gallon (4 L) of wort collected. Boil this wort separately to reduce to 1 quart (1 L), then add to the main volume of wort.

Boil the full volume of wort for 180 minutes (that’s right, three hours), adding the hops at times indicated in the ingredients list. Add the brown sugar in the last 30 minutes. Chill to 64 °F (18 °C). Oxygenate, then pitch the yeast starter. Ferment at 66 °F (19 °C) for one week, then raise to 70 °F (21 °C) until fermentation is complete. Prime and bottle condition, or keg and force carbonate.

Step by Step
Two or three days before brew day, make at least a 2-qt. (2-L) yeast starter, aerating the wort thoroughly (preferably with oxygen) before pitching the yeast. If opting for the dry yeast option, be sure to pitch 2 sachets.

Use 8 gallons (30 L) of water in the brew kettle; heat to 158 °F (70 °C). Place the malts in a mesh bag, and steep in the hot water for 30 minutes. Remove the mesh bag, then turn the heat off. Add the liquid malt extract and stir thoroughly to dissolve the extract completely. You do not want to feel liquid extract at the bottom of the kettle when stirring with your spoon. Turn the heat back on and bring to a boil. Boil the wort for 180 minutes, adding the hops at the times indicated in the ingredients list. Add the brown sugar in the last 30 minutes.

Chill to 64 °F (18 °C). Oxygenate, then pitch the yeast starter. Ferment at 66 °F (19 °C) for one week, then raise to 70 °F (21 °C) until fermentation is complete. Prime and bottle condition, or keg and force carbonate.

Tips for Success:
A high-gravity beer like this absolutely needs enough healthy yeast cells for the fermentation to be successful. Jeremy has been refining this recipe since 2013 and he recommends using at least two smack packs of yeast if not making a starter (although a starter is highly recommended). For more on making a yeast starter, check out byo.com/resources/build-a-yeast-starter.

His recipe creates a dark and sweet English barleywine that tastes best after at least 10 months of aging — that was the age of the beer that won BOS. For more about aging your homebrew, check out byo.com/story150.

Tips for Success:

Forgotten Boardwalk Brewing Company, located in Cherry Hill, New Jersey, describes their Funnel Cake sweet cream ale smelling like "old-fashioned Nilla wafer" and tasting like classic Jersey Shore boardwalk funnel cake. The light Munich, flaked oats, and flaked maize create a rich pastry background, while the lactose and vanilla (a light touch of each) provide just enough sweetness. If you find your version is a bit cloying, just bump up the bittering hop addition by a few AAUs.

Ingredients
3.3 lbs. (1.5 kg) Muntons extra light, unhopped, liquid malt extract
2.5 lbs. (1.13 kg) Muntons extra light, dried malt extract
2.75 lbs. (1.24 kg) Pilsner malt
1⁄2 tsp. yeast nutrient (15 min.)
1⁄2 tsp. Irish moss (30 min.)
5.0 oz. (142 g) spruce tips (60 min.)
5.0 oz. (142 g) spruce tips (0 min.)
3.0 oz. (85 g) spruce tips (dry hop)
White Labs WLP041 (Pacific Ale) or Wyeast 1332 (Northwest Ale) yeast
0.75 cup (150 g) corn sugar (for priming)

Step by Step
Steep the crushed grain in 2 gallons (7.6 L) of water at 150 ºF (65.5 ºC) for 30 minutes. Remove grains from the wort and rinse with 2 quarts (1.8 L) of hot water. Add the liquid and dried malt extracts and bring to a boil. While boiling, add the spruce tips, Irish moss and yeast nutrient as per the schedule. During the boil, use this time to thoroughly sanitize a fermenter. Now add the wort to 2 gallons (7.6 L) of cold water in the sanitized fermenter and top off with cold water up to 5 gallons (19 L).

Cool the wort to 75 ºF (24 ºC). Pitch your yeast and aerate the wort heavily. Allow the beer to cool to 68 ºF (20 ºC). Hold at that temperature until fermentation is complete. Transfer to a carboy and add the "dry hopped" spruce tips. Avoid any splashing to prevent aerating the beer. Allow the beer to condition for one week, strain out the spruce tips and then bottle or keg. Allow the beer to carbonate and age for two weeks and enjoy your Spruce Budd Ale.

All-grain option:
This is a single step infusion mash using a total of 12 lbs. (5.4 kg) Pilsner malt. Mix the crushed grains with 3.75 gallons (14.2 L) of 168 °F (75.5 °C) water to stabilize at 150 ºF (65.5 ºC) for 60 minutes. Sparge slowly with 175 ºF (79 ºC) water. Collect approximately 6 gallons (23 L) of wort runoff to boil for 60 minutes. The remainder of this recipe and procedures are the same as the extract with grain recipe.

Ingredients
8.4 lbs. (3.8 kg) 2-row pale malt
0.25 lb. (113 g) crystal malt (40 °L)
0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) flaked oats
2.8 AAU Mosaic™ hop pellets (60 min.) (0.25 oz./7 g at 11% alpha acids)
8.3 AAU Mosaic™ hop pellets (15 min.) (0.75 oz./21 g at 11% alpha acids)

2 oz. (57 g) Mosaic™ hop pellets (0 min.)
2.5 oz. (71 g) Mosaic™ hop pellets (dry hop)
0.25 oz. (7 g) Citra® hop pellets (dry hop)
1⁄2 tsp. Irish moss (30 min.)
Wyeast 1968 (London ESB), White Labs WLP002 (English Ale), or Lallemand Windsor Ale yeast
2⁄3 cup (133 g) dextrose (if priming)

Step by Step
This is a single step infusion mash, mashing at 154 to 156 °F (68 to 69 °C) to create a fuller-bodied beer. Mix all the crushed grains with 3.5 gallons (13 L) of 170 °F (77 °C) water and stabilize the mash at 156 °F (68 °C) for 60 minutes. Raise your mash temperature to 165 °F (74 °C) and sparge with enough 175 °F (79 °C) water to collect approximately 6 gallons (23 L) of wort. Boil wort for 60 minutes. Add hops and Irish moss as indicated. At the end of the boil, add 0-minute hop addition and immediately begin cooling your wort. You would like to have these hops in the wort with the temperature between boiling and around 150 °F (66 °C) for close to five minutes. When you have cooled the wort to about 80 °F (27 °C), you can strain the wort into a fermenter. Aerate the wort and pitch the yeast. Ferment at 70 °F (21 °C). When fermentation is complete, rack the beer off the trub and add the dry hops. Allow the beer to absorb the dry hop flavors for about four days. Bottle or keg as normal.

Extract with grains option:
Substitute the 2-row pale malt in the all-grain recipe with 3.3 lbs. (1.5 kg) Briess Pilsen liquid malt extract and 2 lbs. (0.9 kg) Briess light dried malt extract. Steep the crushed grains in 2.5 gallons (9.5 L) of water at 155 °F (68 °C) for 30 minutes. Remove the grains from the wort and rinse with hot water, bringing the brew pot volume up to 5.5 gallons (21 L). Add the malt extracts and boil for 60 minutes. Follow the remaining portion of the all-grain recipe.

Tips for Success:
Flaked grains such as flaked oats (as used in this recipe) or flaked wheat can provide extra mouthfeel, which can help balance a beer with higher hops and lower alcohol. Flaked grains technically should be mashed, or partial mashed to convert the starch. In the extract with grains version of this recipe, the grains are steeped at 155 °F (68 °C). This will not convert the starch in the grains, but it will still increase the mouthfeel (but may also leave some haze behind.)

(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.076  FG = 1.020
IBU = 71  SRM = 35  ABV = 7.6%

This is a black IPA that is enhanced with some rye malt. It pours a very dark brownish-black color with a nice billowing light tan head. Big tropical fruit and citrus rind aromas mix with sweet brown sugar and subtle rye notes. Lots of silky body creates great mouthfeel that showcases the rye and roasted malts. The silky body of this beer also delivers loads of tropical hop flavor with slight pine resin to the middle of your tongue. It finishes very balanced with a soft bitterness that goes well with the dark malt framework.

Ingredients
12 lbs. (5.4 kg) 2-row pale malt
2 lbs. (0.9 kg) rye malt
1.5 lbs. (0.7 kg) flaked rye
1 lb. (0.45 kg) wheat malt
1 lb. (0.45 kg) Munich malt (10 °L)
1 lb. (0.45 kg) black malt
14 AAU Columbus leaf hops (60 min.) (1 oz./28 g at 14% alpha acids)
8.5 AAU Amarillo® leaf hops (30 min.) (1 oz./28 g at 8.5% alpha acids)
14 AAU Columbus leaf hops (5 min.) (1 oz./28 g at 14% alpha acids)
4.25 AAU Amarillo® leaf hops (0 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 8.5% alpha acids)
1 oz. (28 g) Centennial pellet hops (dry hop)
White Labs WLP051 (California Ale V) or Wyeast 1272 (American Ale II) yeast
3⁄4 cup (150 g) dextrose (if priming)

Step by Step
This is a single step infusion mash. Mix the crushed grains with 5.8 gallons (22 L) of water at 161 °F (72 °C), stabilizing at 150 °F (66 °C) for 60 minutes. Raise the temperature of the mash to 168 °F (76 °C) with approximately 3.7 gallons (14 L) of 200 °F (93 °C) water, and then collect 7 gallons (26.5 L) of wort to begin your 60-minute boil. Add hops as indicated. At the end of the boil yYou should have about 5.5 gallons (21 L) wort in your kettle. Chill your wort, and pitch your yeast when the temperature of the wort is less than 75 °F (24 °C), and allow it to cool to 68 °F (20 °C) for fermenting. Since this is a relatively high gravity beer, make a yeast starter or use multiple packages of beer yeast. Dry hop with 1 oz. (28 g) of Centennial pellets after about 4 days of fermentation. When fermentation is complete, wait about 3 more days for a diacetyl rest, and then bottle or keg your beer.

Partial mash option:
Reduce the 2-row pale malt in the all-grain recipe to 1 lb. (0.45 kg) and add 6.6 lbs. (3.0 kg) pale liquid malt extract and 0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) light dried malt extract. Mash the crushed grains in 3 gallons (11.3 L) of 150–160 °F (66–71 °C) water for 30 minutes, stirring the grain just prior to removing. Remove the grain from the hot water with a strainer, then wash the grains with 1 gallon (4 L) hot water. Bring wort to a boil and add dried malt extract, stirring to dissolve. Boil for 60 minutes, adding hops at times indicated. At the end of the boil turn off the heat and add the liquid malt extract, stirring until all malt is dissolved. Strain the hot wort into a fermenter filled with approximately 2.5 gallons (9.5 L) of cold water and top off to 5.5 gallons (21 L) mark. Follow the remaining portion of the all-grain recipe.

Foundation Head Brewer and Co-Owner Joel Mahaffey says, "The characteristics that I feel are the hallmarks of a Maine IPA are a soft body, modest but solid malt backbone, low bitterness (but sufficient to avoid cloying sweetness), and a dominating hop flavor and aroma profile. Characteristics should lean towards fruit, be it citrus or tropical, but notes of pine and resin are also perfectly acceptable."

Step by Step
This recipe is designed for homebrewers to achieve 5.5 gal­lons (21 L) wort in their fermenter on brew day. This will help offset the loss of volume to the heavy hopping rate of this beer. Build your water profile to achieve a 100:100 PPM sulfate: chloride profile. Crush the malt and add to 5 gallons (19 L) strike water to achieve a stable mash temperature at 154 °F (68 °C). After 60 minutes, begin to lauter. Collect approximately 7 gallons (26.5 L) of wort in the kettle. Boil for 60 minutes, adding the first hop addition and corn sugar with 10 minutes left in the boil. After the boil, remove from heat then add the second hop addition. Stir the wort, then let settle for 30 min­utes before cooling to yeast pitching temperature. Ferment at 68 °F (20 °C). As the kräusen begins to fall, typically day 4 or 5, add the dry hops and let the beer sit on the hops for 3 days. Bottle with priming sugar or keg and force carbonate to 2.4 volumes CO2.

Partial mash option:
Substitute the Pilsner and 2-row malts in the all-grain recipe with 4 lbs. (1.8 kg) Pilsen dried malt extract and 3.3 lbs. (1.5 kg) light liquid malt extract, and increase the corn sugar addition to 1.3 lbs. (0.6 kg). Place the crushed malt in a large muslin bag. Soak the grains in 1.5 gallons (6 L) water at 154 °F (68 °C) for 60 minutes. Remove the grain bag and wash with 2 qts. (2 L) hot water. Top off the kettle to 6 gallons (23 L) and heat up to boil. As soon as the water begins to boil, remove from heat and stir in the dried and liquid malt extracts. Stir until all the extract is dissolved then return the wort to a boil. Follow the remaining portion of the all-grain recipe.

The Alchemist: Moose Knuckle clone
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.054  FG = 1.013
IBU = 60  SRM = 5  ABV = 5.5%

This is an American pale ale recipe pulled from the old files of The Alchemist Pub & Brewery, prior to the devastating 2011 flood from Hurricane Irene that badly damaged the original brewpub property in Waterbury, Vermont and forced the closure of that location.

Ingredients
11 lbs. (4.3 kg) Thomas Fawcett Maris Otter malt
3.5 AAU Warrior® hops (60 min.) (0.25 oz./7 g at 14% alpha acids)
4.75 AAU Centennial hops (5 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 9.5% alpha acids)
3.5 AAU Cascade hops (5 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 7% alpha acids)
1 oz. (28 g) Centennial hops (0 min.)
1 oz. (28 g) Cascade hops (0 min.)
1.5 oz. (43 g) Centennial hops (dry hop)
1.5 oz. (43 g) Cascade hops (dry hop)
The Yeast Bay (Vermont Ale) or GigaYeast GY054 (Vermont IPA) or East Coast Yeast ECY29 (North East Ale) or Omega Yeast Labs (DIPA Ale) yeast
3⁄4 cups (150 g) dextrose (if priming)

Step by Step
Crush the malt and add it to 4 gallons (15 L) of strike water to achieve a stable mash temperature at 160 °F (71 °C). Raise the temperature to mash out and begin to lauter. Boil for 60 minutes, adding hops as indicated. After you turn off the heat, stir the wort to create a whirlpool, and let it settle for 30 minutes with the lid on. After 30 minutes, chill the wort rapidly to 68 °F (20 °C) and pitch the yeast. Ferment at 68 °F (20 °C). After fermentation is complete, add the dry hops and let the beer sit on the hops for 3-4 days. Bottle with priming sugar or keg and force carbonate to 2.4 volumes CO2.

Extract with grains option:
Substitute the Maris Otter malt in the all-grain recipe with 7.5 lbs. (3.4 kg) Maris Otter liquid malt extract. Heat 5 gallons (19 L) of soft water up to boil. As soon as the water begins to boil, remove the brewpot from the heat and stir in the liquid malt extract. Stir until all of the extract is dissolved then return the wort to a boil. Boil for 60 minutes. Follow the remaining portion of the all-grain recipe.

Tips for Success:
Floor malted Maris Otter grains will help lay a solid malt back bone. But don’t be afraid to mash on the hotter end of the spectrum to maximize the alpha amylase enzymes, which can help build the body of the beer. The Cascade and Centennial hops add nice grapefruit and orange qualities that pair nicely with the slight fruitiness that the Alchemist’s yeast strain adds. As always with hop-forward beers, pay special attention to oxygen uptake post fermentation as the hop aroma can quickly degrade if you are not careful.

The Alchemist’s beers are brewed with very soft water. If you get a water report and find that your water has a solid mineral base you might consider diluting your mash or boil water with a distilled water (or at least use something bottled that’s softer than yours!). You may also want to add 1–2 tsp. sulfates if using reverse osmosis or soft water low in permanent hardness. Also, John Kimmich is a very technique-oriented brewer with all of his beers, so don’t be afraid to experiment with your dry hopping to try and find the best flavor profile. Bagging your hops in a muslin brewing bag commonly used for steeping grains can make them easier to retrieve when you are ready to remove them from the beer. If you bag your dry hops, however, keep in mind that it can reduce the hops exposure to the beer and possibly disturb the blanket of CO2. Remedy this by making sure you don’t pack the bag of hops too tightly.

Fourpure Brewery's Juicebox Citrus IPA clone
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.058 FG = 1.013
IBU = 61 SRM = 6 ABV = 5.9%

Juicebox is a citrus IPA packed full of orange zest and aromatic hops and is packaged by Fourpure in kegs and cans. As the essential oils are held in suspension, it’s best drunk fresh!

Ingredients
10 lbs. (4.5 kg) Maris Otter pale ale malt (2.4°L)
0.7 lb. (0.32 kg) torrified wheat
0.3 lb. (0.12 kg) caramalt (15 °L)
0.3 lb. (0.12 kg) table sugar (15 min.)
3.8 AAU Mandarina Bavaria hops (first wort hops) (0.4 oz./11 g at 9.5% alpha acids)
18 AAU Citra® hops (0 min.) (1.5 oz./43 g at 12% alpha acids)
16.5 AAU Falconer’s Flight® hops (0 min.) (1.5 oz./43 g at 11% alpha acids)
14.3 AAU Mandarina Bavaria hops (0 min.) (1.5 oz./43 g at 9.5% alpha acids)
4 oz. (113 g) Citra® hops (dry hop)
1 oz. (28 g) Falconer’s Flight® hops (dry hop)
1⁄2 Whirlfloc tablet (10 min)
1 oz. (28 g) fresh orange zest (0 min.)
White Labs WLP001 (California Ale) or Wyeast 1056 (American Ale) or Safale US-05 yeast
1⁄2 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Mill the grains and dough-in targeting a mash of around 1.3 quarts of strike water to 1 pound of grain (2.7 L/kg) and a temperature of 154 °F (68 °C). Hold the mash at 154 °F (68 °C) for 60 minutes. Sparge slowly with 171 °F (77 °C), collecting wort until the pre-boil kettle volume is 6.5 gallons (24.6 L). Add the first wort hops to the kettle during the sparging process.

Total boil time is 75 minutes, adding the hops at the times indicated. Add Whirlfloc with 10 minutes left in the boil. After flameout, add the final hop addition and fresh orange zest to the whirlpool. Let steep for 20 minutes before chilling.

Chill the wort to 66 °F (19 °C) and aerate thoroughly. Pitch the yeast and ferment at 66 °F (19 °C) until fermentation is complete. Dry hop for 3 to 4 days. Carbonate the beer to around 2.5 volumes of CO2 and allow time for the beer to condition fully.

Tips for Success:
John Driebergen, Head Brewer at Fourpure, experimented with a number of oranges before perfecting this recipe, eventually settling on a Brazilian variety. It’s worth trying different types to achieve the right balance of citrus and hops. The orange flavor should not totally overpower the bitterness of the hops, but rather balance and complement it.

Fourth Quarter Porter
Fourth Quarter Porter
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.044 FG = 1.009
IBU = 30 SRM = 24 ABV = 4.6%

A more highly-attenuated, less caramel-sweet version of a brown porter. A firm, but not overpowering, roast character takes center stage on this balanced, drinkable ale. A brown porter with the session beer sensibilities of a dark mild or dry stout. Invite a few buddies over — even the ones who "don’t like dark beers" — and this keg of porter will kick by the fourth quarter.

Ingredients
4.0 lbs. (1.8 kg) US 2-row pale malt
3.0 lbs. (1.4 kg) Munich malt (10 °L)
8.0 oz. (0.23 kg) crystal malt (40 °L)
6.0 oz. (0.17 kg) chocolate malt
2.0 oz. (57 g) black patent malt
1.0 oz. (28 g) roast barley (500 °L)
0.75 lb. (0.23 kg) cane sugar
8.0 AAU Willamette hops (60 mins) (1.6 oz./45 g of 5.0% alpha acids)
Wyeast 1056 (American Ale), White Labs WLP001 (California Ale) or Safale S-05 yeast (1.5 quart/~1.5 L yeast starter)
7/8 cup corn sugar (for priming)

Step by Step
Mash at 149 °F (65 °C) for 60 minutes in 10 qts. (9.5 L) of brewing liquor. Collect around 5 gallons (19 L) of wort — stop collecting wort if specific gravity of runnings drops below 1.010 — and add water to make 6.0 gallons (23 L). Boil for 60 minutes, adding hops at times indicated in the ingredient list. Add cane sugar for final 15 minutes of boil. Ferment at 68 °F (20 °C).

Partial mash option:
Omit pale malt. Add 3.0 lbs. (1.4 kg) of Coopers Light liquid malt extract to the ingredient list. Use a 2.0-gallon (7.6-L) beverage cooler as a mash tun for your partial mash. Mash at 149 °F (65 °C) for 60 minutes in 5.5 quarts (5.2 L) of brewing liquor. Collect first wort and add 180 °F (82 °C) water to cooler to restore previous liquid level. Collect second wort, add water to wort in kettle to make make 3.0 gallons (11 L). Bring wort to a boil. (No DME is added before the boil.) Boil wort for 60 minutes, adding hops at times indicated in the ingredient list. Add liquid malt extract and sugar with 15 minutes left in boil. Cool wort (perhaps by placing brew pot in cold water in sink), then transfer to fermenter. Top up with cool water to 5.0 gallons (19 L), aerate and pitch yeast. Ferment at 68 °F (20 °C).

2.75 AAU Pilgrim hops (5 min.) (0.25 oz./7 g at 11% alpha acids)
5 oz. (142 g) ground coffee
2 lbs. (0.9 kg) Baker’s shaved coconut (secondary)
1 lb. (0.45 kg) Ghana cacao nibs or 0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) unsweetened cocoa powder (secondary)
Wyeast 1968 (London ESB Ale) or White Labs WLP002 (English Ale) or Lallemand Windsor yeast
2⁄3 cup (133 g) dextrose (if priming)

Step by Step
Mill the grains and mix with 5.3 gallons (20 L) of 164 °F (73 °C) strike water to reach a mash temperature of 152 °F (67 °C). Hold this temperature for 60 minutes. Vorlauf until your runnings are clear. Sparge the grains with 3 gallons (11.3 L) water and top up as necessary to obtain 6 gallons (23 L) of wort. Boil for 90 minutes, adding hops according to the ingredient list. Chill the wort to 65 °F (18 °C), aerate, and pitch yeast. Ferment at 68 °F (20 °C) for 7 days, then drop the temperature to 60 °F (16 °C) for 24 hours. Add the cacao nibs and coconut, and age for 14 days. Crash the beer to 36 °F (2 °C) for 48 hours, adding the ground coffee after 12 hours, and bottle or keg the beer and carbonate to approximately 2.25 volumes.

Partial mash option:
Reduce the pale malt in the all-grain recipe to 3.5 lbs. (1.6 kg) and add 6.6 lbs. (3 kg) pale liquid malt extract. Mill the grains and place in one or more grain bags. Mix with 2.3 gallons (8.9 L) of 164 °F (73 °C) strike water to reach a mash temperature of 152 °F (67 °C). Hold this temperature for 60 minutes. Remove the grain bags, and place into a colander. Wash the grains with 2 gallons (7.6 L) hot water and let drain fully. Add liquid extract and stir until completely dissolved and top off to 6 gallons (23 L) of wort. Bring to a boil and boil for 90 minutes. Follow the remaining portion of the all-grain recipe.

Tips for Success:
Brewmaster John Stemler notes that the brewery, when adding the coconut and cacao to the beer, bags and autoclaves the ingredients – but due to standard food processing requirements it is highly likely that you can add them directly from unopened containers without fear of infection! For the coffee addition, he states, "We get fresh roasted Colombian and have it ground coarse like for a French press. Post fermentation we crash the beer to 36 °F (2 °C) in the fermenter and just drop the coffee in the top of the tank. It stays in contact for 36 hours, then gets strained to the bright. We dose at a rate of 1 lb. (0.45 kg) per barrel, so about 0.5 oz. (14 g) per gallon (4 L). I'd do 1 oz. (28 g) per gallon (4 L) for homebrew scale batches I think. The short contact is key to not getting the vegetable off flavors from coffee."

Bring the wort up to a boil, and add 1.0 lbs (0.45 kg) of the light dried malt extract. Now add the Warrior® hops, first addition of Cascade hops, Irish moss and boil for 60 minutes. Add the 6.6 pounds (3 kg) of liquid malt extract for the last 5 minutes of the boil and stir to thoroughly mix the wort and avoid scorching the malt extract to the bottom of your kettle. At the end of your 60-minute boil turn your heat off, and add the fresh Cascade hops. Stir the fresh hops into the beer for 5 minutes. Add the wort to about 2 gallons (7.5 L) of cold water in your sanitized fermenter, and top up to 5.25 (19.75 L) gallons. Cool the wort to 65 °F (18 °C) and add your yeast. Aerate your wort, and ferment at 68 °F (20 °C) until fermentation is complete.

All-Grain Option:
Replace the liquid and dried malt extracts with 11.5 lbs (5.2 kg) of 2-row pale malt. Mash at 155 °F (68 °C) for 60 minutes, then mash off at 168 °F (75 °C) for an additional 5 minutes and collect about 6.5 gallons (24.5 L) of wort. Boil for 30 minutes without any hop additions, then boil 60 minutes with the Warrior® and first addition of Cascade hops and Irish moss. Turn off your burner, and now steep the fresh Cascade hops for 5 minutes. Cool your wort, fill your fermenter and ferment at 68 °F (20 °C) until fermentation is complete. Bottle or keg as usual.

This collaboration black IPA shows off a big fruity, spicy, herbal hop profile.

Ingredients
12 lbs. (5.4 kg) Maris Otter pale ale malt
1 lb. (0.45 kg) light Munich malt
5.6 oz. (159 g) Carafa® Special III malt (525 °L)
4.6 oz. (130 g) Carahell® malt (9 °L)
0.34 oz. (10 mL) CO2 extracted hop extract (~100 IBUs)
1.9 oz. (55 g) Delta hops (0 min.)
1.9 oz. (55 g) Nelson Sauvin hops (0 min.)
1.9 oz. (55 g) Citra® hops (dry hop)
1.9 oz. (55 g) Galaxy hops (dry hop)
White Labs WLP090 (San Diego Super) yeast (2.75 qts./2.75 L yeast starter)
3⁄4 cup (150 g) dextrose (if priming)

Step by Step
You will need 4.25 gallons (16 L) of strike water. Infusion mash at 152 °F (67 °C) for 60 minutes, then raise temperature to 165 °F (74 °C) for mash off. Recirculate wort, then run off and sparge to yield about 6.5 gallons (25 L) of wort. Use sparge water hot enough to maintain grain bed temperature at around 170 °F (77 °C), but not over. Boil wort for 90 minutes, adding hops at times indicated. Chill wort and transfer to fermenter. Aerate well and pitch sediment from yeast starter. Ferment at 68 °F (20 °C). At end of fermentation, dry hop and hold warm for three days, then chill to 34 °F (1.1 °C) and age for a week. Bottle or keg as normal.

Extract with grains option:
Substitute the pale and Munich malts in the all-grain recipe with 2.25 lbs. (1 kg) light dried malt extract and 6 lbs. (2.7 kg) Maris Otter liquid malt extract. Place grains in a steeping bag and steep at 152 °F (67 °C) for 20 minutes in 2.7 qts. (2.6 L) of water. Begin heating at least 3 gallons (11 L) of water in your brewpot as the grains steep. Rinse grains with 1.5 qts. (1.4 L) of 170 °F (77 °C) water and add "grain tea" to water in brewpot. Stir in dried malt extract and bring wort to a boil. Boil for 60 minutes, adding hops at times indicated. Stir in liquid malt extract during the final 15 minutes of the boil. Follow the remaining portion of the all-grain recipe.

Tips for Success:
If you are unable to source the hop extract in this recipe, try substituting any neutral high-alpha hop that will get you to about 100 theoretical IBUs — for example, 1.6 oz. (45 g) of Summit™ hops, at 17.5% alpha acids (for 28 AAU total), boiled for 60 minutes. For this beer, adjust your water’s chemistry to an appropriate residual alkalinity (RA) for the color and the right amount of sulfates (and sulfate to chloride ratio) for a bitter or very bitter beer. When brewing this beer, gypsum is your friend.

Fugglemania Pale Ale
Fugglemania Pale Ale
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.050 FG = 1.012
IBU = 42 SRM = 13 ABV = 4.9%

I decided I wouldn’t make the all-grain and extract recipe hops identical, because I wanted to "showcase" the different varieties, and I chose Styrian Goldings for the extract version because this variety is really a Fuggle, so I could still call it Fugglemania! If you want, though, you can use the same Fuggle additions as those listed in the all-grain recipe (or use the Styrian Goldings in the all-grain recipe).

Ingredients
9 lbs. (4.1 kg) Maris Otter pale malt
1 lb. (454 g) Briess Munich malt (10 °L)
0.5 lb. (227 g) Briess caramel malt (40 °L)
8 AAU UK Fuggle hop pellets (90 min.) (2 oz./57 g at 4% alpha acids)
8 AAU UK Fuggle hop pellets (0 min.) (2 oz./57 g at 4% alpha acids)
1 oz. (28 g) Fuggle hop pellets (dry hop)
Wyeast 1028 (London Ale) or White Labs WLP013 (London Ale) yeast
3⁄4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Mash the grains at 150–152 °F (65.6–66.7 °C) with 13 qts. (12 L) of hot water for 60 minutes. Run off the wort and sparge with hot water to give a final volume of about 6 gallons (23 L) in the brew pot. Bring the wort to a boil and add the first portion of Fuggle hops. Boil for 90 minutes, turn off the heat and add the second portion of Fuggle hops. Let the wort stand 30 minutes, run off from the trub and cool to about 70 °F (21 °C). Pitch the yeast, preferably as a 1-qt. (1-L) starter. Ferment for five days at 65–70 °F (18–21 °C), then rack to a secondary fermenter, adding the last portion of Fuggles in a sanitized, weighted mesh bag. Let the hops sit in the beer for seven to 10 days before racking. Bottle or keg in the usual manner, and drink as soon as the beer is conditioned.

Step by Step
Steep the grains with 3 qts. (3 L) of hot water at 140–150 °F (60–65.6 °C) for 30 minutes. Pull the grains out of the brewpot and drain the liquid into a brewpot, rinsing with an additional 3–4 qts. (3–4 L) of hot water. Add about half the liquid malt extract, stirring carefully to make sure it is properly dissolved, then top up the brewpot volume with water to 5 gallons (19 L).

Bring the water to a boil, add the Fuggle hops, and boil for 60 minutes. Add the remainder of the liquid malt extract 15 minutes before the end of the boil. Turn off the heat, add the first portion of Styrian Goldings, and allow the wort to rest for 30 minutes. Run the wort off from the trub, cool to about 70 °F (21 °C) and pitch the yeast, preferably as a 1-qt. (1-L) starter. Ferment for five days at 65–70 °F (18–21 °C), then rack to a secondary fermenter, adding the second portion of Styrian Goldings in a weighted, sanitized mesh bag. After seven to 10 days, bottle or keg in the usual manner, and drink as soon as the beer is conditioned.

Scale the 2-row pale malt down to 0.75 lbs. (0.34 kg), and add 3.25 lbs. (1.5 kg) light dried malt extract and 5 lbs. (2.3 kg) light liquid malt extract. Begin by heating 2.33 gallons (8.8 L) of water in your brew pot. In a separate pot, heat 0.66 gallons (2.5 L) of water to 161 °F (72 °C). Place the crushed grains in a steeping bag and submerge in this water. Steep for 30–45 minutes at 150 °F (66 °C). After steeping, remove the grain bag and let drip dry. Add "grain tea" and dried malt extract to brew pot and heat to a boil. Boil for 60 minutes, adding hops at times indicated. With 15 minutes left in the boil, stir in liquid malt extract. (Be sure to stir until extract is completely dissolved, or else extract may scorch.) After boil, let wort sit for 15 minutes before cooling. Then, cool wort and siphon to fermenter. Top up to 5 gallons (19 L), aerate and pitch yeast. Ferment at 68 °F (20 °C).

Funky Mead — Metheglin
Funky Mead - Metheglin
(5 gallons/19 L)
OG = 1.069 FG = 1.002
SRM = 2 ABV = 9.2%

Ingredients
9 lbs. (4.1 kg) fresh raw orange blossom honey (or favorite variety)
1 lb. (0.45 kg) clear or light candi sugar
1/2 tsp. gypsum
1/2 tsp. winemaker’s acid blend
Small quantities of grated bitter orange peel, coriander, ginger (to taste)
1/2 tsp. yeast nutrient
Belgian strong ale yeast
3/4 cup corn sugar for priming
Pinch dry champagne yeast

Step by Step
Bring 3 gal. (11 L) of water up 175 °F (80 °C) and add gypsum and acid blend and stir until dissolved. Add honey candi sugar, yeast nutrients, orange peel, coriander and ginger while trying to maintain the temperature at 175 °F (80 °C). Hold at this temperature for 15 minutes. Add 2 gal. (7.6 L) of water to lower the temperature to 70 °F (21 °C) or so.

Seal the fermenter, attach an air lock, and set it in a cool, dark place. Ferment at 65 to 75 °F (18 to 24 °C) for six weeks, rack to a carboy, and age 12 to 24 weeks. Then add a little dry champagne yeast (in bulk, not to the bottles, please!), prime with corn sugar, and bottle or keg and force carbonate. This will be a sparkling mead, obviously, effervescent like champagne. Funky, weird, unusual, different, in that order.

(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.038 FG = 1.009
IBU = 38 SRM = 4 ABV = 3.8%

Jarl is a simple recipe designed to showcase the grapefruit and lychee character of Citra® hops in a very sessionable pale ale. The difficulty lies in managing the brewing process in order to strike the right balance between the hops and malt. Fyne Ales’ flagship session ale is best enjoyed by the pint with friends.

Ingredients
6.92 lbs. (3.13 kg) Muntons extra pale ale malt
0.77 lb. (0.35 kg) Muntons torrified wheat
1.4 AAU Citra® leaf hops (60 min.) (0.1 oz./3 g at 14.3% alpha acids)
1.4 AAU Citra® leaf hops (30 min.) (0.1 oz./3 g at 14.3% alpha acids)
2.3 oz. (65 g) Citra® leaf hops (0 min.)
1⁄2 Whirlfloc tablet (10 min.)
SafAle US-05 or Mangrove Jack’s M44 (US West Coast) yeast
3⁄4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Using water with low mineral content will provide the best results. Fyne Ales treats their reverse osmosis water with Murphy & Sons DWB at a ratio of 0.1 oz./gallon (0.7 g/L) of collected wort (see their website if you want to find more information on DWB).

Using a 1.1 qts./lb. (2.3 L/kg) water-to-grist ratio, perform a single infusion mash with a target temperature of 153.5 °F (67.5 °C) for 60 minutes or until proper enzymatic conversion has occurred. Batch or fly sparge with 168 °F (76 °C) water to collect 7 gallons (26.5 L) of wort in the kettle.

Boil for 60 minutes, adding hops and fining agent as indicated. At flameout, add the last hop addition and stir vigorously to create a whirlpool. Rest for 20 minutes then rapidly chill the wort to 63 °F (17 ˚C) and transfer to primary fermenter. Aerate thoroughly and pitch plenty of healthy yeast.

Allow fermentation temperatures to free rise to a maximum of 73 °F (23 °C). Hold fermentation at 73 °F (23 ˚C) until terminal gravity of 1.009 is reached, usually within 5 to 7 days. Chill beer at a rate of 2 °F (1 °C) per hour until reaching 59 °F (15 °C) and then hold at that temperature for 24 hours. Resume chilling at a rate of 2 °F (1 °C) per hour until attaining 50 °F (10 °C) if cask conditioning or 32 °F (0 °C) if kegging or bottling.

Rack beer off yeast into a cask/keg for serving targeting 2.4 volumes of CO2 or prime and bottle, leaving the bottles at 70–75 °F (21–24 °C) for two weeks to properly condition.

Purge with carbon dioxide if it is available.

Tips for Success:
John Kimmich says that this beer was "dry hopped extensively with Cascade and Amarillo® hops," which makes me believe he either used a lot of dry hops in one stage or dry hopped this beer in two stages. I decided to go with the former in my clone attempt. Kimmich is a very technique-oriented brewer, so don’t be afraid to experiment with your dry hopping to try and find the best flavor profile. Bagging your hops in a muslin brewing bag commonly used for steeping grains can make them easier to retrieve when you are ready to remove them from the beer. If you bag your dry hops, however, keep in mind that it can reduce the hops exposure to the beer. Remedy this by making sure you don’t pack the bag of hops too tightly.

Be careful not to disturb the CO2 blanket on top of the beer during dry hopping. After you add the dry hops to the fermenter, re-establish the CO2 blanket by gently injecting CO2 across the top of the beer (if you have CO2 available to you in your homebrewery). If you have to open the fermenter for some reason during this period, repeat the process.

This beer’s relatively high terminal gravity led me to believe all-grain brewers should not go too low with their mash temperature. Remember when brewing any beer with a high gravity to pitch a healthy amount of active yeast cells. Beers made from underpitched worts start slower, and increase the stress on the yeast, producing more esters and fusel alcohols. Consider making a yeast starter a day ahead of your brew day to generate a healthy population of yeast before pitching. A general rule of thumb for pitching ale yeast is that you need 0.75 million cells per milliliter of wort per degree Plato. This translates to about a 1-L starter if using a stir plate and about a 2-L starter if you only swirl the starter every few hours.

Wyeast 3068 (Weihenstephan Weizen) or White Labs WLP300 (Hefeweizen Ale) or Lallemand Munich Classic yeast

Step by Step
Mill the grains and dough-in targeting a mash of around 1.5 quarts of water to 1 pound of grain (a liquor-to-grist ratio of about 3:1 by weight). If you have the ability to do a step mash, start with a rest at 110 °F (43 °C) for 20 minutes and then raise to a temperature of 152 °F (67 °C) until conversion is complete. Otherwise, do a single infusion mash at 151 °F (66 °C) until enzymatic conversion is complete. Infuse the mash with near boiling water while stirring or with a recirculating mash system raise the temperature to mash out at 168 °F (76 °C). Sparge slowly with 170 °F (77 °C) water, collecting wort until the pre-boil kettle volume is around 6.5 gallons (25 L) and the gravity is 1.038 (9.4 °P).

The total wort boil time is 90 minutes, which helps reduce the S-Methyl Methiomine (SMM) present in the lightly kilned pilsner malt and results in less Dimethyl sulfide (DMS) in the finished beer. Add the bittering hops with 60 minutes remaining in the boil. I skip using kettle finings in this beer, unless making a kristallweizen. Chill the wort rapidly to 62 °F (17 °C), let the break material settle, rack to the fermenter, pitch the yeast and aerate thoroughly. The proper pitch rate is 1.7 packages of fresh liquid yeast or 1 package of liquid yeast in a 1.3-liter starter.

Ferment at 62 °F (17 °C) until the beer attenuates fully. With healthy yeast, fermentation should be complete in a week, but do not rush it. The cooler than average ale fermentation temperature can extend the time it takes for complete attenuation. Rack to a keg and force carbonate or rack to a bottling bucket, add priming sugar, and bottle. Target a carbonation level of 2.5 to 3 volumes.

Step by Step
I have used a number of wheat extracts with good results. The type my homebrew shop carries is a private label made for them. Feel free to use whatever your shop recommends. Always choose the freshest extract that fits the beer style. If you cannot get fresh liquid malt extract, it is better to use an appropriate amount of dried malt extract (DME) instead. My hops are in pellet form and come from Hop Union.

Mix enough water with the malt extract to make a pre-boil volume of 5.9 gallons (22.3 L) and a gravity of 1.042 (10.4 °P). Stir thoroughly to help dissolve the extract and bring to a boil.

The total wort boil time is 60 minutes. Add the bittering hops with 60 minutes remaining in the boil. I skip using kettle finings in this beer, unless making a kristallweizen. Chill the wort rapidly to 62 °F (17 °C), let the break material settle, rack to the fermenter, pitch the yeast and aerate thoroughly. The proper pitch rate is 1.7 packages of fresh liquid yeast or 1 package of liquid yeast in a 1.3-liter starter.

German Pils
Pils
(5 gallon/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.048 FG = 1.011
IBU = 45 SRM = 3.4 ABV = 4.9%

This beer is hearty but very drinkable. It is hop-spicy upfront, with a solid mouthfeel and a crisp finish. Many German breweries nowadays make a Pils with much less hop character and a lower gravity than specified here, but this recipe is closer to the original guidelines for making this beer as it might have been brewed in the 19th century.

Ingredients
8.8 lbs. (4 kg) Pilsner malt
15.5 oz. (440 g) Carapils®/Carafoam® malt
6 AAU Tettnanger hops (60 min.) (1.5 oz./43 g at 4% alpha acids)
5.2 AAU Spalt hops (30 min.) (1.3 oz./36 g at 4% alpha acids)
2.6 AAU Mittelfrüh hops (5 min.) (0.6 oz./18 g at 4.25% alpha acids)
Wyeast 2247 (European Lager) or White Labs WLP830 (German Lager) or Saflager S-189 yeast
7⁄8 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
This recipe uses a multi-step infusion mash. Dough in at around 104 °F (40 °C) for a hydration rest of 15 minutes. Raise the temperature to 122 °F (50 °C) for a protein rest of 15 minutes. Raise the temperature to 149 °F (65 °C) for a beta amylase rest of 30 minutes. Raise the temperature to 162 °F (72 °C) for an alpha amylase rest of 30 minutes. Raise temperature to 169 °F (76 °C) for the mash-out. Recirculate wort then begin sparge.

Boil for 75 minutes, adding hops as indicated. At the end of the boil, turn off heat and whirlpool for 15 minutes. Heat-exchange to the high end of the temperature range for the selected yeast. As soon as primary fermentation is vigorous, reduce the tank temperature to the low end of the yeast’s temperature range. After 7 additional days, give the beer a diacetyl rest by raising the tank temperature to 66 °F (19 °C) and hold it there for about 2 days. Rack and reduce the beer temperature for lagering by 2 °F (1 °C ) a day until reaching 31 °F (–1 °C) or close to it, equipment permitting. The lagering temperature should definitely not be higher than 38 °F (3.5 °C). Lager for 4 to 6 weeks. Some brewers may shorten the lagering time to 2 to 4 weeks, others will lengthen it to 12 weeks. Rack again. Carbonate to 2.75 volumes of CO2.

Pils
(5 gallon/19 L, extract only)
OG = 1.048 FG = 1.011
IBU = 45 SRM = 3.4 ABV = 4.9%

Ingredients
6.6 lbs. (3 kg) Bavarian Pilsner liquid malt extract
6 AAU Tettnanger hops (60 min.) (1.5 oz./43 g at 4% alpha acids)
5.2 AAU Spalt hops (30 min.) (1.3 oz./36 g at 4% alpha acids)
2.6 AAU Mittelfrüh hops (5 min.) (0.6 oz./18 g at 4.25% alpha acids)
Wyeast 2247 (European Lager) or White Labs WLP830 (German Lager) or Saflager S-189 yeast
7⁄8 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step

Start with 5 gallons (19 L) brewing water in your pot. When water reaches 180 °F (82 °C) remove from heat and stir in the malt extract. Turn heat back on once all the extract is dissolved and bring wort to a boil. Boil for 60 minutes, adding hops as indicated. At the end of the boil, turn off heat and whirlpool for 15 minutes. Heat-exchange to the high end of the temperature range for the selected yeast and top off fermenter to 5 gallons (19 L). As soon as primary fermentation is vigorous, reduce the tank temperature to the low end of the yeast’s temperature range. After 7 additional days, give the beer a diacetyl rest by raising the tank temperature to 66 °F (19 °C) and hold it there for about 2 days. Rack and reduce the beer temperature for lagering by 2 °F (1 °C ) a day until reaching 31 °F (–1 °C) or close to it, equipment permitting. The lagering temperature should definitely not be higher than 38 °F (3.5 °C). Lager for 4 to 6 weeks. Some brewers may shorten the lagering time to 2 to 4 weeks, others will lengthen it to 12 weeks. Carbonate to approximately 2.75 volumes of CO2.

Tips for Success:

You can add the final hop addition with 5 minutes remaining in the boil, as suggested, or at flameout and whirlpool, or as a dry hop addition near the end of primary fermentation, depending on the character you are searching for. Brewers who prefer a very aromatic beer can even add the specified amount of aroma hops at more than one of these stages, or even all of them.

Step by Step
This is a multi-step infusion mash. Mash in at 122 °F (50 °C). Rest 30 minutes. Raise temperature to 144 °F (62 °C). Rest 20 minutes. Raise temperature to 162 °F (72 °C). Rest 20 minutes. Raise temperature to 172 °F (78 °C) for the mash-out. Transfer mash to lauter tun. Recirculate. Sparge to pre-boil gravity of about 1.042, assuming 1.5 gallons (5.7 L) evaporation during subsequent boil. Boil for 90 minutes. Bitter hop at 10 minutes into the boil; flavor hop at 60 minutes; aroma hop at 85 minutes. After the boil, verify OG in kettle.

Add water if too much evaporation occurred. Chill the wort down to the top of the selected yeast’s temper-ature range. Aerate the wort thoroughly. Maintain transfer temperature until primary fermentation is vigorous. Pull temperature down slowly to the bottom of the selected yeast’s tem-perature range. Rack at terminal gravity. Reduce temperature to about 34 °F (1 °C), or lower. Lager at least eight weeks (12 weeks is better). Prime the beer with a total of 4 oz. (112 g) of corn sugar. Technically, this is the equivalent of 2.5 volumes of CO2 (5 grams of CO2 per liter), measured at 50 °F (10 °C). Then package the brew.

A well-brewed Bavarian hefeweizen is one of the finest beers to enjoy on a warm summer day while the barbecue is going. Choosing a proper Bavarian hefe yeast and keeping fermentation temperatures in the appropriate range are key to proper banana (esters) and clove (phenolics) elements. Using a softer water profile can help keep the flavor profile more fluffy. Also, a slightly higher carbonation level can help achieve that goal.

Ingredients
6.6 lbs. (3 kg) wheat liquid malt extract
1 lb. (0.45 kg) wheat malt
3 AAU Czech Saaz hops (60 min.) (1 oz./28 g at 3% alpha acids)
2.3 AAU German Hallertau hops (15 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 4.5% alpha acids)
1 tsp. Irish moss (15 min.)
White Labs WLP300 (Hefeweizen Ale) or Wyeast 3068 (Weihenstephan Weizen) or Safbrew W-06 yeast
3⁄4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by step

Crush the grains and place in a muslin bag. Add 2.25 gallons (9 L) of cool water to your brew kettle and heat to 155 °F (68 °C). Add the muslin bag and steep for 30 minutes. Adjust the heat as needed to maintain the temperature. After 30 minutes, remove the kettle from the burner. Discard the muslin bag and add the malt extract slowly while stirring. Ensure the malt extract is completely dissolved before placing the kettle back on the burner to avoid scorching. Heat the kettle to a boil. Add hops and Irish moss as indicated. While boiling, sanitize your primary fermenter and add 2 gallons (8 L) of cold water.

When the boil is complete, chill the hot wort to 70–80 °F as quickly as you can and add it to the fermenter. Top up the fermenter with cold water to the 5-gallon (19-L) mark and stir the wort vigorously to oxygenate. Once the wort is between 68–72 °F (20–22 °C) take a gravity reading and pitch the prepared yeast into the wort.

Ferment at 68–72 °F (20–22 °C) until fermentation is complete, approximately 10–14 days. Bottle or keg as normal.

A low-ABV farmhouse beer style beer, meant for consumption after a long, hot day toiling in the fields. The turbid mash and unmalted grains help provide grainy character while the yeast is the main driver. Adding some a mild Brett yeast can be a fun twist. Brewers can substitute in flaked grains if berries are hard to come by.

Ingredients
5 lbs. (2.27 kg) undermodified Pilsner malt
0.3 lbs. (0.14 kg) unmalted white wheat berries, crushed or coarsely ground
0.3 lbs. (0.14 kg) oat berries, crushed or coarsely ground
3.75 AAU Perle hops (60 min.) (0.5 oz/14 g at 7.5% alpha acid)
2.5 AAU Perle hops (20 min.) (0.33 oz./9 g at 7.5% alpha acid)
2.5 AAU German Hallertau hops (5 min.) (0.5 oz/14 g at 5% alpha acid)
Belgian Wit, Saison or Abbey Ale yeast
3/4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Heat 1.7 qt. (1.6 L) of strike water to 138 °F (59 °C). Dough-in grain at 113 °F (45 °C) for 10 minutes. Raise temp of mash to 136 °F (58 °C) by the addition of 2.5 qt. (2.4 L) of boiling water, hold 5 minutes.

Drop in stuykmanden and draw off about 1 qt. (1 L) of liquid. Heat the drawn off or turbid portion to between 180 – 212 °F (82 – 100 °C). Raise temperature of mash to 150 °F (66 °C) by the addition of 3.5 qt. (3.3 L) of boiling water and hold 30 minutes. Drop in stuykmanden and draw off about 1 gal. (3.8 L) of liquid into the turbid portion.

Re-raise temperature of turbid portion to between 180 – 212 °F (82 – 100 °C). Raise temperature of mash to 162 °F (72 °C) by the addition of 3.5 qt. (3.3 L) of boiling water and hold 20 min. Drop temperature of turbid mash to 176 °F (80 °C).

Drain the free liquid in the mash tun to the kettle as if you were batch sparging. Gently pour the turbid portion over the grains to bring the mash temperature to 167 °F (75 °C), hold for 20 minutes.

Lauter as normal. Boil 60 minutes. Ferment on the warmer end of your yeast strain’s range. You may want to experiment with dry hopping, maybe a half ounce of a nice aroma hop like Saaz or Hallertau.

"This beer dates from 2017 — it has nothing to do with any current extremist groups. It is a reference to Breakin’ Two: Electric Boogaloo. It was both our second beer made specifically for them, as well as their 20th anniversary, so a repeat theme made sense. But this is really the only packaged beer that we’ve dip hopped extensively. We tend to ‘bring it’ to other breweries more often than use it ourselves, or we use it as just a small part of a larger hopping procedure. This is pure dip hop."
– Van Havig, Master Brewer, Gigantic Brewing Company

Ingredients
9.8 lbs. (4.5 kg) Mecca Grade Lamonta pale malt (Maris Otter or other)
6 oz. (170 g) Simpsons medium crystal malt (65 °L)
0.8 AAU Nugget hops (90 min.) (0.07 oz./2 g at 12% alpha acids)
10.7 AAU Crystal hops (5 min.) (2.7 oz./75 g at 4% alpha acids)
1.8 oz. (51 g) Mosaic® hops (dip hop)
1.8 oz. (51 g) Simcoe® hops (dip hop)
1.8 oz. (51 g) Citra® hops (dip hop)
Wyeast 1728 (Scottish Ale), White Labs WLP028 (Edinburgh Scottish Ale), Imperial Yeast A31 (Tartan Ale), or LalBrew Nottingham Ale yeast
3⁄4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
This is a single step infusion mash at 150 °F (66 °C). Hold at this temperature for 90 minutes before lautering. Collect roughly 6.5 gallons (25.6 L) of wort in your boil kettle. This is a 90-minute boil, adding your first hop addition at the start of the boil.

About one hour before cooling the wort, add the dip hops to a clean and sanitized fermenter. Add about 1.5 qts. (1.5 L) of water at 175–185 °F (80–85 °C). Pellets should be cold — the hop and water solution will come down to 140 °F (60 °C) or so. Don’t worry about it too much. If you used hot enough water, it will be "hot enough."

When boil is complete, cool wort and add to the fermenter. You should be adding about 5 gallons (19 L) into the dip-hop solution already in the fermenter. Aim for a fermentation temperature of 72 °F (22 °C); when these strains are fermented warm, they can be quite estery.

Van Havig recommends that brewers remove the yeast from the beer after conditioning. "We fine our beers the old fashioned way with isinglass — because technology isn’t always the answer," he said.

Ingredients
6 lbs. 14 oz. (3.1 kg) Dingemans Pilsen malt
3 lbs. 11 oz. (1.7 kg) unmalted wheat
3 oz. (84 g) aged (debittered) hops
Wyeast 3278 (Lambic Blend) blend of yeasts and bacteria
0.75 cups corn sugar (for priming)

Step by Step
Heat 2.7 gallons (10 L) of water to 124 °F (51 °C) in your kettle. Bring 5 gallons (19 L) of water to a boil in your hot liquor tank. Mash grains in to 113 °F (45 °C) and let rest for 10 minutes. You will step through the following steps: 131 °F (55 °C) for 15 minutes; 149 °F (65 °C) for 45 minutes; 162 °F (72 °C) for 15 minutes; mash out to 170 °F (76 °C). For each step, add about 85 fl. oz. (2.5 L) of boiling water, then use direct heat to hit target temperature. (By the end of your mash, it will be very thin.)

Cool water in hot liquor tank to 200 °F (95 °C) and use this for your sparge water. Collect about 5 gallons (19 L) of wort, add 2 gallons (7.6 L) of water and boil for 2 hours, adding hops with 90 minutes left in boil. Ferment beer at 70 °F (21 °C) in a plastic bucket for one week. Let beer condition at 70–80 °F (21–27 °C) for 3 months, then hold at "room temperature." Do not rack to secondary. Do this once a year for three years, then blend beers after the most recent has been warm conditioned for three months.

8.5 lbs. (3.9 kg) Maris Otter pale malt
14 oz. (0.39 kg) Pilsner malt
10 oz. (0.28 kg) flaked barley
12 oz. (0.34 kg) Carapils® dextrin malt
2.5 lbs. (1.13 kg) clover honey (5 min.)
5.25 AAU Centennial hop pellets (60 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 10.5 % alpha acids)
2.6 AAU Centennial hop pellets (30 min.) (0.25 oz./7 g at 10.5% alpha acids)
5.25 AAU Centennial hop pellets (0 min.) (0.5 oz./14.2 g at 10.5% alpha acids)
1⁄2 tsp. yeast nutrient (15 min.)
1⁄2 tsp. Irish moss (15 min.)
White Labs WLP 001 (American Ale) or Wyeast 1056 (American Ale) yeast
3/4 cup (150 g) dextrose (if bottling)

Step by Step
Mix the crushed grains with 4.5 gallons (17 L) of 175 °F (79 °C) water to stabilize at 155 °F (68 °C) for 60 minutes. Sparge slowly with 175 °F (79 °C) water. Collect approximately 6 gallons (23 L) of wort runoff to boil for 60 minutes. Add the hops, honey, Irish moss, and yeast nutrient as per the schedule. Cool the wort to 75 °F (24 °C). Pitch your yeast and aerate the wort heavily. Allow the beer to cool to 68 °F (20 °C). Hold at that temperature until fermentation is complete. Transfer to a carboy, avoiding any splashing to prevent aerating the beer. Allow the beer to condition for 1 week and then bottle or keg.

Extract with grains option:
Reduce the 2-row pale malt in the all-grain recipe to 14 oz. (0.39 kg) and replace the Maris Otter pale malt with 6.6 lbs. (3 kg) Muntons light, unhopped, malt extract and 2.5 lbs. (1.13 kg) dried malt extract. Steep the crushed grains in 5.5 gallons (21 L) of water for 30 minutes. Remove grains from the wort and rinse with 2 quarts (1.8 L) of hot water. Add the liquid and dried malt extracts and boil for 60 minutes. Follow the remaining portion of the all-grain recipe.

This is a recipe I have brewed many times in many ways and is a great starting recipe for anyone trying to get their start in brewing, let alone gluten-free brewing. If you’re using sorghum for the extract version recipe, my advice is to lean into the phenols that sorghum tends to produce (e.g. some describe it as metallic, chlorophenolic, or "twang-y") with hops that complement its natural flavors. I chose Cascade for this recipe as it is one of the easiest to source and it will likely bring back memories for those who drank barley beer before being diagnosed or changing diets. The grapefruit/resin-y taste that Cascade and other hops like Cascade emit are a great pairing with Sorghum and help to make an excellent all-around pale ale for any season – quaffable and tasty.

Ingredients
9 lbs. (4.1 kg) pale millet malt
2 lbs. (0.9 kg) CaraMillet malt (3 °L)
1.5 lbs. (0.68 kg) biscuit rice malt
1 lb. (0.45 kg) pale buckwheat malt
0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) crystal rice malt
1 lb. (0.45 kg) maltodextrin (15 min.)
1 Tbsp. Termamyl Endo-Alpha Amylase
1 Tbsp. SEBamyl L
Whirlfloc tablet (15 min.)
Yeast nutrient (15 min.)
5 AAU Cascade hops (60 min.) (1 oz./28 g at 5% alpha acids)
1 oz. (28 g) Cryo® Cascade hops (0 min.)
1 oz. (28 g) Cascade hops (dry hop)
SafAle S-04 or Mangrove Jack’s M15 (Empire Ale) yeast
3⁄4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Heat 6 gallons (23 L) of strike water to 165 °F (74 °C), add 1 heaping Tbsp. of Termamyl Endo-Alpha Amylase. Mash in grains. The temperature of the mash will drop to about 150 °F (66 °C). Add 1 heaping Tbsp. of SEBamyl L. Rest for 1.5–2 hours, or until mash passes iodine test. You may want to raise mash temperature to 160 °F (71 °C) after an hour. Recirculate and heat mash to 168 °F (76 °C). Sparge with about 2.5 gallons (9.5 L) of water or enough to collect 6.5 gallons (25.6 L).

Boil for 60 minutes, adding hops according to the ingredients list. With 15 minutes remaining in the boil, mix maltodextrin with warm water before adding directly to boil — enough water to make it aqueous. Also add the Whirlfloc and yeast nutrients. At the end of the boil, turn off the heat and add the Cryo® hops. Give the wort a long stir to create a whirlpool, then let settle for 15 minutes.

Chill wort to yeast-pitching temperature and transfer to fermenter. Ferment at 68 °F (20 °C) until the gravity falls to 1.015 or below. Rack to secondary with 1 oz. (28 g) of Cascade hops. Cold crash after 3 days and then hold until it’s as bright as you like. Bottle or keg as usual.

Looking for something amber, caramelly, and hopped up? Another fun recipe that is reminiscent of the IPAs of a decade or two ago, with modern hopping techniques. I get a nice spicy pine off the bittering hops and amazing resin and fruit notes off the late hop additions, which complement a caramelly malt profile (especially in the all-grain version of this recipe). You can add more extract syrup to make this a double IPA if you feel that suits the color of this beer better. It’s designed to be fun to make and fun to drink!

Step by Step
Buy milled grains or mill grains at home (I use the triple blade Ninja blender at home for a few seconds because the grains are so small you need three passes in a mill). Place crushed grains in a muslin bag. Heat 7 gallons (27 L) of water to 135 °F (57 °C), then submerge the grains in the water and add 1/2 Tbsp. alpha amylase. Hold at this temperature for 30 minutes, then heat to 150 °F (66 °C). After 30 minutes, begin to heat to boil. Remove grains when the temperature hits 170 °F (77 °C), then stir in the syrup.

Bring to a boil and add hops according to the ingredients list. Add the Whirlfloc and yeast nutrients with 15 minutes remaining in the boil.

At the end of the boil, remove from heat and add the final hop addition. Give the wort a long stir to create a whirlpool, then let settle. Chill the wort to yeast-pitching temperature before adding the yeast. Ferment at 68 °F
(20 °C) until the gravity reaches 1.017 or below. Rack to secondary with 1 oz. (28 g) each of Centennial and Simcoe® hops. Cold crash after 3 days, add biofine if you so desire and hold until it’s as bright as you like. Bottle or

Glutinous Butt (Wheat Porter)
Glutinous Butt (Wheat Porter)
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.056 FG = 1.014
IBU = 48 SRM = 33 ABV = 5.4%

This beer is essentially a porter formulated with a wheat beer base. (The name comes from the fact that wheat has a high gluten content compared to barley and some porters used to be referred to as entire or entire butt.) The Glacier hops give an "earthy" hop flavor to the beer that works well with the roasted grains. Brew this and, at your next homebrew club meeting, everyone will be glad to see your Glutinous Butt.

Ingredients
5.5 lbs. (2.5 kg) wheat malt
4.25 lbs. (1.9 kg) Pilsner malt
8.0 oz. (0.23 kg) crystal malt (40 °L)
6.0 oz. (0.17 kg) crystal malt (60 °L)
8.0 oz. (0.23 kg) chocolate malt
4.0 oz. (0.11 kg) black patent malt
3.0 oz. (0.09 kg) roasted barley (500 °L)
11 AAU Newport hops (60 mins) (0.79 oz./22 g of 14% alpha acids)
0.75 oz. (21 g) Glacier hops (15 mins)
Wyeast 1028 (London Ale) yeast (2 qt./2 L yeast starter)
7⁄8 cup corn sugar (for priming)

Step by Step
Single infusion mash at 153 °F (67 °C) in 16 qts. (15 L) of mash liquor. Mash out to 168 °F (76 °C). Recirculate, then run off wort. Sparge water should be hot enough to keep grain bed temperature near 168 °F (76 °C). Be careful not to oversparge. Stop collecting when specific gravity of final runnings falls below 1.010 (or pH climbs above 5.8) — about 6.0 gallons (23 L) of wort total. Bring wort to a boil. Once first signs of hot break appear, add first dose of hops and boil for 60 minutes. Add finishing hops with 15 minutes left in boil. Cool wort to 68 °F (20 °C) and transfer to fermenter. Aerate and pitch yeast. Ferment at 68 °F (20 °C) for 7–10 days, then rack to secondary fermenter. After 4–7 days in secondary, rack to bottling bucket or keg.

1⁄2 tsp. calcium sulfate (gypsum) or calcium chloride
1 tsp. calcium carbonate (chalk) or 1⁄2 tsp. sodium bicarbonate (baking soda)
Wyeast 1028 (London Ale) yeast (2 qt./2 L yeast starter)
7⁄8 cup corn sugar (for priming)

Step by Step
This recipe uses a modification of countertop partial mash procedures. You will need a 2-gallon (7.6-L) beverage cooler and two grain bags, one large enough to hold four pounds of grain. Begin by heating 5.5 qts. (5.2 L) of soft or distilled water to 165 °F (74 °C) in a large kitchen pot. Stir 1⁄2 tsp. calcium sulfate (gypsum) or calcium chloride into this water. In another pot, heat 2.75 qts (2.6 L) of soft water to around
164 °F (73 °C). Stir 1 tsp. calcium carbonate (chalk) or 1⁄2 tsp. sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) into this water. In your brewpot, begin heating a half-gallon (~2 L) of water to around 170 °F (77 °C). (Tap water is fine, as long as it tastes good.) Place crushed pale malts (Pilsner and wheat) in one grain bag and place in cooler. Put remaining crystal and dark malts (all crushed) in the other bag. Add the 5.5 qts. (5.2 L) of water to the pale grains in the cooler and stir it in. Let this mash, starting at 154 °F (68 °C), for 45 minutes. Likewise, steep the specialty grains in the pot of carbonate-rich water for 45 minutes (around 153 °F/67 °C), although this exact temperature is not critical. While grains mash and steep, heat about 8.0 qts. (7.6 L) of water (tap is fine) to 180 °F (82 °C).

When mashing and steeping is complete, scoop 1 qt. (~1 L) of 170 °F (77 °C) water from your brewpot (you can use a large measuring cup for this). Lift the specialty grains out of their steeping pot and place in a colander over your brewpot. Pour the "grain tea" through the grain bag (to strain out any large bits of grain) and then rinse the grains with the water pulled from your brewpot. Start heating this "grain tea" while you collect the wort from the cooler. To collect wort from mash, recirculate about 2.5 qts. (2.4 L) of wort, then add 180 °F (82 °C) water to cooler until it is full to the rim. Draw off wort and add to brewpot until the liquid level in the cooler is just above the grain bed. Add 180 °F (82 °C) water to the rim again. Repeat this process until you have collected 2.0 gallons/8 qts. (7.6 L) of wort. Add dried malt extract and bring wort to a boil. Add first dose of hops and boil for 60 minutes.

Add hops at times indicated in the ingredient list. Cool wort, in sink or with wort chiller, to 68 °F (20 °C) and transfer to fermenter. Add water to top up to 5 gallons (19 L), aerate and pitch yeast. Ferment at 68 °F (20 °C) for 7–10 days, then rack to secondary fermenter. After 4–7 days in secondary, rack to bottling bucket or keg.

Gold Hammer Gose
Gold Hammer Gose
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.040 FG = 1.006
IBU = 8 SRM = 3 ABV = 4.3%

This is a straightforward recipe for a classic, refreshing Gose.

Ingredients
5.25 lbs. (2.4 kg) pale barley malt
2.8 lbs. (1.3 kg) red wheat malt
~2 oz. (57 g) rice hulls
1.9 AAU Chinook hops (45 min.) (0.15 oz./4 g at 12.8% alpha acids)
0.02 oz. (0.4 g) Indian coriander (fine ground) (0 min.)
0.62 oz. (17.6 g) sea salt
Lactobacillus culture, such as Wyeast 5335, White Labs WLP672, or WildBrew™ Sour Pitch
White Labs WLP029 (German Ale/Kölsch) or Wyeast 1007 (German Ale) or SafAle K-97 yeast
3⁄4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by step
Mash in at 154 °F (68 °C) with the grains and rice hulls. Rest 60 minutes and lauter. As the kettle fills, begin to introduce an inert gas (usually nitrogen, but CO2 works well too) into the top of the kettle. Stop runoff at 1.008. Once the wort is in the kettle, mix in cooled water to achieve a temperature of 118 °F (48 °C) — or recommended pitch temperature from the manufacturer — and a gravity of about 1.034. Add Lactobacillus propagation. Pitching rate is ~500 mL at 1 x 108 cells per mL (or approximately 5 x 1010 total). Hold at the recommended souring temperature. Allow to sour to desired pH (between 3.3–3.5). Once the pH is reached, boil the wort for 45 minutes, adding hops at beginning of the boil and the coriander at the end.

Pitch German ale yeast at 68–70 °F (20–21°C). At the end of fermentation add the fully hydrated salt solution at a rate of 0.124 oz. per gallon (0.92 g/L). Bottle and prime or keg and force carbonate as usual.

Extract only option: Rice hulls are not needed. Swap out the pale and wheat malts for 2.2 lbs. (1 kg) wheat dried malt extract and 2 lbs. (0.91 kg) extra light dried malt extract. Heat 23 qts. (22 L) to 180 °F (82 °C) and stir in the dried malt extract. Hold at this temperature for 15 minutes for pasteurization, then cool wort to Lacto pitching temperature. Follow all-grain instructions for the remainder of the steps.

Wyeast 3068 (Weihenstephan Weizen) yeast
0.75 cups corn sugar (for priming)
1.0 oz. (28 g) heading powder (optional for extra head retention)

Step by Step
Place all grains in a grain bag in the boil kettle. Water should be at 150–155 °F (66–68 °C). Turn off heat and steep for 30 minutes. Remove grains from kettle and slowly add wheat drid malt extract (DME) to kettle while stirring. Once DME is dissolved, return kettle to heat and bring to a boil.

Make first hop addition at beginning of boil. Total boil time is 60 minutes. With 20 minutes left, add the second crystal hops, two tsp. Irish moss, 1⁄2 C. maltodextrin and 2 tsp citric acid or fresh lemon or orange.

Make final hop addition at the end of the boil and turn off the heat. Cool wort to 70–75 °F (21–24 °C), pitch yeast and aerate well. Consider using a blow off tube as this is a pretty aggressive fermenter.

Ferment one to two weeks and rack off into secondary for an additional week. At bottling time, use 2/3 cup corn sugar, and 1 oz. (28 g) of heading powder if you want some extra head retention. Condition for three weeks and enjoy!

All-grain Option:
Your grain bill is 7.5 lbs. (3.4 kg) wheat malt, 3.5 lbs. (1.6 kg) Pilsner two-row malt, 0.5 lbs. (0.23 kg) flaked wheat and 0.375 lbs. (0.17 kg) crystal malt (10 °L). Mash water volume is 3.5 gallons (13 L). Mash temperature: 145-150 °F (63-66 °C), mash for 60 minutes, ensure starch has been converted.

Sparge with hot water at 170 °F (77 °C) and collect 5.5 gallons (21 L) of wort. Boil for 60 minutes, adding hops at times indicated in ingredients. Cool wort, transfer to fermenter and pitch yeast.

Ferment for one to two weeks and rack to the secondary for a week. Bottle and prime with corn sugar.

Alem Bier’s Muscat Brett Saison clone
Alem Bier’s Muscat Brett Saison clone
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.056 FG = 1.007
IBU = 13 SRM = 3 ABV = 6.8%

This saison with Brettanomyces from Alem Bier in Flores da Cunha, Brazil incorporates local Muscat grapes.

Ingredients
11.5 lbs. (5.2 kg) Pilsner malt
7 AAU Magnum hops (60 min.) (0.7 oz./20 g at 10% alpha acids)
1.25 gallons (5 L) Muscat grape must
French oak, medium toast
Bio4 Saison and LevTeck B1 (Brettanomyces blend), or Wyeast 3711 (French Saison) and White Labs WLP650 (Brettanomyces bruxellensis), or The Yeast Bay WLP4636 (Saison/Brettanomyces Blend II)
7⁄8 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by step
This recipe uses reverse osmosis (RO) water. Adjust all brewing water to a pH of 5.5 using phosphoric acid. Add 0.5 tsp. calcium chloride and 0.5 tsp. of calcium sulfate to the mash.

This recipe uses a step mash. In 18 quarts (17 L) water, mash in at 104 °F (40 °C) for 10 minutes. Raise to 126 °F (52 °C) for 10 minutes. Raise to 144 °F (62 °C) for 60 minutes. Raise to 153 °F (67 °C) for 10 minutes. Mash out at 169 °F (76 °C) for 15 minutes, recirculating.

Sparge slowly and collect 6.5 gallons (24.5 L) of wort.

Boil the wort for 60 minutes, adding hops at the beginning of the boil.

Chill the wort to 79 °F (26 °C), pitch the yeast, and ferment. When the beer is about 1.020 gravity, add the grape must, and ferment until complete.

At the brewery, this beer is aged in an old French oak barrel that had Ancellotta wine in it (an Italian grape variety with plantings in Brazil). Brettanomyces was pitched in the barrels. This can be simulated by using French oak cubes or spirals, pre-boiled for 15 minutes prior to use. Use 1 oz. (28 g) of oak for 9–12 months along with the Brett. Age the beer at cellar temperatures, 54–62 °F (12–17 °C), during this time.

Rack the beer, prime, and bottle condition, or keg and force carbonate to a high carbonation level.

(5 gallons/19 L, extract only)
OG = 1.056 FG = 1.007
IBU = 26 SRM = 3 ABV = 6.8%

Ingredients
6.2 lbs. (2.8 kg) Pilsen dried malt extract
7 AAU Magnum hops (60 min.) (0.7 oz./20 g at 10% alpha acids)
1.25 gallons (5 L) Muscat grape must

7⁄8 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by step
Use 6.5 gallons (24.5 L) of water in the brew kettle; heat to 158 °F (70 °C).

Turn off the heat. Add the malt extract and stir thoroughly to dissolve completely. You do not want to feel liquid extract at the bottom of the kettle when stirring with your spoon. Turn the heat back on and bring to a boil.

Boil the wort for 60 minutes, adding hops at the times indicated in the recipe.

Chill the wort to 79 °F (26 °C), pitch the yeast, and ferment. When the beer is about 1.020 gravity, add the grape must, and ferment until complete.

Rack the beer, prime, and bottle condition, or keg and force carbonate to a high carbonation level.

Tips for Success:
The yeasts used by Alem Bier are Brazilian, so some substitution is probably necessary (we’ve provided a couple of suggestions) but you could substitute with some other favorites of yours. Use a saison strain that is not overly clove-like. The Brett blend is mostly B. bruxellensis, but it is not very funky — it is floral and fruity. The Brett can take the beer down to 1.000 gravity.

The Moscato (Muscat) grape is very fresh, peachy, and floral in character. The target combination of the beer is to be floral and fruity with a bubbly texture, like a high-quality Asti sparkling wine.

The beer I judged was aged in the bottle for a further year and a half; two years would be a good target if you can wait that long.

8 oz. (0.23 kg) Belgian caramel Munich malt
2 oz. (57 g) roasted barley (300 °L)
4.5 lbs. (2 kg) Muntons light dried malt extract
8.5 AAUs Pilgrim hops (60 min.) (1 oz./28 g of 8.5% alpha acids)
2.5 AAUs Celia hops (15 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g of 5% alpha acids)
2 AAUs Styrian Golding hops (15 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g of 4% alpha acids)
5 AAUs Celia hops (1 min.) (1 oz./28 g of 5% alpha acid)
1 tsp. Irish moss (15 min.)
Wyeast 1968 (London ESB) or White Labs WLP002 (English Ale) or Lallemand London ESB Ale yeast
3/4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by step
Bring 1/2 gallon (2 L) of water to 155 °F (68 °C), add crushed grain and hold for 30 minutes at 150 °F (66 °C). Strain the grain into the brewpot and sparge with one gallon (3.8 L) of 168 °F (76 °C) water. Add the dry malt extract and first round of hops. Bring the total volume in the brewpot to 3 gallons (11 L). Boil for 45 minutes, then add the flavor hops and Irish moss. Boil for 14 minutes, then add the aroma hops. Boil for 1 minute, then remove the pot from the stove. Cool wort for 15 minutes in an ice bath or chill with wort chiller. Strain into the primary fermenter and add water to obtain 5.25 gallons (20 L). Add yeast when wort has cooled to below 80 °F (27 °C).

Oxygenate-aerate well. Ferment at 68 °F (20 °C) for 7 days, then rack into secondary (glass carboy). Ferment until target gravity has been reached and beer has cleared (approximately 3 weeks). Keg and force carbonate or prime and bottle. If bottling, carbonate at 70 to 72 °F (21 to 22 °C) for 2 to 3 weeks. This bitter is ready to drink 1 month after it is carbonated. It will peak between 1 and 3 months and will last for 6 months.

All-Grain option:
Acidify the mash water to below 7 pH. Mash 8.5 lbs. (3.9 kg) British two-row pale malt and the specialty grains in 3.25 gallons (12.3 L) of water at 152 °F (67 °C) for 90 minutes. Sparge with 4.75 gallons (18 L) of water at 5.7 pH and 168 °F (76 °C). The total boil time is 90 minutes. Add the hops and Irish moss as indicated by the partial mash recipe.

Step by Step
This recipe uses reverse osmosis (RO) water. Adjust all brewing water to a pH of 5.5 using phosphoric acid. Add 1 tsp. of CaCl2 to the mash.

Put the chocolate malt in a mesh bag and steep briefly in the full volume of the hot strike water before the mash begins. Steep just long enough so that a deep reddish color appears. This should only take a few seconds, but you may have to stir the water to judge the color effect. Remove the bag when a reddish color is noticed.

Mash in pale ale and Munich malts at 151 °F (66 °C) using a 1.5 qts./lb. (3.1 L/kg) water-to-grist ratio. Rest for 60 minutes. Add the crystal malt, begin recirculating, and raise the temperature to 168 °F (76 °C) for mash out. Recirculate slowly for at least 15 minutes. Add the first wort hops to the kettle before beginning runoff.

Sparge slowly and collect 6.5 gallons (24.5 L) of wort in your kettle. Boil the wort for 90 minutes, adding remaining hops at the times indicated in the recipe. Add the last Cascade hops after heat has been turned off and the wort has cooled for 10 minutes. Give a long stir to create a whirlpool then let settle for 10 minutes.

Chill the wort to 68 °F (20 °C), pitch the yeast, and ferment until complete. After conditioning, rack the beer, prime and bottle condition, or keg and force carbonate.

Step by Step

Two or three days before brew day, make a 2-qt. (2-L) yeast starter, aerating the wort thoroughly (preferably with oxygen) before pitching the yeast. This recipe uses RO water. Add 1⁄4 tsp. 10% phosphoric acid per 5 gallons (19 L) of water. Use 1⁄2 tsp. calcium chloride and 1⁄2 tsp. gypsum in the mash.

Mash all grains in 15 qts. (14 L) of 152 °F (67 °C) water for 60 minutes. Sparge with 169 °F (76 °C) water until 6.5 gallons (25 L) of wort are collected (put the FWH hops in the kettle while sparging). Boil for 75 minutes, adding hops at the indicated times. The 0 minute hops are added after the heat is turned off. The hopback hops are used in a hopback between the kettle and the chiller. If you do not have a hopback, you can add these as you begin chilling the wort. Chill to 64 °F (18 °C).

Oxygenate, then pitch the yeast starter. Ferment at 64 °F (18 °C) until completed. Prime and bottle condition, or keg and force carbonate.

Gordon Strong's American Robust Porter
American Robust Porter
by Gordon Strong, Beavercreek, Ohio
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.056 FG = 1.016
IBU = 31 SRM = 30 ABV = 5.2%

This is a more modern take on an American robust porter, although it probably falls in between the BJCP Brown Porter and Robust Porter categories. Note the general similarity with the second recipe in this collection. It also is a nice base beer for a smoked porter; add a half pound of German rauchmalz and lower the bitterness to about 25 IBUs. For a more ‘robust’ American version, double the black malt, add 2 more pounds (0.9 kg) of base malt, and increase the late hops.

Ingredients

3 lbs. (1.36 kg) US 2-row pale malt
3 lbs. (1.36 kg) Maris Otter pale ale malt
3 lbs. (1.36 kg) German Vienna malt
1 lb. (0.45 kg) German Munich malt
1 lb. (0.45 kg) UK crystal malt (60 °L)
8 oz. (0.23 kg) UK chocolate malt
8 oz. (0.23 kg) wheat malt
4 oz. (0.11 kg) UK black malt
6 AAU Northern Brewer hops (60 mins) (0.75 oz./21 g of 8% alpha acids)
6 AAU Northern Brewer hops (10 mins) (0.75 oz./21 g of 8% alpha acids)
4.5 AAU Cascade hops (2 mins) (0.75 oz./21 g of 6% alpha acids)
Wyeast 1272 (American Ale II™) (1 qt./1 L yeast starter)
3⁄4 cup corn sugar (for priming)

Step by Step

Two or three days before brew day, make the yeast starter, aerating the wort thoroughly (preferably with oxygen) before pitching the yeast.

On brew day, mash in the malt at 154 °F (68 °C) in 17 qts. (16 L) of water. Hold at this temperature for 60 minutes. Raise the mash temperature to 170 °F (77 °C), hold for 5 minutes then recirculate. Run off wort and sparge with water hot enough to keep the grain bed around 170 °F (77 °C). Collect 6.5 gallons (25 L) of wort.

Check that final runnings do not drop below SG 1.010. Boil the wort for 60 minutes, adding hops at times indicated in the ingredients list. Ferment at 64 °F (18 °C).

Variation: Add 0.5 lbs (0.23 kg) German rauchmalz to the mash and reduce bittering (60 mins.) hops to 0.5 oz. (14 g).

3.3 AAU Hallertauer hops (10 min.) (1 oz./28 g at 3.3% alpha acids)
4.9 AAU Styrian Goldings hops (5 min.) (1 oz./28 g at 4.9% alpha acids)
Wyeast 3787 (Trappist High Gravity) or White Labs WLP530 (Abbey Ale) or Safbrew BE-256 yeast
3⁄4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
This recipe uses reverse osmosis (RO) water. Adjust all brewing water to a pH of 5.5 using phosphoric acid. Add 1 tsp. of calcium chloride to the mash.

Step mash: Mash in base malts (Pilsner and aromatic) and maize at 131 °F (55 °C) and rest for 15 minutes. Increase to 146 °F (63 °C) using direct heat or infusion and hold for 40 minutes. Increase to 158 °F (70 °C) using direct heat or infusion and hold for 15 minutes. Add crystal malt and raise to 168 °F (76 °C) for 15 minutes, recirculating the wort. Fly sparge with 170 °F (77 °C) water, collecting 6.5 gallons (25 L) of wort.

Boil the wort for 90 minutes, adding hops at the times indicated in the recipe. At the end of the boil, chill the wort to 67 °F (19 °C), pitch the yeast, and ferment until complete. Rack the beer. Rack and package the beer, or rack and clarify the beer if desired with finings before packaging (prime with corn sugar and bottle condition, or keg and force carbonate).

This recipe uses a step mash. Mash in the Pilsner, pale ale, Munich, dark Munich, and aromatic malts at 144 °F (62 °C) in 23 qts. (22 L) water. Hold for 45 minutes. Raise the temperature to 158 °F (70 °C) and hold for 15 minutes. Add crystal and chocolate malt. Begin recirculating and raise temperature to 168 °F (76 °C) and recirculate for 15 minutes. Sparge slowly and collect 6.5 gallons (24.5 L) of wort.

Boil the wort for 90 minutes, adding hops at the times indicated in the recipe. Add the sugars at the end of the boil and stir to dissolve.

Chill the wort to 64 °C (18 °F), pitch the yeast, and ferment until complete. Allow the beer to free rise in temperature during fermentation.

Rack the beer, prime and bottle (or cask) condition, or keg and force carbonate the beer.

Belgian Pale Ale
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.047 FG = 1.010
IBU = 25 SRM = 12 ABV = 5%

Ingredients
6 lbs. (2.7 kg) Pilsner malt
2.5 lbs. (1.1 kg) Vienna malt
8 oz. (227 g) aromatic malt
8 oz. (227 g) Caramunich® III malt or crystal malt (80 °L)
6 oz. (170 g) biscuit malt
0.4 oz. (11 g) debittered black malt
5 AAU Saaz hops (60 min.) (1 oz./28 g at 5% alpha acids)
2.5 AAU Saaz hops (10 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 5% alpha acids)
0.5 oz. (14 g) Saaz hops (2 min.)
White Labs WLP515 (Antwerp Ale), Wyeast 3655 (Belgian Schelde Ale), Omega Yeast OYL-049 (Belgian Ale DK), or SafAle S-33 yeast
3⁄4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
This recipe uses reverse osmosis (RO) water. Adjust all brewing water to a pH of 5.5 using phosphoric acid. Add 0.5 tsp. each calcium chloride and calcium sulfate to the mash.

Mash the Pilsner, Vienna, and aromatic malts at 151 °F (66 °C) for 60 minutes. Start recirculating wort. Add remaining malts and raise the temperature to 168 °F (76 °C) for 15 minutes. Sparge slowly and collect 6.5 gallons (24.5 L) of wort.

Boil the wort for 90 minutes, adding hops at the times indicated in the recipe. The longer boil will help drive off the precursor compounds of dimethyl sulfide (DMS), found in Pilsner malt. You can add a kettle fining agent if you so desire.

After the boil is complete, chill the wort to 64 °F (18 °C), pitch the yeast, and ferment until terminal gravity is reached. Allow the yeast to free rise in temperature to promote full attenuation, but don’t let the temperature get above 77 °F (25 °C).

Rack the beer, prime, and bottle condition, or keg and carbonate.

Classic American Porter
by Gordon Strong, Beavercreek, Ohio
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.049 FG = 1.014
IBU = 23 SRM = 30 ABV = 4.7%

This is my take on the lagered porters of the Northeast, in the style of Yuengling. It’s important to not have an overtly roasted flavor; licorice-type flavors are desirable, but not burnt. A less bitter version of this beer without the crystal malt will do nicely as a Dark American Lager. It might work in the Brown Porter category, but entering it as a Specialty Beer would work too.

Ingredients

6.5 lbs. (3 kg) US 2-row pale malt
1.5 lbs. (0.68 kg) US mild malt
1 lb. (0.45 kg) flaked maize
12 oz. (0.34 kg) crystal malt (50 °L)
12 oz. (0.34 kg) Weyermann Carafa® Special II
5 AAU Cluster hops (60 mins.) (0.66 oz./19 g of 7.5% alpha acids)
1.5 AAU Cascade hops (10 mins.) (0.25 oz./7 g of 6% alpha acids)
Wyeast 2206 (Bavarian Lager) yeast (1 qt./1 L yeast starter)
3⁄4 cup corn sugar (for priming)

Step by Step

Two or three days before brew day, make the yeast starter, aerating the wort thoroughly (preferably with oxygen) before pitching the yeast.

On brew day, mash in the malt at 152 °F (67 °C) in 17 qts. (16 L) of water. Hold at this temperature for 60 minutes. Raise mash temperature to 170 °F (77 °C), hold for 5 minutes then recirculate. Run off wort and sparge with water hot enough to keep the grain bed around 170 °F (77 °C). Collect 6.5 gallons (25 L) of wort. (Check that final runnings do not drop below SG 1.010.) Boil wort for 60 minutes, adding hops at times indicated. Ferment at 50 °F (10 °C). Lager at 34 °F (1 °C) for 8 weeks.

Variation: Add some brewer’s licorice or blackstrap molasses (very small amount, perhaps 1 Tb.)

1.5 AAU Cascade hops (10 mins.) (0.25 oz./7 g of 6% alpha acids)
Wyeast 2206 (Bavarian Lager) yeast (1 qt./1 L yeast starter)
3⁄4 cup corn sugar (for priming)

Step by Step

Steep grains in 3 gallons (11 L) of 158 °F (70 °C) water for 30 minutes. Remove grain, add dried malt extract and enough water to make at least 3 gallons (11 L) of wort. Boil wort for 60 minutes, adding hops at times indicated. Keep some boiling water handy and do not let boil volume dip below 3 gallons (11 L). Add liquid malt extract and sugar in the final 15 minutes of the boil. Chill wort, transfer to fermenter and top up to 5 gallons (19 L). Aerate wort and pitch yeast. Ferment at 50 °F (10 °C). Lager at 34 °F (1 °C) for eight weeks.

Tips for Success:
It is important to get good attenuation and a relatively clean profile so be sure to oxygenate the wort and pitch an appropriate amount of clean, healthy yeast. Also, be sure to control the fermentation temperature. Jamil Zainasheff advises that holding the temperature steady is important to getting a proper level of attenuation and avoiding off-flavors. Letting the beer go through large temperature swings can result in the yeast flocculating early or producing solventy and/or overly estery beers. If you experience a temperature swing or two, you can optionally try raising the temperature a few degrees near the end of primary fermentation to help the yeast clean up some of the intermediate compounds produced during fermentation.

Cream Ale
(5 gallons/19 L, extract only)
OG = 1.052 FG = 1.010
IBU = 14 SRM = 3 ABV = 5.6%

Ingredients
5.2 lbs. (2.4 kg) light liquid malt extract
1 lb. (454 g) rice syrup or rice syrup solids (15 min.)
1 lb. (454 g) corn sugar (15 min.)
1.15 AAU Vanguard hops (first wort hop) (0.25 oz./7 g at 4.6% alpha acids)
2.3 AAU Vanguard hops (60 min.) (0.5 oz./14g at 4.6% alpha acids)
0.25 oz. (7 g) Vanguard hops (5 min.)
Wyeast 1056 (American Ale), White Labs WLP001 (California Ale), or SafAle US-05 yeast
3⁄4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Use 6 gallons (23 L) of water in the brew kettle; heat to 158 °F (70 °C).

Turn off the heat. Add the malt extract and stir thoroughly to dissolve completely. You do not want to feel liquid extract at the bottom of the kettle when stirring with your spoon. Turn the heat back on and bring to a boil. Add the first wort hops while raising to a boil.

Boil the wort for 60 minutes, adding hops at the times indicated. Add the sugar and rice syrup/rice syrup solids during the last 15 minutes of the boil.
Chill the wort to 62–64 °F (17–18 °C), pitch the yeast, and ferment until complete. Cool to 32–34 °F (0–1 °C) and lager for four weeks.

Rack the beer, prime and bottle condition, or keg and force carbonate the beer.

Tips For Success:
All-grain brewers can swap out the 2-row pale malt with a quality continental Pilsner malt to build a more bready flavor profile. Flaked rice can be substituted for the sugar in the all-grain recipe as well.

The ale/lager blend found in White Labs WLP080 could make for an interesting substitute in this recipe. A steam beer lager strain would work best with a Chico strain if the White Labs strain is unavailable at your store.

(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.044 FG = 1.013
IBU = 26 SRM = 27 ABV = 4.1%

Ingredients
6 lbs. (2.7 kg) Continental Vienna malt
1.75 lbs. (794 g) Continental dark Munich malt (11 °L)
1.5 lbs. (680 g) Caramunich® III malt (57 °L)
8 oz. (227 g) Carafa® Special II malt (430 °L)
4 AAU Czech Saaz hops (60 min.) (1 oz./28 g at 4% alpha acids)
6 AAU Czech Saaz hops (15 min.) (1.5 oz./43 g at 4% alpha acids)
1.5 oz. (43 g) Czech Saaz hops (1 min.)
White Labs WLP802 (Czech Budejovice Lager), Wyeast 2278 (Czech Pils), or SafLager W-34/70 yeast
3⁄4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
If using a liquid strain, two or three days before brew day, make a 2-qt. (2-L) yeast starter, aerating the wort thoroughly (preferably with oxygen) before pitching the yeast. Use two sachets if using a dry yeast strain.

On brew day, prepare your ingredients: Mill the grain, measure your hops, and prepare your water. This recipe uses reverse osmosis (RO) water. Add 1/4 tsp. 10% phosphoric acid per 5 gallons (19 L) of brewing water, or until water measures pH 5.5 at room temperature. Add 0.5 tsp. calcium chloride (CaCl2) to the mash. Use enough water to have a moderately thick mash (1.5 qts./lb. or 3.1 L/kg).

This recipe uses a step mash program with a mashout. Mash in the Vienna and dark Munich malts at 131 °F (55 °C) and hold for 15 minutes. Raise the mash temperature to 149 °F (65 °C) and rest for 30 minutes. Raise the mash temperature to 158 °F (70 °C) and rest for 30 minutes. Begin recirculating, add the Caramunich® and Carafa® malts, mix gently without disturbing the grain bed, then raise the mash temperature to 170 °F (77 °C) for mashout, recirculating the whole time. Hold at mashout temperature for 15 minutes.

Sparge slowly with 170 °F (77 °C) water until 6.5 gallons (25 L) of wort is collected.

Boil the wort for 60 minutes, adding the hops at times indicated in the recipe. At the end of the boil, let the wort settle for 10 minutes.

Chill the wort to 46 °F (8 °C). Oxygenate the wort, then pitch the yeast starter. Start fermentation at 46 °F (8 °C) but allow the temperature to rise to 50 °F (10 °C) until fermentation is complete. Rack the beer. Lager the beer at 32 °F (0 °C) for 11 weeks, then fine with gelatin or filter.

Prime and bottle condition, or keg and force carbonate to 2.5 volumes. If bottle conditioning, warm condition the beer at 68 °F (20 °C) for one to two weeks before chilling.

Czech Dark Lager
(5 gallons/19 L, extract with grains)
OG = 1.044 FG = 1.013
IBU = 26 SRM = 27 ABV = 4.1%

Ingredients
3.6 lbs. (1.6 kg) Pilsen liquid malt extract
1.4 lbs. (635 g) Munich liquid malt extract
1.5 lbs. (680 g) Caramunich® III malt (57 °L)
8 oz. (227 g) Carafa® Special II malt (430 °L)
4 AAU Czech Saaz hops (60 min.) (1 oz./28 g at 4% alpha acids)
6 AAU Czech Saaz hops (15 min.) (1.5 oz./43 g at 4% alpha acids)
1.5 oz. (43 g) Czech Saaz hops (1 min.)
White Labs WLP802 (Czech Budejovice Lager), Wyeast 2278 (Czech Pils), or SafLager W-34/70 yeast
3⁄4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Start with 6 gallons (23 L) of brewing water in the brew kettle; heat to
158 °F (70 °C).

Steep the Caramunich® and Carafa® malts in a mesh bag for 30 minutes. Remove and rinse grains gently. Turn off heat.

Add the malt extracts and stir thoroughly to dissolve the extract completely. You do not want to feel liquid extract at the bottom of the kettle when stirring with your spoon. Turn the heat back on and bring to a boil. Boil the wort for 60 minutes, adding the hops at the times indicated in the recipe. At the end of the boil, let the wort settle for 10 minutes.

Chill the wort to 46 °F (8 °C). Oxygenate the wort, then pitch the yeast starter. Start fermentation at 46 °F (8 °C) but allow the temperature to rise to 50 °F (10 °C) until fermentation is complete. Rack the beer. Lager the beer at 32 °F (0 °C) for 11 weeks, then fine with gelatin or filter.

Prime and bottle condition, or keg and force carbonate to 2.5 volumes. If bottle conditioning, warm condition the beer at 68 °F (20 °C) for one to two weeks before chilling.

Tips For Success:
While a step mash will help the yeast acheive a full attenuation with this beer, hitting the various temperatures precisely is not crucial. A few degrees off in either direction will not ruin things. Another option is to just slowly heat the mash from 131 °F (55 °C) up to 170 °F (77 °C) over the course of 60–75 minutes to achieve a similar effect.

Yeast health and fermentation temperature control are always two crucial factors when brewing lagers. Make sure to pay close attention to these details in order to produce a clean example of this style of beer. A small addition of yeast nutrients near the end of the boil will often be a good thing as well.

Tips For Success:
While these step by steps provide a general guideline for brewing a quality English barleywine, there are many tweaks that brewers can make to fine-tune the beer to their liking. A longer mash will help with better attenuation rates for the yeast. Collecting more wort in the brew kettle and increasing the boil time will not only boost the brewhouse efficiency of the beer, but can also increase the color and body of the beer as well.

Aging is an aspect that is the brewer’s perogative. Sample how the beer is developing with age to best guide your decisions. Setting aside a small number of bottles to age several years is a fun endeavor!

This recipe uses reverse osmosis (RO) water. Adjust all brewing water to a pH of 5.5 using phosphoric acid. Add 0.5 tsp. of calcium chloride and 0.5 tsp. of gypsum to the mash.

This recipe uses a single infusion mash. Heat 7.5 qts. (7.1 L) of water to about 165 °F (74 °C). Place the crushed Vienna and Munich malts and maize in a large muslin bag and submerge the bag. Stir to make sure no dough balls exist. Rest at 153 °F (67 °C) for 60 minutes. Add the remaining specialty malts in separate bag, raise the temperature to 168 °F (76 °C) if you can without scorching the bags. Remove both bags and place in a large colander. Wash the grains with 2 gallons (7.6 L) of hot water. Add the malt extract and stir thoroughly to dissolve completely. Top off kettle to 6.5 gallons (24.6 L), add the first wort hop, then turn the heat on and bring to a boil.

Boil the wort for 60 minutes, adding hops at the times indicated. Follow the all-grain instruction for fermentation temperature, aging timeframe, and packaging.

(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.054 FG = 1.016
IBU = 24 SRM = 33 ABV = 5.2%

This recipe took first place at the SODZ British Beer Festival, and is fairly straightforward. It is meant to be in the style of Fuller’s London Porter (my personal favorite), with brown malt being the key flavor ingredient. It was entered in the Beer Judge Certification Program (BJCP) Brown Porter category.

Ingredients

7.4 lbs. (3.4 kg) Maris Otter pale ale malt
13 oz. (0.37 kg) German Munich malt
1.25 lbs. (0.57 kg) UK brown malt
1.4 lbs. (0.65 kg) UK crystal (65 °L)
10 oz. (0.28 kg) UK chocolate malt
5.6 AAU Fuggles hops (60 mins.) (1.4 oz./40 g of 4% alpha acids)
2.4 AAU Fuggles hops (10 mins.) (0.6 oz./17 g of 4% alpha acids)
Wyeast 1968 (London ESB Ale) (1 qt./1 L yeast starter)
3⁄4 cup corn sugar (for priming)

Step by Step

Two or three days before brew day, make the yeast starter, aerating the wort thoroughly (preferably with
oxygen) before pitching the yeast.

On brew day, mash in the malt at 153 °F (67 °C) in 17 qts. (16 L) of water. Hold at this temperature for 60 minutes. Raise mash temperature to 170 °F (77 °C), hold for 5 minutes then recirculate. Run off wort and sparge with water hot enough to keep the grain bed around 170 °F (77 °C). Collect 6.5 gallons (25 L) of wort. (Check that final runnings do not drop below SG 1.010.) Boil the wort for 60 minutes, adding hops at times indicated in the ingredients list. Ferment at 66 °F (19 °C).

Steep the grains in 3 gallons (11 L) of 158 °F (70 °C) water for 30 minutes. Remove the grain, add the dried malt extract and enough water to make at least 3 gallons (11 L) of wort. Boil the wort for 60 minutes, adding hops at times indicated in the ingredients list. Keep some boiling water handy and do not let boil volume dip below 3 gallons (11 L). Add the liquid malt extract in the final 15 minutes of the boil. Chill the wort, transfer to fermenter and top up to 5 gallons (19 L). Aerate wort and pitch yeast. Ferment at 66 °F (19 °C).

Tips for Success:
One of the keys to brewing a good porter is paying attention to the brewing water. If you are interested in brewing better beers with dark grains, it’s a good idea to get a water report from your municipal water source, or have a sample of your well or spring analyzed.

Brewing with dark grains adds acidity. If your water contains a low level of carbonates, the pH of the wort and beer can drop when brewing a dark beer, making the beer taste thin and acidic. You can counteract this by adding calcium bicarbonate (chalk) or sodium bicarbonate (baking soda). In the "Practical Porter" story from BYO December 2007, Chris Colby explains how to choose between the two: "Adding chalk adds calcium along with the carbonate, and these two partially offset each other in terms of their effect on pH. If your brewing water is deficient in calcium or you only need to make a small adjustment in mash pH, chalk is a good choice. If you already have enough calcium in your water, or you need to make a relatively large change in pH, baking soda may be a better choice. (Note: do not use baking soda that has been used previously to absorb odors from your refrigerator.)"

5.5 AAU Magnum hops (60 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 11% alpha acids)
1.6 AAU Hallertauer hops (15 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 3.2% alpha acids)
0.5 oz. (14 g) Hallertauer hops (0 min.)
White Labs WLP833 (German Bock) or Saflager W34/70 yeast
3⁄4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
This recipe uses reverse osmosis (RO) water. Adjust all brewing water to a pH of 5.5 using phosphoric acid. Dissolve 1 tsp. of calcium chloride to the mash.

Mash in all malts at 131 °F (55 °C) and rest for 10 minutes. Raise mash temperature to 145 °F (63 °C) by direct heat or infusion with boiling water and rest for 15 minutes. Pull a thick decoction, raise the decoction to 158 °F (70 °C) for 20 minutes, raise to boil, boil for 10 minutes, remix and hit 158 °F (70 °C). The combined mash should now be at 158 °F (70 °C), allow to rest for 30 minutes. Pull a thin decoction, bring to a boil for 10 minutes, then remix to hit 170 °F (77 °C). Rest at mashout temperature for 15 minutes while recirculating. Fly sparge with 170 °F (77 °C) water, collecting 6.5 gallons (25 L) of wort. Add the first wort hops to the kettle during sparge. Boil the wort for 90 minutes, adding hops at the times indicated in the recipe.

After the boil, chill the wort to 48 °F (9 °C), pitch the yeast, allowing temperature to rise to 50–52 °F (10–11 °C), and ferment until complete. Rack and lager for 16 weeks at 32 °F (0 °C). Fine the beer with gelatin if necessary, allow to drop bright, then rack. Prime and bottle condition, or keg and force carbonate.

Gordon Strong's Munich Dunkel
Munich Dunkel
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.049 FG = 1.012
IBU = 21 SRM = 20 ABV = 4.9%

Ingredients
10 lbs. (4.5 kg) Weyermann dark Munich malt (9 °L)
4 oz. (113 g) melanoidin malt
4 oz. (113 g) Weyermann Carafa® II Special malt
5.5 AAU Tettnanger hops (60 min.) (1.25 oz/28 g at 4.4% alpha acid)
White Labs WLP833 (German Bock Lager), Wyeast 2487 (Hella Bock Lager) or Mangrove Jack’s M76 (Bavarian Lager) yeast
3⁄4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
This recipe uses reverse osmosis (RO) water. Adjust all brewing water to a pH of 5.5 using phosphoric acid. Add 1 tsp. of calcium chloride to the mash.

Step mash: Mash in Munich malt at 131 °F (55 °C) and rest for 10 minutes. Increase to 146 °F (63 °C) using direct heat or hot-water infusion and hold for 40 minutes.
Increase to 158 °F (70 °C) using direct heat or hot-water infusion and hold for 30 minutes. Add Carafa® and melanoidin malts on to the top of the mash and raise to 168 °F
(76 °C), then hold for 15 minutes while recirculating the wort. Fly sparge with 170 °F (77 °C) water, collecting 6.5 gallons (25 L) of wort.

Boil the wort for 90 minutes, adding hops at the times indicated in the recipe. A kettle fining can be added but a proper lagering should sufficiently clear the beer.

Chill the wort to 50 °F (10 °C), pitch the yeast, and ferment at this temperature until complete. Lager the beer at 32 °F (0 °C) for six weeks. Rack and package the beer, or rack and clarify the beer, if desired, with finings before packaging (prime and bottle condition, or keg and force carbonate).

Alesmith Brewing Co.’s Evil Dead Red clone
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.069 FG = 1.018
IBU = 10 SRM = 18 ABV = 6.66%

Evil Dead Red was one of the most innovative beers to come out of California in the early 2000s. It utilizes a hop burst technique to provide tons of aromatics thanks to ample American hops added late in the boil without a true bittering hop charge. This beer remains AleSmith Brewing Co.’s annual Halloween beer.

Ingredients
12 lbs. (5.5 kg) 2-row pale malt
1.6 lbs. (0.7 kg) Munich malt (10 °L)
12 oz. (350 g) English light crystal malt (45 °L)
9.7 oz. (275 g) English crystal malt (77 °L)
3.5 oz. (100 g) English extra dark crystal malt (120 °L)
1.8 oz. (50 g) roasted barley (550 °L)
0.9 AAU Chinook hops (60 min.) (0.075 oz./2 g at 12% alpha acids)
4 AAU Chinook (10 min.) (0.25 oz./7 g at 12% alpha acids)
3.5 AAU Columbus hops (10 min.) (0.25 oz./7 g at 14% alpha acids)
2.5 oz. (71 g) Cascade hops (hopstand)
1 oz. (28 g) Chinook hops (hopstand)
1 oz. (28 g) Columbus hops (hopstand)
1.5 oz. (43 g) Cascade hops (dry hop)
1 oz. (28 g) Chinook hops (dry hop)
1 oz. (28 g) Columbus hops (dry hop)
Wyeast 1056 (American Ale) or White Labs WLP001 (California Ale) or Safale US-05 yeast
3⁄4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Mill the grains and mix with 5 gallons (19 L) of strike water at 168 °F (76 °C) to reach a mash temperature of 156 °F (69 °C). Hold this temperature for 45 minutes. Vorlauf until your runnings are clear. Sparge with enough water to obtain 7 gallons (25 L) of wort. Add a pinch of hops near the beginning of the boil, mainly for foam control. Total boil time is 60 minutes. Add hops as indicated. After the boil, chill wort to 175 °F (80 °C) then begin a whirlpool of the wort and add the hopstand hops. Let settle for 30 minutes, then chill the wort to 66 °F (19 °C). The aim is to have 5.25 gallons (20 L) of wort in your fermenter. Aerate with pure oxygen or filtered air and pitch yeast.

Ferment at 68 °F (20 °C) for 7 days. Chill to 60 °F (16 °C) and wait 7 days. You can then cold-crash the beer prior to packaging to 35 °F (2 °C) for 48 hours to improve clarity. Carbonate to ~2.5 volumes.

Step by Step
Heat 5 gallons (19 L) of water to 158 °F (70 °C) and remove from heat. Place the crushed grains in a grain bag and soak in the water for 30 minutes. Remove grain bag, allowing liquid to drip back into the pot. Stir in all the dried malt extract and bring to a boil. Follow the remainder of the all-grain recipe.

Backstory
In my conversation with Peter Zien, the CEO/Owner of AleSmith, he mentioned that the recipe was actually the brainchild of Tod Fitzsimmons who has worked at AleSmith for 22 of the 23 years in which AleSmith has been in operation. Back then, Tod was the president of QUAFF homebrew club and Peter was the vice-president of the club. Tod created a beer he dubbed I Thee Wed Red for his wedding celebration back in 1997. Demand for the beer went through the roof after its release. Evil Dead Red is a blood-red beer and according to Peter, "The ABV must be 6.66%!"

Gordon Strong's Roggenbier
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.050 FG = 1.012
IBU = 18 SRM = 17 ABV = 5%

Ingredients
7 lbs. (3.2 kg) German rye malt
2.5 lbs. (1.13 kg) Vienna malt
2.5 lbs. (1.13 kg) caramel wheat malt (50 °L)
2 oz. (57 g) Carafa® Special II malt
1 lb. (454 g) rice hulls
4 AAU Perle hops (60 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 8% alpha acids)
4 AAU Perle hops (5 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 8% alpha acids)
Wyeast 3068 (Weihenstephan Weizen), White Labs WLP300 (Hefeweizen Ale), or SafAle WB-06 yeast
7⁄8 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
This recipe uses reverse osmosis (RO) water. Add 1 tsp. of calcium chloride to the mash. This recipe uses a double decoction mash. Use enough water to have a moderately thick mash, 1.5 qts./lb. (3.1 L/kg). Stir the decoctions frequently to avoid scorching the grain.

Mash in the rye, Vienna, and wheat malts at 95 °F (35 °C); hold the mash at this temperature for 10 minutes. Pull the first thick decoction (about 1⁄3 of the mash), bring to a boil (resting for 10 minutes at 122 °F/50 °C and 10 minutes at 158 °F/70 °C; boil for 10 minutes); leave the main mash at 95 °F (35 °C) during this process. Remix the mashes to hit 122 °F (50 °C). Pull the second thick decoction (again, about 1⁄3 of the mash), heat to 147 °F (64 °C) for 20 minutes, boil for 10 minutes, leaving the main mash at 122 °F (50 °C) during this process. Remix the mashes to hit 158 °F (70 °C). Add the rice hulls, mixing fully, then rest for 15 minutes.

Add the Carafa® malt. Begin recirculating slowly and raise temperature to 168 °F (76 °C) and recirculate for 15 minutes. Sparge very slowly and collect 6.5 gallons (24.5 L) of wort. Cutting the mash bed in a tight crosshatch pattern will encourage runoff. Boil the wort for 90 minutes, adding hops at the times indicated in the recipe.

Chill the wort to 59 °F (15 °C), pitch the yeast, and ferment until complete, allowing the temperature to rise to no more than 64 °F (18 °C) during fermentation. Rack the beer, prime and bottle condition, or keg and force carbonate.

Roggenbier
(5 gallons/19 L, extract with grains)
OG = 1.050 FG = 1.012
IBU = 18 SRM = 17 ABV = 5%

Ingredients
6.6 lbs. (3 kg) rye liquid malt extract
2 oz. (57 g) Carafa® Special II malt
4 AAU Perle hops (60 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 8% alpha acids)
4 AAU Perle hops (5 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 8% alpha acids)
Wyeast 3068 (Weihenstephan Weizen), White Labs WLP300 (Hefeweizen Ale), or SafAle WB-06 yeast
7⁄8 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
This recipe is not the same as the all-grain recipe; the available rye extracts I have found tend to have between 20–25% rye, which is a half to a third as much as needed for a roggenbier. But it will be easier to use, and have some rye flavor. The rye extracts all seem to have some level of rye, crystal, and base malt so that can be used as a substitute for the grains except the coloring malt.

Add the Carafa® malt in a mesh bag and steep in 6.5 gallons (24.5 L) of water in the brew kettle as it heats to 158 °F (70 °C). Remove and rinse grains gently. Turn off the heat and add the malt extract and stir thoroughly to dissolve completely. Turn the heat back on and bring to a boil. Boil the wort for 60 minutes, adding hops at the times indicated.

Chill the wort to 59 °F (15 °C), pitch the yeast, and ferment until complete, allowing the temperature to rise to no more than 64 °F (18 °C) during fermentation. Rack the beer, prime and bottle condition, or keg and force carbonate.

Gordon Strong's Sahti
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.099 FG = 1.038
IBU = 9 SRM = 16 ABV = 9%

Ingredients
15.5 lbs. (7 kg) Pilsner malt
2 lbs. (0.91 kg) dark Munich malt
2 lbs. (0.91 kg) rye malt
1.25 lbs. (567 g) caramel rye malt (65 °L)
1 lb. (454 g) rice hulls
4 AAU Spalt hops (mash hop) (1 oz./28 g at 4% alpha acids)
1–2 small Juniperus communis branches to cover the mash tun
LalBrew Munich Classic, SafAle
WB-06, or a favorite kveik yeast of your choice.

Step by Step
This recipe uses reverse osmosis (RO) water. Adjust all brewing water to a pH of 5.5 using phosphoric acid. Add 1 tsp. of calcium chloride at the beginning of the mash.

This recipe uses a long, multi-step infusion mash, but no boil. The wort is not concentrated by boiling so think of this as a first-runnings beer. Mash in the grains with the rice hulls at 113 °F (45 °C) using 1.2 qts./lb. (2.5 L/kg) of water. Add the hops then hold for 30 minutes. Raise the temperature to 122 °F (50 °C) and hold for 30 minutes. Raise the temperature to 131 °F (55 °C) and hold for 30 minutes. Raise the temperature to 140 °F (60 °C) and hold for 30 minutes. Raise the temperature to 149 °F (65 °C) and hold for 30 minutes. Raise the temperature to 158 °F (70 °C) and hold for 30 minutes. Add the juniper to the mash. Raise the temperature to 167 °F (75 °C) and hold for 30 minutes. Raise the temperature to 185 °F (85 °C) and hold for 30 minutes.

Run off the wort slowly into the fermenter until you have collected 5 gallons (19 L). You many need to sparge lightly if necessary to reach this volume. Brew-in-a-bag users may have an advantage since they can wring out the wort from the grains as well. Using a larger fermenter is advisable since the fermentation can be vigorous.

Chill to 50 °F (10°C) and pitch the yeast. Allow the temperature to rise to room temperature as the fermentation gets going. When fermentation starts to slow, rack the beer gently to secondary and move to a colder location, 50 °F (10 °C) or below. Condition for one week. Try to avoid removing carbonation from the beer during transfers.

Keg without additional carbonation, or package in plastic soda bottles. Do not prime. Since the beer is biologically unstable, you will want to store below 40 °F (5 °C) and preferably consume within two weeks.

An extract recipe is not possible due to the unusual brewing technique of sahti and the fact that much of the character of the beer comes from the wort production.

Tips For Success:
While sahti is beer produced from the first runnings from the kuurna, or lauter tun, the remaining sugars would not be wasted. Traditionally a second runnings beer would be fermented to produce a table beer or "ladies sahti." If you have the fermentation space, it seems prudent to collect these sugars and make one yourself as there will be plenty of sugars remaining in the mash.

If you cannot source fresh, green juniper branches, then you can substitute in juniper berries as well, which will provide more of a black-pepper kick compared to the pine needle-like branches. According to Mika Laitinen, adding 0.18 oz. (5 g) berries per 5 gallons (19 L) of beer directly to the fermenter (like dry hops) is a good starting point. He also adds that: "A fine sahti can be made without any juniper and it is often perceived in sahti even when not actually used, the baker’s yeast can give a similar spicy twist."

Tips For Success:
You really don’t want any sharp edges, so resist the urge to make this style of beer too hoppy, bitter, or boozy. When it comes to fermentation, you don’t want fruitiness or rough edges from a hasty fermentation and lagering. Slow and low is the goal to produce the elegance this beer deserves.

Gordon Strong's Weissbier
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.050 FG = 1.010
IBU = 12 SRM = 3 ABV = 5.3%

Ingredients
6.25 lbs. (2.8 kg) German wheat malt
4 lbs. (1.8 kg) German Pilsner malt
1 lb. (0.45 kg) rice hulls
3.1 AAU Sterling hops (60 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 6.2% alpha acids)
Wyeast 3068 (Weihenstephan Weizen) or White Labs WLP300 (Hefeweizen Ale) or Mangrove Jack’s M20 (Bavarian Wheat) yeast
7⁄8 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
No starter is required. This recipe uses reverse osmosis (RO) water. Adjust all brewing water to a pH of 5.5 using phosphoric or lactic acid. Add 1 tsp. of calcium chloride to the mash.

This is a combined step and single decoction mash: Mash in both grains at 113 °F (45 °C) in 15 qts. (14 L) water. Hold at this ferulic acid rest temperature for 15 minutes, then raise the temperature to 131 °F (55 °C) for a protein rest. Maintain at this temperature for 10 minutes.

Pull a thick decoction (33–40% of mash with minimal liquid) and heat the decocted portion to 158 °F (70 °C) for 20 minutes, then boil gently for 10 minutes, stirring constantly. Meanwhile (during the decoction), heat the main mash to 147 °F (64 °C) and hold. Recombine the two mashes and rice hulls to hit 158 °F (70 °C) . Rest for 10 minutes. Raise the mash temperature to 168 °F (76 °C) for mashout. Recirculate for 15 minutes.

Sparge slowly and collect 6.5 gallons (24.5 L) of wort. Boil the wort for 90 minutes, adding hops at the time indicated in the recipe.

Chill the wort to 57 °F (14 °C), pitch the yeast, and ferment until complete at 62 °F (17 °C). Rack the beer, prime, and bottle (or cask) condition, or keg and force carbonate.

Weissbier
(5 gallons/19 L, extract only)
OG = 1.050 FG = 1.010
IBU = 12 SRM = 3 ABV = 5.3%

Ingredients
5.5 lbs. (2.5 kg) Bavarian wheat dried malt extract
3.1 AAU Sterling hops (60 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 6.2% alpha acids)
Wyeast 3068 (Weihenstephan Weizen) or White Labs WLP300 (Hefeweizen Ale) or Mangrove Jack’s M20 (Bavarian Wheat) yeast
7⁄8 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Use 6.5 gallons (24.5 L) of low mineral or RO water in the brew kettle; heat to 158 °F (70 °C).

Turn off the heat. Add the malt extract and stir thoroughly to dissolve completely. Turn the heat back on and bring to a boil. Boil the wort for 60 minutes, adding hops at the time indicated.

Chill the wort to 57 °C (14 °F), pitch the yeast, and ferment until complete at 62 °F (17 °C). Rack the beer, prime and bottle (or cask) condition, or keg and
force carbonate.

Tips For Success:
Decoction mashing is not an essential part of this recipe, but should help develop the proper mouthfeel. If time is short on brew day, you can just do the ferulic acid rest and a single saccharification rest at about 152 °F (67 °F).

If this is your first time attempting a decoction mash, a good tool to pull the grains out of the mash tun is a stainless steel colander (and gloves). This will help drain most of liquid back into the main mash. You want a little liquid with the grains, but not too much. By the end of the boil, there should be some Maillard reactions occuring in the decoction pot, but the grains should never scorch.

Gordon Strong's Witbier
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.050 FG = 1.011
IBU = 12 SRM = 3.5 ABV = 5.1%

Ingredients
5.5 lbs. (2.5 kg) German Pilsner malt
5 lbs. (2.3 kg) flaked wheat
8 oz. (227 g) flaked oats
3.1 AAU Sterling hops (60 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 6.2% alpha acids)
0.5 oz. (14 g) coriander seed, crushed
0.25 oz. (7 g) Curaçao orange peel
1.8 g chamomile flowers, dried
Wyeast 3944 (Belgian Witbier), White Labs WLP400 (Belgian Wit), or SafAle T-58 yeast
7⁄8 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
This recipe uses reverse osmosis (RO) water. Adjust all brewing water to a pH of 5.5 using phosphoric acid. Add 1 tsp. of calcium chloride (CaCl2) to the mash.

This recipe calls for a step mash process. Start by mashing in the grains at 122 °F (50 °C) using a 1.5 qts./lb. (3.1 L/kg) water-to-grist ratio. Hold at this temperature for 15 minutes. Through either infusion with boiling water or with a recirculating mash system, raise the temperature to 148 °F (64 °C). Rest at that temperature for 45 minutes, or until saccharification is complete.

Sparge slowly and collect 6.5 gallons (24.5 L) of wort. If lautering is difficult, adding a pound (0.45 kg) of rice hulls can help.

Boil the wort for 90 minutes, adding the single hop addition 30 minutes after the start of the boil. Put all three of the spices in a tight mesh bag and add when boil is complete, stirring; remove after five minutes.

Chill the wort down to 64 °F (18 °C), pitch the yeast, and ferment until complete. After a short conditioning, rack the beer, prime and bottle condition, or keg and force carbonate.

Step by Step
Start with 6.5 gallons (24.5 L) of water in the brew kettle; heat water to 158 °F (70 °C).

Turn off the heat. Add the malt extract and stir thoroughly to dissolve completely. Turn the heat back on and bring to a boil.

Boil the wort for 60 minutes, adding hops at the time indicated. Put the spices in a tight mesh bag and add when boil is complete, stirring; remove after 5 minutes.

Chill the wort down to 64 °F (18 °C), pitch the yeast, and ferment until complete. After a short conditioning, rack the beer, prime and bottle condition, or keg and force carbonate.

Tips for Success:
This is one of those styles that is hard to duplicate the pillowy mouthfeel that the flaked wheat and oats provide by substituting with extracts. With the advent of the brew-in-a-bag systems, this is the perfect brew to give that type of system a try if you don’t currently brew all-grain. Just take it slow and steady through the temperature step and don’t worry if the resting temperatures are off some. We’re sure you’ll still be happy with the results. And be sure to use fresh spices.

9 oz. (0.26 kg) Weyermann Carafa® III malt (525 °L)
9 oz. (0.26 kg) chocolate malt (350 °L)
9 oz. (0.26 kg) roasted barley (300 °L)
9 oz. (0.26 kg) Special B malt (135 °L)
2.4 lbs. (1.1 kg) Muntons extra light dried malt extract (3 °L)
20.7 AAU Galena hops (60 min.) (1.8 oz./51 g at 11.5% alpha acid)
19 AAU Simcoe® hops (10 min.) (1.5 oz./42 g at 12.7% alpha acid)
Whirlfloc (15 min.)
Yeast nutrient (15 min.)
White Labs WLP007 (Dry English Ale) yeast (1.5 L/1.6 qt. yeast starter)
White Labs WLP099 (Super High Gravity Ale) yeast (1L/1 qt. yeast starter)
¾ Cup corn sugar (for priming)

Step by Step
One week before brew day, get a WLP007 yeast starter going. When starter activity slows, decant the spent wort and add fresh wort.On brew day, mill the grains and dough-in with 28 quarts (26.5 L) hot water, targeting a mash at 154 °F (68 °C). Hold until enzymatic conversion is complete. If your system allows, raise the mash temperature to 168 °F (76 °C) and recirculate the wort until clear. Sparge with 170 °F (77 °C) water to collect 6.5 gallons (25 L) of wort. Take a specific gravity reading and add the dried malt extract until the specific gravity is 1.088. Boil for 90 minutes, adding the Galena and Simcoe® hops at 60 and 10 minutes respectively. Add Whirlfloc and yeast nutrient with 15 minutes remaining in boil. Chill the wort to 70 °F (21 °C), aerate, and add WLP007 starter (decanting the spent wort first). When fermentation slows, take a gravity reading and add the WLP099 starter (if needed) to achieve a final specific gravity of 1.035. Keg or bottle carbonate, aiming for a carbonation level of 2.0–2.2 volumes of CO2. Once carbonated, condition at cellar temperature for several months. Flavor should peak at about one year and remain there for at least another year.

White Labs WLP099 (Super High Gravity Ale) yeast (1L/1 qt. yeast starter)
3⁄4 Cup corn sugar (for priming)

Step by Step
One week before brew day, get a WLP007 yeast starter going. When starter activity slows, decant the spent wort and add fresh wort.On brew day, crush the grains and place in two steeping bags. Steep the bags at 155 °F (68 °C) in 16 quarts (15 L) of water for 20 minutes. Rinse the grains with 2 quarts (2 L) of 170 °F (77 °C) hot water. Add dried malt extract (DME) and table sugar. Boil for 60 minutes, adding the hops at the specified times. Chill the wort to
70 °F (21 °C) and add water to achieve 5 gallons (19 L) of wort. Aerate the wort and add WLP007 starter (decanting the spent wort first). When fermentation slows, take a gravity reading and add WLP099 starter (if needed) to achieve a final specific gravity of 1.035. Keg or bottle carbonate, aiming for a carbonation level of 2.0–2.2 volumes of CO2. Once carbonated, condition at cellar temperature for several months. Flavor should peak at about one year and remain there for at least another year.

Tips for Success:
Pitching plenty of healthy yeast is paramount for a high gravity brew. When in doubt, pitch more. Be patient with the fermentation and conditioning process. Beer doesn't have a schedule. For bottle carbonation, pitch fresh yeast at bottling time if the WLP099 wasn't needed during the brew day. Give the bottles adequate time to carbonate. This beer needs to age, anyway. You'll thank me later for saving it until its peak. If you would like, try aging this beer in a bourbon barrel. How long to barrel condition is a matter of individual taste. Our club likes a full bourbon flavor, so we age the beer for several months. We don't worry about temperature. The barrel's alive, and varying temperatures allow the wood to expand and contract, imparting those wonderful oak and bourbon flavors.

Expect 5 gallons (19 L) at the end of boil. Cool to 55 °F (13 °C), transfer to your fermenter, aerate and pitch yeast starter. Ferment 10–14 days at 55 °F (13 °C) then let the temperature increase to 60 °F (16 °C) for three days. Rack it off of the yeast into a keg to finish lagering for 4-6 weeks.

Extract with grains option:
Reduce the pale malt and Munich malt to 9 oz. (255 g) each. Add 4.5 lbs. light liquid malt extract and 4.5 lbs. Weyermann's Munich liquid malt extract. Steep crushed grains in 3 qts. (2.8 L) of water at 150 °F (66 °C) for 45 minutes. Combine "grain tea," Munich liquid malt extract and water to make 3.0 gallons (11 L) of wort. Boil 60 minutes, adding hops at times indicated in the all-grain recipe and pale liquid malt extract for final 15 minutes of boil. Cool, transfer to fermenter and top up to 5 gallons (19 L). Pitch yeast. Ferment, at 70 °F (21 °C).

(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.036 FG = 1.009
IBU = 22 SRM = 20 ABV = 3.5%

Ingredients
5.8 lbs. (2.6 kg) Maris Otter pale malt
0.5 lbs. (0.23 kg) crystal malt (60 °L)
6 oz. (0.17 kg) crystal malt (80 °L)
6 oz. (0.17 kg) crystal malt (120 °L)
3 oz. (85 g) chocolate rye malt (250 °L)
3 oz. (85 g) chocolate malt (450 °L)
5 AAU East Kent Goldings hops (60 min.) (1 oz./28 g at 5% alpha acids)
Wyeast Labs 1028 (London Ale) or White Labs WLP013 (London Ale) yeast
3⁄4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Mill the grains and mix with 2.3 gallons (8.8 L) of 160 °F (71 °C) strike water to reach a mash temperature of 148 °F (64 °C). Hold this temperature for 60 minutes. Vorlauf until your runnings are clear and lauter. Sparge the grains with 4.9 gallons (18.5 L) water and top up as necessary to obtain 6 gallons (23 L) of wort. Boil for 60 minutes, adding hops according to the ingredient list. After the boil, turn off heat and chill the wort to slightly below fermentation temperature, about 65 °F (18 °C). Aerate the wort with pure oxygen or filtered air and pitch the yeast.

Ferment at 66 °F (19 °C) for seven days. Raise to 72 °F (22 °C) for seven more days. Once the beer reaches terminal gravity, bottle or keg the beer and carbonate to approximately 2.5 volumes. You may want to cold-crash the beer prior to packaging at 35 °F (2 °C) for 48 hours to improve clarity.

Grantham Mild
(5 gallons/19 L, extract with grains)
OG = 1.037 FG = 1.010
IBU = 22 SRM = 20 ABV = 3.5%

Ingredients
4.2 lbs. (1.9 kg) Maris Otter liquid malt extract
0.5 lbs. (0.23 kg) crystal malt (60 °L)
6 oz. (0.17 kg) crystal malt (80 °L)
6 oz. (0.17 kg) crystal malt (120 °L)
3 oz. (85 g) chocolate rye malt (250 °L)
3 oz. (85 g) chocolate malt (450 °L)
5 AAU East Kent Goldings hops (60 min.) (1 oz./28 g at 5% alpha acids)
Wyeast Labs 1028 (London Ale) or White Labs WLP013 (London Ale) yeast
3⁄4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Bring 5.6 gallons (21.2 L) of water to 162 °F (72 °C) and hold there, and steep milled specialty grains in grain bags for 15 minutes. Remove the grain bags, and let drain fully. Add liquid extract while stirring, and stir until completely dissolved. Bring the wort to a boil. Boil for 60 minutes, adding hops according to the ingredient list. After the boil, turn off heat and chill the wort to slightly below fermentation temperature, about 65 °F (18 °C). Aerate the wort with pure oxygen or filtered air and pitch yeast.

Ferment at 66 °F (19 °C) for seven days. Raise to 72 °F (22 °C) for seven more days. Once the beer reaches terminal gravity, bottle or keg the beer and carbonate to approximately 2.5 volumes. You may want to cold-crash the beer prior to packaging at 35 °F (2 °C) for 48 hours to improve clarity.

Tips for Success:
Don’t be afraid of the low mash temperature here. The presence of so many crystal malts will add plenty of body and character to your beer, and a highly fermentable wort will mean that the beer keeps its "drinkable" status. If you find this one too darkly malty for your taste you can go one or two steps lighter on the crystals’ Lovibonds (20 or 40 for the Crystal 60, 60 for the 80, etc.), maybe add in some interesting light character malts (Victory®, biscuit) and swap in some pale chocolate or dehusked malts for the chocolate malts to keep it from going too malty/roasty. And if you have access to them, definitely make use of British crystal malts (light, medium, dark). The Lovibond numbers won’t match exactly, but that’s fine — it might just be in my head, but I find the beer tastes a bit more authentic when you use native ingredients.

Ingredients
15.25 lbs (6.9 kg) American 2-row malt
1.0 lb (0.45 kg) crystal malt (120 °L)
12 oz. (0.34 kg) chocolate malt
12 oz. (0.34 kg) black patent malt
10 oz. (0.28 kg) roasted barley
8.0 oz. (0.23 kg) flaked wheat
8.0 oz. (0.23 kg) flaked rye
14.3 AAU Chinook hops (60 min.) (1.1 oz./31 g of 13% alpha acids)
7.2 AAU Chinook hops (30 min.) (0.55 oz./16 g of 13% alpha acids)
5.3 AAU Centennial hops (15 min.) (0.50 oz./14 g of 10.5% alpha acids)
0.5 oz. (14 g) Centennial hops (5 min.)
Wyeast 1056 (American Ale) or White Labs WLP001 (California Ale) yeast (3 qt./~3 L yeast starter)
0.75 cups corn sugar (for priming)

Step by Step
Mash at 150 °F (66 °C). Boil for 60 minutes, adding hops as indicated above. Ferment at 70 °F (21 °C).

Partial Mash Option
Reduce the amount of 2-row pale malt to 2.0 lbs. (0.91 kg). Add 9.0 lbs. (4.1 kg) of Mun-tons Light liquid malt extract to the recipe. Heat 2.3 gallons (8.7 L) of water to 161 °F (72 °C). Submerge grain bag(s) and partial mash at 150 °F (66 °C) for 30–45 minutes. (Note: this is just over 6 lbs. (~ 3 kg) of grains, you may need more than one grain bag, depending on size. Putting your brewpot in your oven on its lowest heat setting may help you maintain partial mash temperature.)

Remove grains, rinse grain bag(s) slowly with 1.0 gallon (3.8 L) of water at 170 °F (77 °C). Add water to brewpot to make 4.0 gallons (15 L) of wort; stir in roughly two-thirds of the malt extract. Bring to a boil. Boil for 60 minutes, adding hops at the times indicated in the ingredient list. Add remaining malt extract with 15 minutes left in boil. Cool wort, transfer to fermenter, top up to 5

(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.096 FG = 1.026
IBU = 90 SRM = 11 ABV = 10.2%

Old Ruffian is a hefty, hop-forward barleywine with subtle fruit aromas and complex caramel sweetness.

Ingredients
19 lbs. (8.6 kg) American 2-row pale malt
0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) crystal malt (75 °L)
0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) Victory® malt
0.25 lb. (0.11 kg) flaked wheat
36 AAU Chinook hops (60 min.) (3 oz./85 g at 12% alpha acids)
16 AAU Amarillo® hops (30 min.) (2 oz./57 g at 8% alpha acids)
24 AAU Amarillo® hops (5 min.) (3 oz./85 g at 8% alpha acids)
White Labs WLP051 (California V Ale) or Wyeast 1272 (American II Ale) yeast (5 quarts/~5 L yeast starter)
2/3 cup (133 g) dextrose (if priming)

Step by Step
This is a very big beer. See below for two options for generating your wort. In all cases, use a single infusion mash (or steep) at 154 °F (68 °C), held for 45–60 minutes. Add hops as indicated in the ingredient list. Pitch the yeast from your yeast starter, aerate very well and hold fermentation temperature at 66 °F (19 °C). Keg or bottle the beer when fermentation is complete and beer has fallen clear. Alternatively, you could try bourbon barrel aging this beer as Great Divide does, or by adding toasted oak cubes or staves that have been soaked in bourbon. Be sure to taste samples regularly to observe the level of bourbon and oak flavors over time in the beer so they do not overwhelm the nuances of your Old Ruffian clone.

Long boil option:Mash grains listed in ingredient list with 28 quarts (26 L) of mash liquor. After mash, recirculate wort until clear. Collect wort until the specific gravity of the final runnings falls below 1.010. (This may be up to 12 gallons (45 L), depending on a number of variables.) Keep your sparge water heated such that your grain bed temperature creeps up to 168 °F (76 °C) near the end of wort collection. Boil wort to reduce volume to 6 gallons (23 L). Add first dose of hops and boil them for an hour, aiming for 5 gallons (19 L) of post-boil wort.

First wort option: Add enough pale malt to your mash tun so that you can run off 6 gallons (23 L) of first wort without adding sparge water. For this you will need between 26.75 lbs. to 32.5 lbs. (12-15 kg) of pale malt (in addition to the specialty malts and flaked wheat), depending on how much water your grains normally absorb. You will need roughly 9–10 gallons (34–38 L) of mash liquor (and 12–14 gallons/45–53 L of mash tun space to hold it all). Your 6 gallons (23 L) of pre-boil wort should have a specific gravity of 1.085–1.090. Boil for one hour to reduce wort to a volume of 5 gallons (19 L). Note: You can (and should) sparge the grain bed to collect wort for a second beer.]

Partial mash option: Substitute 17 lbs. (7.7 kg) of the 2-row pale malt in the all-grain recipe with 9 lbs. (4.1 kg) of extra light dried malt extract. Steep the crushed 2-row and specialty grains in 1 gallon (4 L) water at 154 °F (68 °C) for 60 minutes. Remove the grain bag and place in a colander. Slowly rinse the grains with 1 gallon (4 L) hot water. Top off the kettle to 6 gallons (23 L) and stir in the dried malt extract while off of heat. Be sure all the extract is dissolved, then bring the wort to a boil. Follow the remaining all-grain instructions.

8 oz. (0.22 kg) roasted barley (450 °L)
6.75 AAU Northern Brewer pellet hops (60 min.) (0.75 oz./21 g at 9% alpha acids)
2.4 AAU Fuggle pellet hops (30 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 4.75% alpha acids)
2.9 AAU Cascade pellet hops (0 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 5.75% alpha acids)
1⁄2 tsp. yeast nutrient (15 min.)
White Labs WLP 013 (London Ale) or Wyeast 1028 (London Ale) yeast
3⁄4 cup (150 g) dextrose (if priming)

Step by Step
Mix the crushed grains with 3.75 gallons (14 L) of 170 °F (77 °C) water to stabilize at 155 °F (68 °C) for 60 minutes. Sparge slowly with 175 °F (79 °C) water. Collect approximately 6 gallons (23 L) of wort runoff to boil for 60 minutes. Add the hops as indicated. After the boil, cool the wort to 75 °F (24 °C). Pitch your yeast and aerate the wort heavily. Allow the beer to cool to 68 °F (20 °C). Hold at that temperature until fermentation is complete. Transfer to a carboy, avoiding any splashing. Condition for one week and then bottle or keg. Allow the beer to carbonate and age for two weeks.

Extract with grains option: Substitute the 2-row pale malt in the all-grain recipe with 6.6 lbs. (3 kg) Coopers light, unhopped, malt extract and 1.1 lbs. (0.49 kg) light dried malt extract. Steep the crushed grains in 1.5 gallons (5.6 L) of water at 155 °F (68 °C) for 30 minutes. Remove grains from the wort and rinse with 2 quarts (1.8 L) of hot water. Add the liquid and dried malt extracts and bring to a boil. While boiling, add the hops, yeast nutrient as per the schedule. Now add the wort to 2 gallons (7.6 L) of cold water in a sanitized fermenter and top off with cold water up to 5 gallons (19 L). Follow the remaining portion of the all-grain recipe.

By Cleveland tradition, the annual release of Christmas Ale effectively marks the official start of the holiday season in The Forest City.

Ingredients
10.5 lbs. (4.76 kg) American Pilsner malt
1 lb. (0.45 kg) crystal malt (45 °L)
1 lb. (0.45 kg) unmalted white wheat
0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) Briess Special Roast (50 °L) malt
0.25 lb. (0.11 kg) roasted barley
1 lb. (0.45 kg) honey (0 min.)
4.9 AAU Mt. Hood hops (60 min.) (0.75 oz./21 g at 6.5% alpha acids)
3.25 AAU Mt. Hood hops (30 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 6.5% alpha acids)
5.75 AAU Cascade hops (5 min.) (1 oz./28 g at 5.75% alpha acids)
0.05 oz. (1.4 g) fresh cut ginger root (crushed or finely cut) (0 min.)
0.05 oz. (1.4 g) cinnamon stick (0 min.)
Wyeast 1098 (British Ale) or White Labs WLP007 (English Dry Ale) or LalBrew Nottingham yeast
3⁄4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Using a 1.2 qts. to lbs. grist ratio, start the mash at 150 °F (66 °C) for at least 30 minutes to ensure beta amylase conversion. Once fully converted, increase temperature to 160 °F (71 °C) for 15 minutes to encourage alpha amylase conversion, before raising it once again to 170 °F (77 °C) for 2 minutes to end conversion. Recirculate at least 10 minutes or until clear, then sparge using water at 170 °F (77 °C) water until you collect 6.5 gallons (24.5 L) of wort.

Boil for 60 minutes, adding the hops according to the schedule. Add the honey and spices at the end of the boil to preserve as much aromatic quality as possible. Cut the fresh ginger into small pieces to maximize flavor and aroma.

Chill rapidly to 66 °F (19 °C) and pitch the yeast. Oxygenate thoroughly. When fermentation is fully complete after 14 days, drop the temperature about 6 °F (3 °C) per day for four days to help clear the beer. Keg and carbonate to 2.5 volumes or prime and bottle condition.

Ingredients
6 lbs. (2.7 kg) Briess Pilsen dried malt extract
1 lb. (0.45 kg) crystal malt (45 °L)
1 lb. (0.45 kg) unmalted white wheat
0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) Briess Special Roast (50 °L) malt

Wyeast 1098 (British Ale) or White Labs WLP007 (English Dry Ale) or LalBrew Nottingham yeast
3⁄4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Using a 5-gallon (19-L) kettle, start by steeping just the unmalted wheat (placed in a muslin bag) in 2 gallons (7.6 L) of water at 152 °F (67 °C) for 30 minutes. Then, introduce the rest of the specialty grains into the bag and steep for another 10–15 minutes. Remove grain bag then increase kettle volume with water to about 4 gallons (15 L). Bring liquid to or near a boil. Turn off the flame and slowly add half the malt extract, stirring to avoid clumping or scorching. Adding just half of the extract here maximizes hop isomerization. Turn flame back on and bring to boil. Add remaining malt extract with 15 minutes until knockout. Follow the remainder of the all-grain recipe for boil, fermenting, and packaging instructions. After chilling the beer, but before pitching your yeast, remember to top up with water to 5 gallons (19 L).

Ingredients
3.3 lbs. (1.5 kg) Muntons light, unhopped, liquid malt extract
2 lbs. (0.9 kg) light dried malt extract
1 lb. (0.45 kg) 2-row pale malt
10 oz. (0.28 kg) Carafa® Special malt (400 °L)
6 oz. (0.17 kg) Munich malt
7 oz. (0.19 kg) Carawheat® malt (40 °L)
6.5 AAU Magnum pellet hops (60 min.) (0.5 oz./ 14 g of 13% alpha acid)
1.85 AAU Hallertauer pellet hops (10 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g of 3.7% alpha acid)
1⁄2 tsp. Irish moss (last 15 minutes)
White Labs WLP 830 (German lager) or Wyeast 2308 (Munich lager) yeast
0.75 cup (150 g) corn sugar for priming (if bottling)

Step by Step
Steep the crushed grain in 2 gallons (7.6 L) of water at 154 ºF (68 °C) for 30 minutes. Remove grains from the wort and rinse with 2 quarts (1.8 L) of hot water. Add the liquid and dried malt extracts and bring to a boil and add the hops and Irish moss as per the schedule. Add the wort to 2 gallons (7.6 L) of cold water in a sanitized fermenter and top off with cold water up to 5 gallons (19 L). Cool the wort to 75 ºF (24 ºC). Pitch your yeast and aerate the wort heavily. Allow the beer to cool over the next few hours to 65 ºF (18 ºC). When evidence of fermentation is apparent drop the temperature to 52 ºF (11 ºC). Hold at that temperature until fermentation is complete (approx. 10 days). Transfer to a carboy, avoiding any splashing to prevent aerating the beer. Condition for 2 weeks at 42 ºF (5 ºC) and then bottle or keg. Allow to carbonate and age for 4 weeks and enjoy your Black Lager.

All-grain option:
This is a single step infusion mash. Replace the malt syrup with 6.75 lbs. (3 kg) 2-row pale malt and increase the Munich malt to 3.5 lbs.(1.6 kg). Mix the crushed grains with 3.5 gallons (13 L) of 172 °F (78 °C) water to stabilize at 154 ºF (68 ºC) for 60 minutes. Sparge slowly with 175 ºF (79 ºC) water. Collect approximately 6 gallons (23 L) of wort runoff to boil for 60 minutes. Reduce the 60 minute hop additions to 0.4 oz. (11g) Magnum and 0.4 oz. (11g) Hallertauer to allow for the higher utilization factor of a full wort boil. The remainder of this recipe and procedures are the same as the extract with grains recipe.

IBU = 25 SRM = 29 ABV = 7.2%

Ingredients
13.5 lbs. (6.1 kg) Golden Promise malt
1.25 lbs. (0.57 kg) Briess Victory® malt 28 °L
10 oz. (0.27 kg) British caramel malt (70/80 °L)
3 oz. (85 g) roasted barley (550 °L)
3 oz. (85 g) peated malt
6.9 AAU Willamette hops (1.25 oz./35 g of 5.5% alpha acids) (60 min.)
1 tsp. Irish moss or 1 Whirfloc tablet (15 min.)
White Labs WLP028 (Edinburgh Scottish Ale Yeast) or Wyeast 1728 (Scottish Ale Yeast) yeast
0.75 cup (150 g) priming sugar (if bottling)

Step by Step
Mill the grains. Dough in using 5 gallons (19 L) of water with a target mash holding temperature of 156 °F (69 °C). Hold the mash temperature for approximately 60 minutes or until the conversion is complete. Raise the temperature of the mash to 168 °F (76 °C) and begin sparging with 170 °F (77 °C) water until you collect 6.0 gallons (22.7 L) gallons of wort in the kettle.
Total boiling time for this recipe is 60 minutes. Add the Willamette hop addition at the start of the boil (60 min.). Add the Irish moss or Whirfloc tablets when 15 minutes remain in the boil. After the boil is finished, cool the wort to 70 °F (21 °C), transfer to your fermentation vessel and aerate the wort adequately. Add yeast to the chilled wort. Ferment around 70 °F (21 °C) until the final gravity is reached, which should be in five to seven days. Rack to a secondary vessel and allow the beer to mature another five to seven days around the same temperature. Your beer is now ready to rack into a keg or bottles along with the priming sugar.

Tips for Success:
Traditional Scottish breweries originally drew water from underground sources. Although some no longer have private wells, soft water remains the ideal base for a malty Scotch ale. If you want to brew maltier styles like Scotch ale, and you haven’t done so already, request a water report from your town or city (if you are using a municipal water source) or have your home water supply tested to find out what is in your water. (Read more about the basics of water reports in "Beginner’s Block" in the July-August 2012 issue of BYO.)

Green Leaf Brewing Company’s Green Leaf Stout clone
(5 gallons/19 L, extract with grains)
OG = 1.057 FG = 1.012 IBU = 36 SRM = 45 ABV = 5.9%

With a dense tan head, Green Leaf Brewing's Stout has a nose that exhibits notes of chocolate, coffee, and roasted malt. It's heavy-bodied with a balance of sweetness and bitterness.

Ingredients
3.3 lbs. (1.5 kg) Coopers light, unhopped, liquid malt extract
1.75 lbs. (0.79 kg) light dried malt extract
8 oz. (0.23 kg) crystal malt (60 °L)
8 oz. (0.23 kg) crystal malt (120 °L)
14 oz. (0.40 kg) chocolate malt (350 °L)
11 oz. (0.31 kg) roasted barley (450 °L)
10 oz. (0.28 kg) Carapils® (dextrin) malt
7 oz. (0.20 kg) flaked barley
10 oz. (0.28 kg) flaked oats
8.5 AAU Northern Brewer hop pellets (60 min.) (1 oz./28 g at 8.5% alpha acids)
4.25 AAU Northern Brewer hop pellets (30 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 8.5% alpha acids)
1/2 tsp. Irish moss (30 min.)
1/2 tsp. yeast nutrient (15 min.)
White Labs WLP001 (California Ale) or Wyeast 1056 (American Ale) or Safale US-05 yeast
2⁄3 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Steep the crushed grains in 2.25 gallons (8.5 L) of water at 154 °F (68 ºC) for 30 minutes. Remove grains from the wort and rinse with 2 quarts (1.9 L) of hot water. Add the malt extracts and boil for 60 minutes. While boiling, add the hops, Irish moss and yeast nutrient as per the schedule. When done, add the wort to 2 gallons (7.6 L) of cold water in the sanitized fermenter and top off with cold water up to 5 gallons (19 L).

Cool the wort to 75 ºF (24 ºC). Pitch your yeast and aerate the wort heavily. Allow the beer to cool to 68 ºF (20 ºC). Hold at that temperature until fermentation is complete and then transfer to a carboy and allow the beer to condition for 1 week before bottling or kegging.

All-grain option:
This is a single step infusion mash using 8.5 lbs. (3.9 kg) of 2-row pale malt to replace the malt extracts. Mix all of the crushed grains with 4.75 gallons (18 L) of 171 °F (77 °C) water to stabilize at 154 ºF (68 ºC) for 60 minutes. Slowly sparge with 175 ºF (79 ºC) water. Collect approximately 6 gallons (23 L) of wort runoff to boil for 60 minutes. Reduce the 60-minute Northern Brewer hop addition to 6.8 AAU (0.8 oz./23 g) and the 30 minute Northern Brewer hop addition to 3.4 AAU (0.4 oz./11 g) to allow for the higher utilization factor of a full wort boil. The remainder of this recipe is the same as the extract with grains recipe.

Allagash Brewing Company: Curieux clone
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.073  FG = 1.006
IBU = 30  SRM = 4  ABV = 9.3%

"Curieux is a fairly simple recipe starting with our Tripel, which is then aged in bourbon barrels and blended with another batch of fresh Tripel." – Michael O’Connor, Allagash Brewing Company

Ingredients
12 lbs. (5.4 kg) 2-row pale malt or Pilsner malt
1.7 lbs. (0.77 kg) granulated sugar (10 min.)
3 AAU German Perle hops (75 min.) (0.8 oz./23 g at 8% alpha acids)
3 AAU German Spalt hops (10 min.) (0.9 oz./26 g at 4.2% alpha acids)
0.9 oz. (26 g) Styrian Golding hops (0 min.)
1⁄2 tsp. yeast nutrient (10 min.)
1⁄2 Whirlfloc tablet (10 min.)
Bourbon soaked oak chips or spirals
Wyeast 3787 (Trappist High Gravity) yeast or White Labs WLP530 (Abbey Ale) or Wyeast 1214 (Belgian Abbey) or White Labs WLP550 (Belgian Ale) or yeast harvested from Allagash White yeast
3⁄4 cup (150 g) dextrose (if priming)

Step by Step
Mash at 149 °F (65 °C) for 45 minutes using 3.75 gallons (14.2 L) of strike water. You can perform a mash-out if you’d like but it’s not necessary. Run off, sparge with enough water to collect 7 gallons (26.5 L), and boil the wort for 90 minutes adding hops at times indicated in the ingredients list. Add the sugar, yeast nutrients, and Whirlfloc® with 10 minutes remaining in the boil. After the boil, chill to 65 °F (18 °C) and oxygenate. Rack to your fermenter and pitch yeast. You can allow the temperature to rise after a couple days of fermentation. The beer’s terminal gravity should be around 1.006.

For wood-aging and blending, O’Connor states, "we generally age Tripel in bourbon barrels for 6–8 weeks at 55 °F (18 °C). It is then blended to taste with fresh Tripel before packaging. Curieux should have a subtle bourbon character with hints of vanilla and coconut. To replicate this at home, try soaking 1–2 oz. of oak chips or spirals in your favorite bourbon for a couple weeks. Then when fermentation is complete, rack into a secondary vessel on top of the bourbon soaked oak. I recommend tasting the beer every two to three days. It probably won’t take long for the beer to develop the subtle flavors that you’re looking for. Oak cubes are also an option but be aware that the entire process may take much longer when both soaking the oak in bourbon and aging the beer on the cubes.

Package the beer as soon as it has developed the desired character. Allagash bottles/keg conditions, but feel free to package the beer any way you choose." If the beer has been aging for several months, you can opt to add extra yeast if you plan to bottle condition this beer.

Extract only option: Substitute the 2-row/Pilsner pale malt in the all-grain recipe with 6.5 lbs. (3 kg) Pilsen dried malt extract. Heat 6.5 gallons (25 L) water in your brew pot up to a boil. Add the dried malt extract when the water approaches a boil. Stir well then bring it to a boil. Boil the wort for 75 minutes adding hops at times indicated in the ingredients list. Add the sugar, yeast nutrients, and Whirlfloc® with 10 minutes remaining in the boil. Follow the remaining portion of the all-grain recipe.

Tips for Success: Allagash has their own proprietary strain of yeast. The ingredients list contains several great strains readily available to homebrewers. O’Connor recommends, "If you’re feeling adventurous and practice excellent sanitation, you can propagate the Allagash house yeast from a bottle of Allagash White. Our other beers contain an additional yeast strain added just before packaging so a bottle of white is the only way to procure the house strain."

Grodziskie
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.030 FG = 1.007
IBU = 30 SRM = 3-4 ABV = 2.9%

Ingredients
5 lbs. (2.3 kg) Weyermann oak-smokedwheat malt
1 lb. (0.45 kg) red wheat malt
1 lb. (0.45 kg) rice hulls
3.75 AAU Lubelski hops (60 min.) (0.75 oz./21 g at 5% alpha acids)
6.25 AAU Lubelski hops (10 min.) (1.25 oz./35 g at 5% alpha acids)
Isinglass
Wyeast 1007 (German Ale) or White Labs WLP003 (German Ale II) or Safale K-97 yeast
1 cup (200 g) corn sugar (if priming)

Step by step
My water profile (in ppm) was as follows: Ca2+ 55, Mg2+ 34, Na+ 32, SO42- 145, Cl- 67, HCO3- 80. On brew day, crush the grains and mash in with 1.75 gallons (6.5 L) of strike water at 134 °F (57 °C) to stabilize at 122 °F (50 °C). This is a strike water to grain ratio of 1.15 qts./lb. or 2.4 L/kg. Hold at this temperature for 30 minutes for a protein rest. Infuse mash with 1.15 gallons (4.4 L) of boiling water to raise mash temperature to 152 °F (67 °C). Hold at this temperature for 60 minutes for a saccharification rest. Sparge with 4.4 gallons (16.7 L) for a pre-boil volume of 6.25 gallons (23.7 L).

Boil for 60 minutes, adding hops as per the recipe. When the boil is complete, cool to 64 °F (18 °C), aerate, and pitch yeast. Allow to ferment and condition for 10–14 days prior to packing. Carbonate (preferably by bottle conditioning) to 3.5 volumes of CO2 and cold condition for two weeks.

Additional Information:

Grodziskie also makes a good base for other flavors. There are many varieties of fruited, soured, dry-hopped, and dark Grodziskie on the market. We tend to gravitate towards hoppier beers in general, and by keeping the same grain bill as above, but tweaking the hop schedule, we can make a "New England Grodziskie" that’s got a lot more of that hoppy, herbal, spicy flavor. For that recipe we add 1 oz. (28 g) Lubelski at the start of the boil, 1 oz. (28 g) at the beginning of a 15-minute whirlpool, and 1 oz. (28 g) dry hop addition at high kräusen.

Because this recipe relies so heavily on oak-smoked wheat malt, formulating an extract with grain version would be very difficult.

Groom Lake IPA
Groom Lake IPA
(5 gallons/19 L, extract with grains)
OG = 1.056 FG = 1.014
IBU = 51 SRM = 9 ABV = 5.4%

Ingredients
1.5 lbs. (0.68 kg) US 2-row pale malt
0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) crystal malt (40 °L)
2 lb. 2 oz. (0.96 kg) light dried malt extract
4 lb. 2 oz. (1.9 kg) light liquid malt extract (late addition)
6 AAU Magnum hops (60 min.) (0.43 oz./12 g of 14% alpha acids)
3.5 AAU Simcoe hops (60 min.) (0.27 oz./7.6 g of 13% alpha acids)
7.5 AAU Centennial hops (15 min.) (0.75 oz./14 g of 10% alpha acids)
0.75 oz. (21 g) Cascade hops (5 min.)
1.5 oz. (43 g) Cascade hops (dry hop)
1 tsp. Irish moss (15 min.)
Wyeast 1056 (American Ale), White Labs WLP001 (California Ale) or Safale US-05 yeast (1.5 qt./~1.5 L yeast starter)
1.0 cup corn sugar (for priming)

Step by Step
Place crushed grains in a steeping bag. In a large kitchen pot, heat 3.0 qts. (2.8 L) of water to 163 °F (73 °C). Submerge grain bag in this water and let steep at 152 °F (67 °C) for 45 minutes. (If the temperature drops below 148 °F (64 °C), heat to 152 °F (67 °C) again.)

While grains are steeping, heat 1.5 qts. (~1.5 L) of water to 170 °F (77 °C) in a soup pan. Also, begin heating 2 gallons (7.6 L) of water to a boil in your brewpot. When steeping is done, place a colander over your brewpot and lift the grain bag into it. Pour the "grain tea" through the bag (which will strain out most of the grain bits), then rinse the bag with the 1.5 qts. (~1.5 L) of 170 °F (77 °C) water.

Heat the (roughly) 3 gallons (11 L) of wort in your brewpot to a boil, then stir in dried malt extract. (It will foam a bit, so don’t pour all the extract in at once.) Bring the wort back to a boil, add the 60-minute hops and boil for 60 minutes, adding late hops at times indicated. Stir in liquid malt extract and add Irish moss with 15 minutes left in boil.

During the boil, scrape any hops clinging to the side of the brewpot back into the wort. Also, do not let the wort volume drop below 2.5 gallons (9.5 L). Keep a small pot of boiling water handy to top up boil, if needed.

After the boil, put a lid on your brewpot and cool the wort (either in a cold-water bath in your sink or with a wort chiller). Cool until the side of the brewpot no longer feels warm, then let it sit for about an hour (with the lid on) to let the hop debris settle. With a racking cane, transfer the wort above the hop "sludge" to your fermenter. Pour the remaining wort/sludge slowly through a sanitized strainer.

Top wort up to 5 gallons (19 L) with cool water, aerate wort and pitch the yeast from your starter. Ferment at 70 °F (21 °F). When fermentation slows to a halt, rack to secondary. Add the dry hops a few days later, then bottle or keg after beer has been in contact with dry hops for 3–4 days.

Groom Lake IPA
(5 gallons/19 L, partial mash)
OG = 1.056 FG = 1.012
IBU = 51 SRM = 9  ABV = 5.7%

This version of Groom Lake IPA is more highly-attenuated than the extract with grains version and shows a little more malt aroma. Follow the instructions closely and the light color, high attenuation, alluring aroma and firm bitterness of this beer will render it unidentifiable as a stovetop beer.

Ingredients
3.5 lbs. (1.6 kg) US 2-row pale malt
0.5 lbs. (0.23 kg) crystal malt (40 °L)
1 lb. 12 oz. (0.79 kg) light dried malt extract
3 lb. 4 oz. (1.5 kg) light liquid malt extract (late addition)
6 AAU Magnum hops (60 min.) (0.43 oz./12 g of 14% alpha acids)
3.5 AAU Simcoe hops (60 min.) (0.27 oz./7.6 g of 13% alpha acids)
7.5 AAU Centennial hops (15 min.) (0.75 oz./14 g of 10% alpha acids)
0.75 oz. (21 g) Cascade hops (5 min.)
1.5 oz. (43 g) Cascade hops (dry hop)
1 tsp. Irish moss (15 min.)
Wyeast 1056 (American Ale), White Labs WLP001 (California Ale) or Safale US-05 yeast (1.5 qt./~1.5 L yeast starter)
1.0 cup corn sugar (for priming)

Step by Step
Put crushed grains in a large nylon steeping bag. Heat 5.5 qts. (5.2 L) of water to 163 °F (73 °C) and pour into your 2-gallon (7.6-L) cooler. Slowly submerge grain bag, then open the bag and use a large brewing spoon to ensure that grain mixes completely with the water. Let mash rest, starting at 152 °F (67 °C) for 45 minutes. While mash is resting, heat 0.75 gallons (2.8 L) of water to 152 °F (67 °C) in your brewpot and stir in dried malt extract. Hold the dissolved malt extract at 152 °F (67 °C). Also heat 5.5 qts. (5.2 L) of water to 180 °F (82 °C) in a large kitchen pot.

Recirculate your partial mash wort by drawing off a pint or two of wort from the cooler and returning it to the top of the mash. Repeat until wort is clear or 3 quarts (~3 L) have been recirculated. Next, run off entire first wort and add to the hot wort in your kettle. Continue holding wort in brewpot around 152 °F (67 °C) while you prepare to draw off the second wort.

Add 180 °F (82 °C) water to cooler until liquid level is the same as during the first mash. Let rest for 5 minutes, then recirculate and run off wort as before. Bring wort to a boil, add bittering hops and boil for 60 minutes. Add other hops at times indicated in ingredient list. Stir in liquid malt extract and add Irish moss with 15 minutes left in boil.

During the boil, scrape any hops clinging to the side of the brewpot back into the wort. Also, do not let wort volume drop below 3.0 gallons (11 L). Keep a small pot of boiling water handy to top up boil.

After the boil, put a lid on your brewpot and cool the wort (either in a cold-water bath in your sink or with a wort chiller). Cool until the side of the brewpot no longer feels warm, then let it sit for about an hour (with the lid on) to let the hop debris settle. With a racking cane, transfer the wort above the hop "sludge" to your fermenter. Pour the remaining wort/sludge slowly through a sanitized strainer.

Top wort up to 5 gallons (19 L) with cool water, aerate wort and pitch the yeast from your starter. Ferment at 70 °F (21 °F). When fermentation slows to a halt, rack to secondary. Add the dry hops a few days later, then bottle or keg after beer has been in contact with dry hops for 3–4 days.

1/2 oz. (14 g) dried rosemary
1 package ale yeast (English or German wheat beer)
1/2 cup dry malt extract or corn sugar (for priming)

Step by Step
Place the herb mixture into a pot. Boil about two quarts (or two liters) of water. Pour over the herbs and let steep for about one hour. Meanwhile, single-infusion mash the grain at about 152 °F (67 ºC). Let rest for about an hour. Then sparge, allowing the grain bed temperature to rise to about 165–170 °F (~75 ºC), but not above.

Boil for about half an hour to coagulate the proteins into trub. Turn off the heat and strain the herb tea through a sieve into the wort. Let the wort rest for about 30 minutes to precipitate the trub. If your gravity is slightly off at the end of the boil, do not worry: You are making gruitbier!

Heat-exchange the wort to the fermentation temperature of the selected yeast. Rack the brew after about three weeks, prime and package. The brew is ready to drink after about a week of conditioning.

Gruit Ale
(5 gallons or 19 L, extract with grain)
OG = 1.064 FG = 1.014
SRM = 45 ABV = 6.6%

Ingredients
6 lbs. (2.7 kg) pale ale liquid malt extract
1.0 lb. (0.45 kg) Briess flaked barley (1.5 °L)
2.5 lbs. (1.14 kg) dark Briess Munich malt (20 °L)
0.5 lbs (approx. 0.23 kg) Briess roasted barley (300 °L)
1.0 lb. (approx. 0.45 kg) Weyermann dark wheat malt (6–8 °L)
1/2 oz. (56 g) dried lavender
2 oz. (56 g) dried woodruff
1/2 oz. (14 g) dried juniper berries
1/2 oz. (14 g) dried rosemary
1 package ale yeast (English or German wheat beer)
1/2 cup dry malt extract or corn sugar (for priming)

Step by Step
Prepare the herb mixture as described for the all-grain version. Mill the specialty malts and steep in four bags for about an hour in about two gallons (eight liters) of water at about 160 °F (71 ºC).

Remove the bags and stir in the extract. Add another 2 gallons (7.6 liters) of additional water. Boil for about 20 minutes. Then strain the herb tea into the wort and measure the gravity. Because it is not certain how great a contribution to extract you achieved from the steeped grain, take a gravity reading and add enough water to get close to the target OG.

Then heat-exchange the wort to the fermentation temperature of the selected yeast (most likely close to room temperature). Rack the brew after about three weeks, prime and package. Age at least a week and enjoy!

1-1/4 cup Muntons extra light dried malt extract (if priming)

Step by Step:  

Bring 5 gallons (19 L) of water to 155 °F (69 °C), add crushed grain in a grain bag and hold for 30 minutes. Remove the grain bag into the brewpot and sparge with one gallon of 168 °F (76 °C) water. Add the dried malt, maltodextrin and hops. Bring the total volume in the brewpot to 6 gallons (23 L).

Boil for 45 min., then add the Irish moss. Boil for 15 min., then remove pot from stove and add all the spices. Allow the spices to steep for 10 minutes, then cool wort. Strain into the primary fermenter and add water to obtain 5.25 gallons (20 L).

Add yeast when wort has cooled to below 80 °F (27 °C). Oxygenate or aerate well. Ferment at 68 °F (20 °C) for 7 days then rack into secondary. Ferment until target gravity has been reached and beer has cleared (approximately 3 weeks). Prime and bottle or keg and force carbonate. If bottling, carbonate at 70-72°F (21-22 °C) for 2 to 3 weeks. Store at cellar temperature.

Partial-mash option:

Mash 1.75 lbs. (0.8 kg) two-row pale malt and the specialty grains in 1 gallon water at 150 °F (66 °C) for 60 min. Sparge with 2 gallons (7.6 L) water at 168 °F (76 °C). Then follow the extract recipe, reducing the Muntons extra light dry malt extract (DME) to 5.75 lbs. (2.6 L).

OG = 1.093 FG = 1.024
IBU = 44 SRM = 6 ABV = 9.9%

This is a big bear that rings up close to 10% ABV. Belgian characteristics from the yeast blend well with aromatic Pacific Northwest hops for a complex, yet satisfyingly drinkable brew.

Ingredients
17 lbs. (7.7 kg) Belgian Pilsner malt
1 lb. (0.45 kg) clear Belgian candy sugar
8 oz. (0.23 kg) acidulated malt
5.5 AAU Target hops (80 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 11% alpha acids)
7.5 AAU Styrian Aurora hops (30 min.) (1 oz./28 g at 7.5% alpha acids)
14 AAU Columbus hops (3 min.) (1 oz./28 g at 14% alpha acids)
1 oz. (28 g) Cascade hops (0 min.)
1 oz. (28 g) Columbus hops (dry hop)
1 oz. (28 g) Cascade hops (dry hop)
Wyeast 3522 (Belgian Ardennes) or White Labs WLP550 (Belgian Ale) yeast
3⁄4 cup (150 g) dextrose (if priming)

Step by Step
Mill the grains and mix with 5.5 gallons (20.7 L) of 164 °F (73 °C) strike water to reach a mash temperature of 152 °F (67 °C). Hold this temperature for 60 minutes. Vorlauf until your runnings are clear, and lauter into the kettle. Sparge the grains with 4 gallons (15 L) and top up as necessary to obtain 6.5 gallons (25 L) of wort. Add half of the Belgian candy sugar to the wort and boil for 90 minutes, adding hops according to the ingredient list. When the boil is complete, turn off heat and whirlpool for at least five minutes. Then chill to 65 °F (18 °C), aerate, and pitch yeast. Ferment at 66 °F (19 °C) for 7 days, adding the remaining Belgian candy sugar after 1–2 days. At seven days, allow the beer to free-rise to 80 °F (27 °C), add dry hops, and age for seven more days. Once the beer reaches terminal gravity, bottle or keg the beer and carbonate to approximately 2.5 volumes. You may want to cold-crash the beer prior to packaging to 35 °F (2 °C) for 48 hours to improve clarity.

Extract option:
Substitute all of the grains in the all-grain recipe with 9.5 lbs. (4.3 kg) Pilsen dried malt extract and 1 tsp. lactic acid (88% solution). Bring 5.2 gallons (19.7 L) of water to a boil. Remove from heat, then add dried malt extract and stir until completely dissolved. Add half of the Belgian candy sugar and lactic acid to the wort and boil for 60 minutes. Follow the remaining portion of the all-grain recipe.

Tips for Success:
Brewmaster Mark Knoebl notes that since Belgian yeast strains tend to scrub out a lot of kettle hop flavors and aromas, it’s important to use a healthy dose of dry hops. Also, being a rather high-octane beer, it is important to manage your fermentation processes and temperatures to ensure full attenuation and minimize hot alcohols.

0.5 oz. (14 g) coriander, crushed (0 min.)
Wyeast 3463 (Forbidden Fruit), White Labs WLP400 (Belgian Wit Ale), Imperial Yeast B44 (Whiteout),
or SafAle K-97 yeast
7⁄8 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by step
Heat 15.5 qts. (14.6 L) of strike water to 165 °F (74 °C). Mix with grains. The mash should stabilize at about 152 °F (67 °C). Hold at this temperature for 60 minutes, then raise temperature to mash out at about 168 °F (76 °C), either by infusion of boiling water, decoction, or other means. Vorlauf until wort runs clear then begin the sparge process. Collect 7 gallons (26.5 L) and bring to a boil. Total boil time is 75 minutes, adding hops as indicated. After boil is complete, turn off the heat, add the final hop addition along with the coriander and orange peel bagged (it helps to bag the coriander and orange peel) and give a long stir to create a whirlpool. After 15 minutes remove the spice bag.

Chill the wort to 65 °F (18 °C). There should be about 5.5 gallons (21 L) of wort in your fermenter. Add yeast and aerate wort if using liquid yeast. Place your fermenter in a temperature-stable place in the 68–72 °F (20–22 °C) range. Bottle or keg after fermentation is complete, targeting a carbonation level of 2.7 v/v.

Step by step
Put all the grains in a steeping bag, then heat 2 gallons (7.6 L) of water to 159 °F (71 °C). Add the grain bag. The target mash temperature is 152 °F
(67 °C). Hold at this temperature for 60 minutes. Rinse the grain bag with 170 °F (77 °C) water to top up to 7 gallons (26.5 L), remove bag, then boil. (If your brew kettle doesn’t allow for that large of a volume, rinse the grain bag with another gallon/4 L of water, remove bag, then raise to a boil.) When boil is achieved, take the kettle off the flame and slowly add the extract while stirring. Return to heat source and boil for 60 minutes, adding hops as indicated. After boil is complete, turn off the heat, add the final hop addition along with the coriander and orange peel bagged (it helps to bag the coriander and orange peel) and give a long stir to create a whirlpool. After 15 minutes remove the spice bag.

Chill the wort to 65 °F (18 °C). If you brewed a smaller volume, top off fermenter with pre-chilled water. In either case, the goal is to collect 5.5 gallons (21 L) of wort in your fermenter. Add yeast and aerate wort if using liquid yeast. Place your fermenter in a temperature-stable place in the 68–72 °F (20–22 °C) range. Bottle or keg after fermentation is complete, targeting a carbonation level of 2.7 v/v.

Place crushed pale ale malt and flaked barley in a steeping bag. In a large kitchen pot, heat 4.5 qts. (4.3 L) to 161 °F (72 °C) and submerge grain bag. Let grains steep for 45 minutes at around 150 °F (66 °C). Add the crushed roasted barley in a separate grain bag and steep another 15 minutes. While grains are steeping, begin heating 2.1 gallons (7.9 L) of water in your brewpot. When steep is over, remove 1.25 qts. (1.2 L) of water from brewpot and add to the "grain tea" in steeping pot. Place colander over brewpot and place steeping bags in it. Pour diluted grain tea through grain bag. Heat liquid in brewpot to a boil, then add the hops and begin the 60 minute boil. With 15 minutes left in boil, turn off heat and stir in liquid malt extract. Stir well to dissolve extract, then resume heating. (Keep the boil clock running while you stir.) At the end of the boil, cool wort and transfer to fermenter. Add water to make 5 gallons (19 L), aerate wort and pitch yeast. Ferment at 72 °F (22 °C). Rack to secondary when fermentation is complete. Bottle when beer falls clear.

Wang, Dang, Sweet Guinness Tang
To get that "Guinness tang," try this. After pitching the yeast to your stout, siphon 19 oz. of pitched wort to a sanitized 22 oz. bottle. Pitch bottle with a small amount of Brettanomyces and Lactobacillus. Cover bottle with aluminum foil and let ferment. When beer in bottle is done fermenting, pour it in a saucepan and heat to 160 °F (71 °C) for 15 minutes. Cool the beer and pour and pour it back in the bottle. Cap bottle and refrigerate. Add to stout when bottling or kegging.

OG = 1.041 (10.3°P) FG = 1.010 (2.6°P)
IBU = 41 SRM = 35 ABV = 4.1%

Ingredients

6.25 lb. (2.83 kg) British pale ale malt or similar Maris Otter malt
1.75 lb. (794 g) flaked barley
14.0 oz. (397 g) roasted barley (500 °L) (crushed to powder)
8.35 AAU Kent Golding pellet hops (1.67 oz./47 g at 5% alpha acid) (60 min.)
White Labs WLP004 (Irish Ale), Wyeast 1084 (Irish Ale) or Fermentis Safale US-05 yeast
1/2 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step

Crush the roasted barley very fine. Run it through a coffee mill or use a rolling pin to turn it almost to dust. That is critical to getting the right flavor and color with this recipe. Mill the remaining grains as normal and dough-in targeting a mash of around 1.5 quarts of water to 1 pound of grain (a liquor-to-grist ratio of about 3:1 by weight) and a temperature of 120 °F (49 °C). Hold the mash at 120 °F (49 °C) for 15 minutes then raise the temperature to 150 °F (66 °C) until enzymatic conversion is complete. Raise the temperature to mash out at 168 °F (76 °C). Sparge slowly with 170 °F (77 °C) water, collecting wort until the pre-boil kettle volume is around 6.5 gallons (24.4 L) and the gravity is 1.032 (8.1 °P).

The total wort boil time is 90 minutes. Add the bittering hops with 60 minutes remaining in the boil. Add Irish moss or other kettle finings with 15 minutes left in the boil. Chill the wort rapidly to 65 °F (18 °C), let the break material settle, rack to the fermenter, pitch the yeast and aerate.

Ferment at 65 °F (18 °C). Slowly raise the temperature during the final 1⁄3 of fermentation by 6 °F (3 °C) to reduce diacetyl levels in the beer. When finished, carbonate the beer to approximately 1 to 1.5 volumes and serve at 52 to 55 °F (11 to 13 °C).

(5 gallons/19 L, extract with grains)
OG = 1.041  FG = 1.010
IBU = 41  SRM = 35  ABV = 4.1%

Ingredients

5.25 lbs. (2.4 kg) Maris Otter liquid malt extract
14 oz. (397 g) roasted barley (500 °L) (crushed to powder)
10 AAU Kent Golding hops (60 min.) (2 oz./57 g at 5% alpha acids)
White Labs WLP004 (Irish Ale), Wyeast 1084 (Irish Ale), or Fermentis Safale US-05 yeast
⅓ cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step

Crush the roasted barley very fine. Run it through a coffee mill or use a rolling pin to turn it almost to dust. That is critical to getting the right flavor and color with this recipe. Place the crushed roasted barley in a muslin bag and steep in 5.5 gallons (21 L) water as it heats up to 170 °F (77 °C). Remove the grain bag and let drip back into the kettle. Now remove the kettle from heat and stir in the liquid malt extract. The pre-boil kettle volume should now be around 6 gallons (23 L) and the gravity is 1.032.

The total wort boil time is 60 minutes. Add the bittering hops with 60 minutes remaining in the boil. Add Irish moss or other kettle finings with 15 minutes left in the boil. Chill the wort rapidly to 65 °F (18 °C), let the break material settle, rack to the fermenter, pitch the yeast and aerate.

Ferment at 65 °F (18 °C). Slowly raise the temperature during the final 1⁄3 of fermentation by 6 °F (3 °C) to reduce diacetyl levels in the beer. When finished, carbonate the beer to approximately 1 to 1.5 volumes and serve at 52 to 55 °F (11 to 13 °C).

Partial Mash Option

The recipe becomes 1 lb. (0.45 kg) British pale ale malt, 1.75 lb. (794 g) flaked barley, 14 oz. (397 g) roasted barley, and 3.5 lb. (1.58 kg) Muntons pale ale liquid malt extract. Place the crushed grains and flaked barley in a steeping bag. Heat 5 quarts (~ 5 L) to 160 °F (71 °C), add grain bag, and let steep for approximately one hour. Rinse out the grains and proceed as normal, adding the extract and water to the steeping liquor.

SafAle K-97 or LalBrew Köln Kölsch Style Ale or a clean German ale yeast
3⁄4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Dough-in at 95 °F (35 °C), then begin to raise temperature to 144 °F (62 °C); rest 30 minutes and then raise temperature to 154 °F (68 °C); rest 20 minutes; raise temperature to 162 °F (72 °C); rest 20 minutes; raise temperature for mash-out to 172 °F (78 °C) (which was achieved in Bamberg with a 5-minute decoction boil of one quarter of the mash). Lauter/sparge as usual. Boil 75 minutes, adding hops as indicated.

When the boil is complete, whirlpool for 15 minutes and then cool to 66 °F (19 °C) into an open fermenter. Package when terminal gravity of 1.014 is reached.

Güstrower Kniesenack
(5 gallons/19 L, partial mash)
OG = 1.076 FG = 1.014
IBU= 15 SRM = 18 ABV= 8.1%

Ingredients
7 lbs. (3.2 kg) Pilsen dried malt extract
2.65 lbs. (1.2 kg) Weyermann Beech-Smoked Barley malt (rauchmalz)
6 oz. (0.17 kg) Weyermann Carafa® II malt
3.4 AAU Tettnanger hops (60 min.) (0.75 oz./21 g at 4.5% alpha acids)
SafAle K-97 or LalBrew Köln Kölsch Style Ale or a clean German ale yeast
3⁄4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Place crushed grains in a large stock pot. Dough-in with 4.3 qts. (4 L) of water at 107 °F (42 °C) to stabilize mash at 95 °F (35 °C), then raise temperature to 144 °F (62 °C). Stirring while heating will help prevent potential scorching of the grains. Rest 30 minutes and then raise temperature to 154 °F (68 °C); rest 20 minutes; raise temperature to 162 °F (72 °C); rest 20 minutes; raise temperature for mash-out to 172 °F (78 °C). Dump grains into a large muslin bag and separate from the wort by placing in a large colander and washing with 1 gallon (4 L) of hot water. Top off to 6.5 gallons (25 L) then while off heat, stir in the dried malt extract. Once all the extract is dissolved, return wort to heat and bring to a boil. Follow the remainder of the all-grain recipe instructions.

Sensory Evaluation of Test Brew: This is a very balanced strong beer with a snow-white, very tall and sturdy head — obviously the result of the large amount of floor malts. The color resembles that of a Bavarian dunkel, but with an appealing burgundy hue. The malty bouquet is very complex with faint notes of honey, herbs, and strawberry. On the palate, the beer impresses with an extremely pleasant mix of smoke and warming alcohol leading into a noticeable residual sweetness in the finish. Overall, this "fine and gentle" kniesenack is reminiscent of barrel-aged whiskey.

Guthrie’s Woody Imperial Stout (Oak Aged)
(5 gallons/19 L, Extract with grains)
OG = 1.088 FG = 1.028
IBU = 68 SRM = 100+ ABV = 7.9%

Ingredients
8 lbs. (3.63 kg) amber liquid malt extract
3 lbs. (1.36 kg) pale dried malt extract
0.75 lbs. (0.340 kg) Belgian Special B malt
0.75 lbs. (0.340 kg) chocolate malt
0.75 lbs. (0.340 kg) black malt
18.5 AAU Columbus pellet hops (1.5 oz./43 g at 12.3% alpha acids) (60 min.)
Nottingham Ale dry yeast
1.5 oz. (43 g) medium toasted French oak cubes

Step by Step
Put the grains in a muslin bag and steep in 2 qts. (2 L) of 150–160 °F (65–71 °C) water for 20 to 30 minutes. Rinse the grains with an additional 2 qts (2 L) of hot water and transfer the liquid to a brewpot. Top up to 5 gallons (19 L) with water. Carefully dissolve the malt extracts and bring to a boil. Add hops and boil for 60 minutes.

Cool to 65–70 °F (18–21°C) and pitch the yeast, preferably having previously prepared it as a 2-qt. starter. When primary fermentation has finished rack the beer onto the oak cubes in a secondary fermenter if you wish. I prefer not to add the oak at this time, but to rack a second time after about five to six days and add the cubes then. This is because I want the beer to be as clear as possible during oaking; if there is a significant amount of yeast in the secondary it will merely coat the cubes and reduce the efficiency of extraction from the oak. At any rate leave the beer on the cubes for no more than two weeks before racking it and then bottling or kegging it in the usual way.

One other step I like to do with this beer is to very lightly rinse the cubes with bourbon whiskey before adding them to the beer in the secondary. This step helps to sanitize the cubes, and also adds just a hint of bourbon to the finished beer’s flavor — a taste that goes well with this kind of stout. Some brewers like to pre-treat the oak cubes with very hot water, but I don’t like to do that as you will remove a good deal of the oak flavors you want to get into the beer.

Step by step
Keep the light and dark grains separate. Heat 20.7 qts. (19.6 L) of strike water to 166 °F (74 °C). Mix with pale malt, oats, and wheat. The mash should stabilize at about 153 °F (67 °C). Hold at this temperature for 60 minutes, then add the crystal and roasted malts. Mix until homogenized. Begin lautering by raising temperature to mash out at about 168 °F (76 °C), either by infusion of boiling water, decoction, or other means. Vorlauf until wort runs clear then begin the sparge process. Collect 7 gallons (26.5 L) and bring to a boil. Total boil time is 75 minutes, adding hop additions as indicated.

After boil is complete, turn off the heat, add whirlpool addition and give a long stir to create a whirlpool. Rest for 15 minutes.

Chill the wort to 68 °F (20 °C). There should be about 5.5 gallons (21 L) of wort in your fermenter. Add yeast and aerate wort if using liquid yeast. Place your fermenter in a temperature-stable place in the 70–74 °F (21–23 °C) range. Bottle or keg after fermentation is complete, targeting a carbonation level of 2.65 v/v.

Ingredients
6.25 lbs. (2.8 kg) extra light dried malt extract
1.5 lbs. (0.68 kg) 2-row pale malt
1 lb. (0.45 kg) flaked oats
0.3 lb. (136 g) caramel malt (120 °L)

3⁄4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by step
Keeping the pale malt, oats and wheat in one steeping bag and the crystal and roasted grains in another, heat 2 gallons (7.6 L) of water to about 160 °F (71 °C) to achieve a mash temperature of 153 °F (67 °C) once you add the steeping bag with the pale malt, oats, and wheat. Mash for 45–60 minutes, until converted. Once mash is complete, add the dark and crystal steeping bag and steep for 10 minutes. Rinse the grain bags with 170 °F (77 °C) water to top up to 7 gallons (26.5 L), remove the bags, then boil. (If your brew kettle doesn’t allow for that large of a volume, rinse the grain bags with another gallon/4 L of water, remove bags, then raise to a boil.) When boil is achieved, take the kettle off the flame and slowly add the extract while stirring. Return to the heat source and boil for 75 minutes, adding hops and corn sugar as indicated.

After boil is complete, turn off the heat, add whirlpool addition and give a long stir to create a whirlpool. Rest for 15 minutes.

Chill the wort to 68 °F (20 °C). If you brewed a smaller volume, top off fermenter with pre-chilled water. In either case, the goal is to collect 5.5 gallons (21 L) of wort in your fermenter. Add yeast and aerate wort if using liquid yeast. Place your fermenter in a temperature-stable place in the 70–74 °F (21–23 °C) range. Bottle or keg after fermentation is complete, targeting a carbonation level of 2.65 v/v.

HammerSmith Ales English IPA
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.058 FG = 1.010
IBU = 54 SRM = 11 ABV = 6.2%

Recipe from Christopher Bowen's brewing log. This is a recipe that won a gold medal and best of show at the 2007 Great American Beer Festival in the ProAM catagory, a silver medal at the AHA regional and a gold medal at the Kona Beer Festival in 2008. It is based off of a 19th century recipe from Samuel Allsopp and Sons LTD, circa 1860s. English brewers used tons of American hops in many beers during the 19th and 20th centuries. This was dry-hopped with Chinook, but other than that I used all East Kent Goldings. Chinook is a distantly related cultivar of the Petham Golding.

Ingredients
10.5 lbs. (4.8 kg) British 2-row pale malt
14.4 oz. (0.41 kg) crystal malt (60 °L)
6.4 oz. (0.18 kg) amber malt
5.4 oz. (0.15 kg) torrified wheat
10 AAU East Kent Golding hops (2 oz./56 g at 5% alpha acids) (60 min.)
2.5 AAU East Kent Golding hops (0.5 oz./14 g at 5% alpha acids) (30 min.)
7.5 AAU East Kent Golding hops (1.5 oz./42 g at 5% alpha acids) (10 min.)
1.25 oz. Chinook hops (dry hops)
1 tablet Whirfloc (15 mins.)
1 tsp. yeast nutrients (15 mins.)
Wyeast 1275 (Thames Valley Ale) or White Labs WLP023 (Burton Ale) yeast
2/3 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
This is a single infusion mash. Target mash temperature is 152 °F (67 °C) mixing grains with 3.6 gallons (14 L) of strike water. Raise mash to 168 °F (76 °C) and begin lautering. Boil for 60 minutes adding the bittering hops at times indicated in the ingredients list. Add the Whirfloc tablet and yeast nutrients when 15 minutes remain in the boil. After the boil is finished, chill the wort to 67 °F (19 °C) and transfer to a sanitized fermentation vessel. Ferment at 67 °F (19 °C). Add the final addition of hops and store the beer an additional week at 58 °F (14 °C). Your beer is now ready to rack into a keg, or bottles along with the priming sugar.

Hard Ginger Beer
Hard Ginger Beer
(5 gallons/19 L)
OG = 1.038 FG = 0.995 ABV = 5.5%

Kit Harrington of Root Sellers’ advises, "Start with the freshest ingredients possible, they really show when you make ginger beer. I recommend getting a cold press masticating juicer and juice the ginger yourself."

Ingredients
4 lbs. (1.8 kg) pure cane sugar
1 tablespoon (15 mL) molasses
½ tsp. yeast nutrient
8 oz. (226 mL) lemon or lime (juiced)
8 oz. (226 mL) ginger root (juiced)
Clean fermenting ale yeast (Champagne works well also)
1 lb. (0.45 kg) sugar to backsweeten (added to cold keg)

Step by step
Bring sugar, molasses and water to a boil for 15 minutes. At flame out add yeast nutrient. Once cooled to yeast pitching temperature, add the yeast and allow the temperature to rise naturally to the upper limit of the yeast’s range; you want a good and fast ferment. After 10 days or so, cool to near freezing to drop out as much yeast you can. Transfer the clear finished ginger beer into an empty Corny keg and add the ginger juice, lemon (or lime) juice, and sugar (dissolved in 2 cups/500 mL boiling water) to backsweeten. Mix all this very well or the dense sugar syrup will drop to the bottom. Follow the same carbonation advice as the hard root beer recipe.

Packaging hard root and ginger beers:
Once the hard root beer or hard ginger beer fermentation has run its course, the next step is back sweetening and then bottling or kegging. If kegging, which is recommended for both brews over bottling, the root or ginger beer will be force carbonated. If you’re priming with corn sugar and bottling, do not use regular beer bottles as there will be more residual sugar than a normal beer, plus refermentation in the bottle, and this will likely result in exploding glass bottles, which are very dangerous and unpredictable. Instead, use bottles with thick, reinforced glass such as 750-mL bottles that are corked with a cage. Better still, use Champagne bottles. Store in refrigeration.

Hard Root Beer
Hard Root Beer
(5 gallons/19 L)
OG = 1.038 FG = 0.995 ABV = 5.5%

Kit Harrington of Root Sellers’ advises, "Sodium bicarbonate (baking soda), is great for knocking the acidity down and a little goes a long way! You will need to add it 1 tsp. at a time to dial in the right amount of pH."

Ingredients
4 lbs. (1.8 kg) pure cane sugar
1 tablespoon (15 mL) molasses
½ tsp. yeast nutrient
Root beer extract (quantities vary based on extract)
2-4 tsp. baking soda (added to taste)
Clean fermenting ale yeast (Champagne works well also)
2 lbs. (0.91 kg) sugar to backsweeten (added to cold keg)

Step by step
Bring sugar, molasses, and water to a boil for 15 minutes. At flame out add yeast nutrient. Once cooled to yeast pitching temperature, add the yeast and allow the temperature to rise naturally to the upper limit of the yeast’s range; you want a good and fast ferment. After 10 days, cool to near-freezing to drop out as much yeast you can. Transfer the clear finished beer into an empty corny keg and add in the root beer extract and baking soda to taste. Finally, add the sugar (dissolved in 1 qt./1 L boiling water) to backsweeten. Mix all this very well or the dense sugar syrup will drop to the bottom and make for an awkward first pint.This beer likes to be well carbonated — try 2.4-2.7 volumes — and will stay good for quite a while in a kegerator.

Hard Seltzer
Hard seltzer
5.25 gallons/20 L
OG = ~1.031FG = ~1.000
ABV = ~ 5%

Neutral Base Ingredients
21 L reverse osmosis (RO) or distilled water
4.5 g gypsum (adjusts calcium concentration to 50 ppm)
1.65 kg cane sugar
11.5 g packet SafAle US-05 or other neutral yeast strain
2.5 g Yeastex 82 yeast nutrient added with yeast pitch
2.5 g diammonium phosphate (DAP) added with yeast pitch
2.5 g Yeastex 82 yeast nutrient added 36–48 hours after yeast pitch
2.5 g diammonium phosphate (DAP) added 36–48 hours after yeast pitch

Flavorings
2.8 mL lime extract added after CO2 bubbling (if used) and carbonation
2.8 mL lemon extract after CO2 bubbling (if used) and carbonation
420 mL pulp-free orange juice (single-strength, not from concentrate) after CO2 bubbling (if used) and carbonation
14 g citric acid powder after CO2 bubbling (if used) and carbonation

Step by step
Add water and sugar to kettle, turn on heat, and stir to dissolve sugar. Check solution strength and adjust as necessary; the pre-boil gravity should be ~1.031 OG (7.6 °Plato). Continue heating until solution is boiling and boil for 20 minutes. Check solution strength and dilute as necessary with RO or distilled water. Cool to 64 °F (18 °C) and transfer to fermenter. Add yeast and first addition of nutrients. Aeration is not required for first use of most dried yeast strains, including US-05, due to high glycogen content related to propagation conditions (https://fermentis.com/en/tips-n-tricks/questions-and-answers/). Feel free to aerate as normal if this suggestion seems too unusual. Other common yeasts that are popular for seltzer production are Champagne yeast and distillers yeast.

Fermentation should begin within about 12 hours. The second nutrient addition is added once fermentation has really kicked off and the gravity has dropped by about 0.008 OG; this should be about 36–48 hours after yeast pitching. When fermentation is complete (5–7 days after yeast pitch — FG will depend on yeast and nutrients but should be around 1.000), cool to 32 °F (0 °C) (or as cold as possible at home) and hold cold to permit yeast sedimentation.

Commercially-produced seltzers are clarified by filtration and/or centrifugation, but most homebrewers do not have filters. Part of the seltzer appeal is clarity, therefore, filtration is recommended when going for a facsimile of the real McCoy. The good news is that hard seltzer is easy to clarify using a cartridge filter. But you could also go the Cloudy Claw route and skip this step. Whatever you decide with respect to filtration, transfer the seltzer into a keg and carbonate to 2.8–3.0 volumes. Bottle or keg conditioning is not typical for hard seltzer. Taste the seltzer base to determine if aroma stripping is needed.

Sulfur off-flavors are fairly common with hard seltzers. Carbon dioxide bubbling can be used to strip these unpleasant rotten-egg and burnt-match aromas from hard seltzer. Just make sure to vent the keg during bubbling to allow these volatiles to escape. Nutrient adjustments and/or yeast strain selection on future batches can be made to help dial in the process. The trial and error nature of this process is the primary reason that many commercial seltzer producers select a yeast/nutrient blend designed for these intentionally bland bases.

The last step is to add the flavor additions. Dissolve the citric acid powder in the orange juice and add it along with the lemon and lime aromas. Slowly release the pressure on the keg, open the top while flushing the headspace with CO2, and add the flavorings. Quickly closing the lid and re-pressurizing the headspace will minimize loss of carbonation. The orange juice in this recipe is intended to provide a slight haze, so if you choose not to filter, the juice will complement the haze of the seltzer.

Harpoon Brewery: English Style Old Ale
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.085 FG = 1.020
IBU = 62 SRM = 17 ABV = 8.5%

Inspired by the sustaining winter offerings of many English breweries, this complex and malty brew is marked by significant alcohol warmth, balanced bitterness, biscuit/roasted undertones, and sublime mouthfeel.

Ingredients
16 lbs. (7.25 kg) 2-row pale malt
7 oz. (0.2 kg) biscuit malt
7 oz. (0.2 kg) crystal malt (30 °L)
6 oz. (0.17 kg) aromatic malt
2 oz. (57 g) chocolate malt
2 oz. (57 g) black malt
16.5 AAU Challenger hops (60 min.) (2 oz./56 g at 8.25% alpha acids)
1.25 AAU Fuggle hops (15 min.) (0.25 oz./7 g at 5% alpha acids)
2.4 AAU East Kent Golding hops (0 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 4.8% alpha acids)
1⁄2 tsp. yeast nutrient (15 min.)
White Labs WLP007 (Dry English Ale) or Wyeast 1028 (London Ale) or Lallemand Nottingham Ale yeast
3⁄4 cup (150 g) dextrose (if priming)

Step by Step
This is a single step infusion mash. Mix the crushed grain with 5.5 gallons (20.7 L) of 172 °F (78 °C) water to stabilize at 155 °F (68 °C) for 60 minutes. Sparge slowly with 175 °F (79 °C) water. Collect approximately 6.5 gallons (25 L) of wort runoff to boil for 90 minutes, adding hops and yeast nutrient as indicated. Cool the wort to 68 °F (20 °C). Pitch your yeast and aerate the wort heavily. Hold at 68 °F (20 °C) until fermentation is complete. Transfer to a carboy, avoiding any splashing to prevent aerating the beer. Let the beer condition for one week and then bottle or keg.

Extract with grains option: Substitute the 2-row pale malt in the all-grain recipe with 9.9 lbs. (4.5 kg) Muntons light liquid malt extract and 10 oz. (0.3 kg.) light dried malt extract. Steep the crushed grain in 5 gallons (19 L) of water at 155 °F (68 °C) for 30 minutes. Remove grains from the wort and rinse with 2 quarts (1.9 L) of hot water. Add the liquid and dry malt extracts and bring to a boil. Follow the remaining portion of the all-grain recipe.

First brewed by Harpoon in 1988, this beer has become a New England seasonal classic. Cinnamon and nutmeg dominate the aroma. The taste is a rich combination of the holiday spices and the hearty malt backbone. There is a mild sweetness to the finish along with the lingering flavor of the spices.

Ingredients
9.33 lbs. (4.2 kg) 2-row malt
2 lbs. (0.91 kg) crystal malt (90 °L)
0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) caramalt (15 °L)
2 oz. (57 g) black barley
6.25 AAU Clusters hops (60 min.) (1.25 oz./35 g at 5% alpha acids)
1/4 tsp. cinnamon
1/8 tsp. nutmeg
Wyeast 1968 (London ESB) or White Labs WLP002 (English Ale) yeast
3/4 cups (150 g) dextrose (if priming)

Step by Step
Mash the grains at 154 °F (68 °C) for 60 minutes. Mash out, vorlauf, and then sparge at 170 °F (77 °C) to collect enough wort to result in 5 gallons (19 L) after a 90-minute boil. Boil 90 minutes, adding hops at times indicated. Cool, aerate, and pitch yeast. Ferment at 70 °F (21 °C). After fermentation is complete, add cinnamon and nutmeg in secondary. Bottle or keg as usual one week later.

Extract with grains option:
Reduce the 2-row pale malt in the all-grain recipe to 0.5 lbs. (0.23 kg) and add 1.66 lbs. (0.75 kg) light dried malt extract and 4.25 lbs. (1.9 kg) light liquid malt extract. Begin by heating 2 gallons (7.6 L) of water in your brewpot. Steep specialty grains for 30–45 minutes at 154 °F (68 °C) in 1 gallon (4 L) a separate pot. After steeping, remove bag and let drip dry for a minute. Then add "grain tea" and dried malt extract to brewpot. Bring to a boil, add hops and boil for 60 minutes. With 15 minutes left in the boil, add liquid malt extract, stirring well to ensure it dissolves completely. After boil, cool wort and siphon to fermenter. Add water to make 5 gallons (19 L).

(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.051 FG = 1.010
IBU = 25 SRM = 4 ABV = 5.5%

A blonde ale fermented like a lager. Nowaday is fermented at lower
temperatures, including an additional lagering step, resulting in a crisp 5.5% ABV refresher of a beer with very low ester character.

Ingredients
9.5 lbs. (4.3 kg) Pilsner malt
1 lb. (0.45 kg) caramel malt (10 °L)
4.3 AAU Nugget hops (60 min.) (0.33 oz./9 g at 13% alpha acids)
5.4 AAU Hallertau Mittelfrüh hops (10 min.) (1.25 oz./35 g at 4.3% alpha acids)
2 oz. (57 g) Hallertau Mittelfrüh hops (0 min.)
1 oz. (28 g) Czech Saaz hops (0 min.)
Wyeast 3463 (Forbidden Fruit), White Labs WLP400 (Belgian Wit Ale), Imperial Yeast B44 (Whiteout), or SafAle K-97 yeast
3⁄4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by step
Heat 15.8 qts. (14.9 L) of strike water to 162 °F (72 °C) and mix with grains. The mash should stabilize at about 149 °F (65 °C). Hold at this temperature for 60 minutes, then raise temperature to mash out at about 168 °F (76 °C), either by infusion of boiling water, decoction, or other means. Vorlauf until wort runs clear then begin the sparge process. Collect 7 gallons (26.5 L) and bring to a boil. Total boil time is 75 minutes, adding additions as indicated. After boil is complete turn off the heat, add whirlpool hops, and give a long stir to create a whirlpool. Rest for 15 minutes.

Chill the wort to 50 °F (10 °C). There should be about 5.5 gallons (21 L) of wort in your fermenter. Add yeast and aerate wort if using liquid yeast. Place your fermenter in a cool place in the 50–55 °F (10–12 °C) range. On day five, conduct a diacetyl rest by raising the temperature to around 70 °F (21 °C) for a couple of days.

Once terminal gravity has been reached place the beer in a refrigerator or cold fermentation chamber to get the beer as cold as possible without freezing. Allow at least one week for the lagering period. Bottle or keg after lagering is complete, targeting a carbonation level of 2.55 v/v.

(5 gallons/19 L, extract with grains)
OG = 1.051 FG = 1.010
IBU = 25 SRM = 4.5 ABV = 5.5%

Ingredients
5.75 lbs. (3 kg) Pilsen dried malt extract
1 lb. (0.45 kg) caramel malt (10 °L)
4.3 AAU Nugget hops (60 min.) (0.33 oz./9 g at 13% alpha acids)
5.4 AAU Hallertau Mittelfrüh hops (10 min.) (1.25 oz./35 g at 4.3% alpha acids)
2 oz. (57 g) Hallertau Mittelfrüh hops (0 min.)
1 oz. (28 g) Czech Saaz hops (0 min.)
Wyeast 3463 (Forbidden Fruit), White Labs WLP400 (Belgian Wit Ale), Imperial Yeast B44 (Whiteout), or SafAle K-97 yeast
3⁄4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by step
Place caramel malt into a steeping bag and submerge in 2.5 gallons (9.5 L) of water at or near 155 °F (68 °C). (Reaching an exact, specific temperature is not required as there is no enzymatic conversion happening in this recipe. Just make sure it doesn’t exceed 170 °F/77 °C while steeping to avoid tannin extraction.) After 10 minutes of steeping, rinse the grain bag with 170 °F (77°C) water to top up to 6.5 gallons (24.6 L), remove bag, then boil. (If your brew kettle doesn’t allow for that large of a volume, rinse the grain bag with another gallon/4 L of water, remove bag, then raise to a boil.) When boil is achieved, take the kettle off the flame and slowly add the extract while stirring. Return to the heat source and boil for 60 minutes, adding the hops as indicated. After boil is complete turn off the heat, add whirlpool hops, and give a long stir to create a whirlpool. Rest for 15 minutes.

Chill the wort to 50 °F (10 °C). If you brewed a smaller volume, top off fermenter with pre-chilled water. In either case, the goal is to collect 5.5 gallons (21 L) of wort in your fermenter. Add yeast and aerate wort if using liquid yeast. Place your fermenter in a cool place in the 50–55 °F (10–12 °C) range. On day five, conduct a diacetyl rest by raising the temperature to around 70 °F (21 °C) for a couple of days. 

Once terminal gravity has been reached place the beer in a refrigerator or cold fermentation chamber to get the beer as cold as possible without freezing. Allow at least one week for the lagering period. Bottle or keg after lagering is complete, targeting a carbonation level of 2.55 v/v.

Step by Step
Use soft or low mineral content water to help accentuate the malty aspects of this beer. With a 1.5 qts./lb. (3.1 L/kg) water-to-grist ratio, target a mash temperature of 147 °F (64 °C). Perform a single infusion mash for 60 minutes or until proper enzymatic conversion has occurred. Sparge with 170 °F (76 °C) water to collect 6.5 gallons (24.6 L) of wort.

Boil for 60 minutes, adding hops and fining agents as indicated. At flameout, add the hops then give the wort a long stir to create a whirlpool and let settle. After about 20 minutes chill the wort to 70 °F (21°C) and transfer to the primary fermenter. Aerate thoroughly and pitch plenty of healthy yeast. Ferment at 70 °F (21 °C) until reaching a gravity of 1.024 and then allow temperature to rise to 75 °F (24 °C) until terminal gravity of 1.010 is reached, usually within 7 to 10 days.

Transfer off dead yeast/trub and add dry hops. After 48 hours drop beer temperature to 33 °F (1 °C) and lager for a minimum of 5 days. Keg or bottle, targeting 2.6 volumes of CO2.

Ingredients
6.6 lbs. (3 kg) Maris Otter liquid malt extract
0.3 lb. (0.14 kg) Weyermann Carafoam® malt
1.8 lbs. (0.82 kg) cane sugar
2.4 AAU Simcoe® hops (60 min.) (0.18 oz./5 g at 13.2% alpha acids)

1/2 tsp. yeast nutrient (10 min.)
SafAle US-05, Wyeast 1056 (American Ale), or White Labs WLP001 (California Ale) yeast
¾ cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
You could try to do a partial mash and use some of the pale ale and light Munich malt, but with this recipe we opted to start with Maris Otter liquid malt extract and make sure the beer will properly dry out by adding 20% cane sugar.

Starting with 4 gallons (15 L) of soft brewing water, steep the crushed grains as the temperature warms up to 165 °F (74 °C). Remove from heat and add the liquid malt extract. Return to heat once the extract is fully dissolved. Boil for 60 minutes, adding hops, yeast nutrients, and fining agents as indicated (do not skip yeast nutrients!). At flameout, add the hops and sugar, then give the wort a long stir to create a whirlpool and let settle. After about 20 minutes chill the wort to 70 °F (21 °C) and transfer to the primary fermenter, then top up to 5 gallons (19 L). Aerate thoroughly and pitch plenty of healthy yeast.

Ferment at 70 °F (21 °C) until reaching a gravity of 1.024 and then allow temperature to rise to 75 °F (24 °C) until terminal gravity of 1.010 is reached, usually within 7 to 10 days.

Transfer off dead yeast/trub and add dry hops. After 48 hours drop beer temperature to 33 °F (1 °C) and lager for a minimum of 5 days. Keg or bottle, targeting 2.6 volumes of CO2.

Haystack Wheat
Haystack Wheat
(5 gallons/19 L, partial mash)
OG = 1.059 FG = 1.012
IBU = 1 SRM = 5 ABV = 6.3%

Ingredients
4 oz. (113 g) acidulated malt
2 lbs. (0.91 kg) Belgian Pilsner malt
2 lbs. (0.91 kg) Belgian wheat malt
0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) light crystal malt (20° to 30° L)
0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) flaked wheat
4 lbs. (1.8 kg) wheat dried malt extract
0.5 AAU Saaz hop pellets (15 min.) (0.15 oz./4 g at 3.6% alpha acids)
1 gram spice blend (see Step by Step below)
1 qt. yeast slurry (see note below)
7/8 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Prepare your spice mix. I recommend equal parts coriander, cumin, ginger, wintergreen, and star anise; ground and mixed thoroughly. Heat 7 qts. (6.6 L) water to 162 °F (74 °C). Add crushed malts and flaked wheat to mash water. Hold at 153 °F (67 °C) for 60 min. Remove grains and wash with 2 gal. (7.6 L) water at about 168 °F (76 °C). Add dried malt extract to the kettle and bring to a boil. Total boil is 60 min adding hops for the final 15 minutes of the boil. Remove from heat and add the spice mix. Give the wort a stir to create a whirlpool and let settle for 15 minutes.

Cool and pour into fermenter. Top off with enough water to make 5.25 gal (20 L). Aerate well! At 70 °F (21 °C) or so, pitch yeast. Ferment cool (65 °F/18 °C)) for two weeks, rack to secondary if you prefer, and condition for two more weeks near 55 °F (13 °C). Prime with corn sugar and bottle or keg and force carbonate.

All-grain version:
Mash 5.5 lbs. (2.5 kg) each wheat and Pilsner malt, plus the same amounts of acidulated, crystal, and flaked wheat, same temperature and time but increase mash water to 4 gal. (15.1 L), and sparge water to 5 gal. (19 L). Time your boil to reduce to 5.25 gal. (20 L).

Extract with grains version:
Steep the crystal malt in 3 gal. (11 L) of water, heating gradually to 170 °F (77 °C), then remove grains. If you can, add 1 tsp. 88% lactic acid. Increase the wheat dried malt extract to 6.5 lbs (3 kg).

Malts:
In this recipe I prefer to use Belgian malts such as Castle as they give a fuller, richer malt profile than their German counterparts. But use what you can find; you won’t be far off.

Spices:
The blend of equal parts coriander, cumin, ginger, wintergreen, and star anise; ground and mixed thoroughly; is a balanced one, especially if used in moderation. It is very easy to overdo. If you really object to one of the spices, leave it out.

Yeast:
Because this is more or less a Belgian recipe, I prefer to use a Belgian wit yeast. Wyeast has two strains of Belgian wheat beer yeast, 3944, which is better suited to a real "witbier" — which this is not — and 3942, softer, less acidic and, I think, perfect for this recipe. An American wheat strain such as 1010 could also be used for this recipe for a cleaner yeast profile. Avoid using a Bavarian or Weihenstephan wheat strains as they are too fruity, phenolic, and estery for this recipe.

While originally brewed with a wit yeast, I thought a saison yeast might play nicely in the mix as well. The pepper hints from the Saaz and grains of paradise melded nicely while the orange provide a slight citrus character.

Ingredients
4 lbs. (1.81 kg) Belgian Pilsen malt
2.5 lbs. (1.13 kg) unmalted white wheat
0.5 lbs. (0.23 kg) flaked oat
3.5 AAU Czech Saaz hops (60 min.) (1 oz./28g 3.5% alpha acid)
1.75 AAU Czech Saaz hops (15 min.) (0.5 oz/14 g 3.5% alpha acid)
1 oz. sweet orange peel, zested (0 min.)
1/4 tsp. (1 g) grains of paradise (0 min.)
Belgian Wit, Saison or Abbey Ale yeast
3/4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Heat 2.1 qt. (2.0 L) of strike water to 138 °F (59 °C). Dough-in grain at 113 °F (45 °C) for 10 minutes. Raise temp of mash to 136 °F (58 °C) by the addition of 3.15 qt. (3.0 L) of boiling water, hold 5 minutes.

Drop in stuykmanden and draw off about 1 qt. (1 L) of liquid. Heat the drawn off or turbid portion to between 180 - 212 °F (82 - 100 °C). Raise temperature of mash to 150 °F (66 °C) by the addition of 4.4 qts. (4.2 L) of boiling water and hold 30 minutes. Drop in stuykmanden and draw off about 1 gal. (3.8 L) of liquid into the turbid portion. Re-raise temperature of turbid portion to between 180 - 212 °F (82 - 100 °C).

Raise temperature of mash to 162 °F (72 °C) by the addition of 4.4 qt. (4.2 L) of boiling water and hold 20 min. Drop temperature of turbid mash to 176 °F (80 °C). Drain the free liquid in the mash tun to the kettle as if you were batch sparging. Gently pour the turbid portion over the grains to bring the mash temperature to 167 °F (75 °C), hold for 20 minutes. Lauter as normal. Boil 60 minutes and add spices at flameout. Let settle for 5 minutes before chilling. Ferment on the warmer end of your yeast strain’s range.

(5 gallons/19 L, extract with grains)
OG = 1.065 FG = 1.012
IBU = 17 SRM = 7ABV = 5.7%

This beer kit was created with the idea of helping to raise funds for Harrisburg River Rescue. They are the beneficiary of all funds raised during Harrisburg Beer Week (HBW). Scotzin Brothers is already the sponsor for HBW Battle of the Homebrewers, but we were looking to do more. A beer kit seemed like a good fit. Our store manager Fran Ott is on a big Australian and New Zealand hop kick right now, so he created a kit with those as his starting point. The beer is an easy drinking IPA with a restrained bitterness. The Australian and New Zealand hops impart bright flavors and aromas of tropical and citrus fruits. We think of it as sunshine in a glass, a perfect beer for summer.

Ingredients
6.6 lbs. (3 kg) light liquid malt extract
1 lb.(0.45 kg) light dried malt extract
8 oz. (0.23 kg) light Munich malt
8 oz. (0.23 kg) Golden Naked Oats®
4 oz. (113 g) honey malt
4 oz. (113 g) flaked oats
4.8 AAU Summer hops (60 min.) (1 oz./28 g at 4.8% alpha acids)
1 oz. (28 g) RakauTM hops (hopstand)
1 oz. (28 g) KohatuTM hops (hopstand)
1 oz. (28 g) Galaxy hops (hopstand)
1 oz. (28 g) RakauTM hops (dry hop)
1 oz. (28 g) KohatuTM hops (dry hop)
1 oz. (28 g) Galaxy hops (dry hop)
Imperial Yeast A38 (Juice) or White Labs WLP066 (London Fog Ale) or LalBrew New England yeast
3⁄4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by step
Mill grains and place into a grain bag. Steep grains in 2.5 gallons (9.5 L) of 152 °F (67 °C) water for 20 minutes. Remove bag and let drain into the kettle. Bring wort to a boil and then remove kettle from the burner. Add the liquid and dried malt extracts while stirring, being careful not to scorch the bottle of the kettle. When the extract is dissolved, return to a boil and add Summer hops. Boil for 60 minutes.

After the boil is complete, cool wort to 180 °F (82 °C). Pause cooling and add hopstand hops. Stir the hops into the wort, then cover the kettle and let sit for 20 minutes. Resume cooling wort to 70 °F (21 °C). Add water (64 to 70 °F/18 to 21 °C) to bring wort up to 5 gallons (19 L). Transfer wort to fermenter and stir in yeast.

After 5–7 days take gravity reading and transfer to secondary fermenter with dry hops. Keep beer on hops for 5–7 days, then package. Carbonate to 2.5 volumes.

0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) crystal malt (20° L)
0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) crystal malt (40° L)
2 oz. (57 g) chocolate malt
3 cups fresh or 1-2 cup dry heather flowers (1/2 added for 60 minutes, 1/2 added at end of boil)
4.2 AAU Fuggles hops (60 min.) (1 oz./28 g of 4.2% alpha acids) (optional)
0.5 oz. (14 g) Fuggles hops (0 min.) (optional)
1 pt. starter of Scottish Ale yeast (Wyeast 1728 or equivalent)
2/3 cup corn sugar for priming

Step by Step
Mash grain in 13.3 quarts (12.6 L) of water at 150 °F (66 °C) for 60 minutes. Sparge with enough 168 °F (76 °C) water to collect 6.5 gallons (24.6 L) of wort. Total boil time is 90 minutes, aim to turn off the boil with 5.25 gallons (20 L) of wort in the kettle. After 30 minutes of boil, add first addition of heather flowers and if you want, the first addition of hops. Continue boil for remaining 60 minutes. Add second addition of heather flowers and create a whirlpool or use a hopback of flowers. If you want, the second addition of hops should be added at flameout as well. Cool to 69 °F (20 °C) to pitch starter. Oxygenate-aerate well.

Ferment at 69 °F (20 °C) for seven days then rack to secondary fermenter. Continue fermentation for seven more days until gravity is about 3° Plato (1.012) or fermentation is finished. Let settle. Rack, prime and bottle. Age seven more days before drinking.

Extract with grains option:
Substitute the pale ale malt with 6.6 lbs. (3 kg) English pale malt extract syrup and cut the Carapils® malt down to 0.5 lb. (0.23 kg). Other ingredients remain the same. Start with 5 gallons of 150°F water. Steep crushed grain for 30 minutes. Sparge grains with enough 170°F water to make 5.5 gallons. Heat to boiling and add extract syrup. Total boil will be 60 minutes. At beginning of boil add first addition of heather flowers. Continue for remaining 60 minutes. Whirlpool and add second addition of heather flowers or use a hopback. Cool to 69°F to pitch starter. Oxygenate-aerate well. Follow fermentation schedule above.

(6 gallons/23 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.050 FG = 1.009
IBU = 12 SRM = 5 ABV = 5.3%

Ingredients
6.5 lbs. (2.9 kg) malted wheat
4 lbs. (1.8 kg) Europils malt (Canadian version of Pilsner)
1.5 lbs. (0.7 kg) Vienna malt
4 oz. (112 g) Caramunich® malt
3.2 AAU Tettnanger leaf hops (60 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 6.5% alpha acids)
0.6 AAU Saaz leaf hops (60 min.) (0.25 oz./7 g at 2.5% alpha acids)
1 pk. Wyeast 3068 (Weihenstephan Weizen Yeast)

Step-by-step
Add 1 tsp. lactic acid to 10 gallons of very soft water for the mash and sparge. This was a single decoction mash. Infuse 3.6 gallons (13.7 L) water at 143 ºF (62 ºC) to do a protein rest at 120 ºF (49 ºC) for 30 minutes. Then remove 40% of the mash and raise to 150 ºF (66 ºC) and hold for 30 minutes. Raise the decoction to boiling and boil for 15 minutes.

Add back to the mash and adjust the mash temp to 150 ºF (66 ºC) for 60 minutes. Add 3 gallons (11.4 L) boiling water and mash out at 168 ºF (76 ºC) for 30 minutes. Sparge with 170 ºF (77 ºC) water down to 1.000 OG hit (1.013 ambient). Ferment at 68 ºF (20 ºC). With this beer, I bottled half the batch after 1 week, and added 1 quart (~1 L) of sour cherries to the remaining 2 gallons (7.6 L). The cherry brew was pretty good, but not as good as the straight Hefeweizen. The sour, tart taste competes with the banana/clove esters of the Weihenstephan yeast. Enjoy!

This classic Dutch lager available in green bottles across the world is still brewed using the same recipe since first made available in 1873.

Ingredients
8 lbs. (3.6 kg) Pilsner malt
5 oz. (0.14 kg) Weyermann acidulated malt
4 oz. (0.11 kg) Carapils malt
2.4 lbs. (1.1 kg) corn grits
2 tsp. Irish moss
1/4 tsp. yeast nutrients
6.6 AAU Magnum hops (60 min.) (0.4 oz./12 g at 16% alpha acids)
0.13 oz. (3.5 g) Saaz hops (15 min.)
Wyeast 2024 (Danish Lager) or White Labs WLP850 (Copenhagen Lager) yeast (3 qt./~3 L yeast starter at SG 1.030-1.040)
2 tsp. Polyclar (fining agent)
1 gallon (3.8 L) deaerated water (for blending)
1 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Heat 12 quarts (11 L) of water to 142 °F (61 °C) in your kettle. Set aside corn grits and one pound (0.45 kg) of Pilsner malt. Stir remaining crushed grains into hot water and mash at 131 °F (55 °C). Make cereal mash by combining 5 quarts (4.7 L) of water with grits and crushed Pilsner malt. While main mash is resting, begin heating cereal mash to 158 °F (70 °C). Hold cereal mash at 158 °F (70 °C) for 5 minutes, then heat to a boil, stirring constantly. Boil cereal mash for 15 minutes. After main mash has rested 15 minutes, begin heating it to 140 °F (60 °F). Stir this mash as well. (If you don’t have a brewing partner, save yourself some headaches and make the cereal mash immediately before mashing in the main mash.) Hold main mash at 140 °F (60 °C) for 15 minutes. Stir cereal mash into main mash and adjust temperature to 152 °F (67 °C). Hold at this temperature for 45 minutes, then heat to 170 °F (77 °C). Transfer mash to lauter tun (and rinse out your kettle). Recirculate wort for 20 minutes, then begin running off wort. Heat sparge water to 190 °F (88 °C) and monitor the temperature of the top of the grain bed. When it reaches 170 °F (77 °C), add cool water to sparge water to cool it to 170 °F (77 °C). Collect wort until the specific gravity of the final runnings is below 1.008 or the pH climbs above 5.8. Add enough water so you will yield 5 gallons of wort after a 90 minutes boil — around 6.5–7 gallons (25–26 L) for a reasonable evaporation rate. Add a pinch of calcium (CaCl2 or gypsum) at the beginning of the boil. Add hops at times indicated in recipe and Irish moss and yeast nutrients with 15 minutes left in the boil. After boil, cool quickly and transfer to fermenter. Aerate and pitch yeast sediment from yeast starter. Ferment at 53 °F (12 °C) until terminal gravity is within 3 gravity points of final gravity. Let temperature rise to 60 °F (16 °C) and let rest until diacetly is gone. Cool to 30–40 °F (-1.1–4.4 °C) and lager for 4–6 weeks. Add 2 tsp Polyclar to beer the night before you keg or bottle it. Dilute 5 gallons (19 L) of base beer to 6 gallons (23 L) of finished beer by blending base beer with 1 gallon (3.8 L) of deaerated water. Package in keg or green bottles.

Partial mash option: Replace all of the malts and corn grits in the all-grain recipe with 2 lbs. (0.9 kg) 2-row Pilsner malt, 13.6 oz. (0.39 kg) Laaglander light dried malt extract, 2.5 lbs. (1.13 kg) Coopers light liquid malt extract, and 1 lb. 7 oz. (0.65 kg) brewers corn syrup. Reduce Magnum hop addition to 5.4 AAU (0.33 oz./9.6 g) and the Saaz hop addition to 0.11 oz. (3.1 g). Put crushed Pilsner malt in a nylon steeping bag. In a 2-gallon (8-L) kitchen pot, heat 3 quarts (~3 L) of water to 169 °F (76 °C), turn off heat and dunk steeping bag. Steep grains for 45 minutes at 158 °F (70 °C). While grains are steeping, heat 2 gallons (7.6 L) of water to 180 °F (82 °C) in your brewpot. When steep is over, add 2 quarts (2 L) of hot water from kettle to the "grain tea" in the steeping pot. Remove grain bag and place in colander over brewpot. Pour the diluted "grain tea" through the grains in the steeping bag. Discard grain bag, add dried malt extract and corn syrup to the liquid in the kettle and bring to a boil. Once a boil is reached, wait until the foam subsides and then add hops and begin timing the 60-minute boil. With 15 minutes left in boil, add Saaz hops, Irish moss and yeast nutrients, then turn off heat and stir in the liquid malt extract. Resume heating once the extract is completely dissolved. After boil, cool wort quickly and transfer to fermenter. Add water in fermenter to make 5 gallons (19 L). Follow the remaining portion of the all-grain recipe.

OG = 1.053 FG = 1.015
IBU = 30 SRM = 7 ABV = 5%

Ingredients
4.5 lbs. (2 kg) extra light dried malt extract
1.25 lbs. (0.57 kg) Munich malt
1.25 lbs. (0.57 kg) Vienna malt
3.5 oz. (100 g) melanoidin malt
0.5 oz. (14 g) chocolate malt
4.6 AAU Nugget hops (60 min.) (0.35 oz./10 g at 13% alpha acids)
7 AAU Cluster hops (5 min.) (1 oz./28 g at 7% alpha acids)
13.75 AAU Cascade hops (5 min.) (2.5 oz./71 g at 5.5% alpha acids)
SafAle US-05, Mangrove Jack’s M44 (West Coast Ale), or White Labs WLP001 (California Ale) yeast
¾ cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Place crushed grains in a large muslin bag. Submerge grain bag in 1 gallon (4 L) of water at 162 °F (62 °C) to settle temperature at 149 °F (65 °C) and try to hold at this temperature for 60 minutes. Slowly wash grains with 1 gallon (4 L) of hot water. Add another gallon (4 L) of hot water to the wort and add half of the dried malt extract. Stir until all the extract is dissolved then bring wort to boil. This is a standard 60-minute boil. Add Nugget hops at start of boil. Add Cluster and Cascade hops and second half of the dried malt extract five minutes from flameout. After the boil is finished, cool wort down to 65 °F (18 °C) and transfer to fermentation vessel, then top up with water to 5 gallons (19 L). Add yeast as directed, a small yeast starter is often recommended if using a liquid strain.

Ferment at 66 °F (19 °C) until signs of fermentation are complete. Let condition in the 60s °F (upper teens °C) for one week prior to packaging. Carbonate to 2.5 volumes CO2 either in bottle or keg.

Tasting Notes:
Heisler has everything that comes to mind when I think about an American pale ale. The Nugget imparts those resiny, pine, herbal background notes and the grapefruit character of the Cascade bursts through and takes center stage.

The beer has a velvety mouthfeel from the more complex malt bill. Caramel and toffee notes come from the Vienna, Munich, and melanoidin malts and are a pleasant addition and not cloying at all.

Not too bitter, nothing too assertive within this beer to stop it being a great session beer that could catch on worldwide, no matter which universe you are a part of.

Helles Belles
(5 gallons/19 L, partial mash)
OG = 1.053 FG = 1.013
IBU = 26 SRM = 5 ABV = 5.3%

Ingredients
3 lbs. (1.4 kg) Pilsner malt
0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) Vienna malt
0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) Carapils malt
3 lbs. (1.4 kg) extra light dried malt extract
1 lb. (0.45 kg) Munich dried malt extract
8 AAU Tettnanger hop pellets (45 min.) (2 oz./57 g at 4% alpha acid)
2 cups shelled whole, unsalted pistachios
4 oz. (120 mL) grain alcohol or vodka
Wyeast 2308 (Munich Lager) or White Labs WLP838 (Southern German Lager) yeast
3/4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
A few weeks before you brew, finely crush pistachios and soak in vodka in a tightly sealed jar. Heat 1.5 gal. (5.7 L) water to 167 °F (75 °C), and add crushed grains to water in pot. Mash should settle near 156 °F (69 °C). Hold 60 min at this temperature. Remove grains and place in a colander. Wash grains with 2 gal. (7.6 L) of water at 168 °F (76 °C). Add dried malt extract to the kettle while off heat and stir until it is all dissolved. Bring wort to a boil and boil 30 min, then add the hops.

Boil 45 min. more for a total boil of 75 min. Remove from heat and cool. Top off in fermenter to 5.25 gal. (20 L) with water. A 68 °F (20 °C), pitch yeast slurry and cool overnight to 50 °F (10 °C). Ferment near 50 °F (10 °C) for 10 days, then rack to secondary if you prefer. Add half of the liquid from the pistachio jar (strain particles out, returning them to the jar) and chill to 38 °F (3 °C). Lager at this temperature for six weeks. Prime with corn sugar or keg the beer and add the remaining pistachio tincture (straining out particles) and bottle.

Brewing Notes:

All-grain brewers: Instead of the dried malt extract, mash with 8 lbs. (3.6 kg) Pilsner, 1.5 lbs. (0.68 kg) Munich, and 1.5 lbs. (0.68 kg) Vienna malts in 4 gal. (15.2 L) water (same temperatures, same time) and sparge with 4 gal. (15.1 L) water. Plan boil to condense to 5.25 gal. (20 L) and hop as above.

Extract with grains version: Omit the Pilsner and Vienna malts. Steep the Carapils malt in 3 gallons (11 L) in kettle until water reaches 170 °F (77 °C), then remove. Use 5 lbs. (2.23 kg) extra light dried malt extract and the same amount of Munich dried malt extract. Follow hopping and boiling schedule as above.

And sure, you could use any nuts you like in this recipe.

1 lb. (0.45 kg) Munich malt (10 °L)
1 lb. (0.45 kg) flaked oats
6.5 AAU Nugget hops (60 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 13% alpha acids)
8.3 AAU Cascade hops (15 min.) (1.5 oz./43 g at 5.5% alpha acids)
1.5 oz. (43 g) Comet hops (0 min.)
1.5 oz. (43 g) Azacca® hops (0 min.)
1.5 oz. (43 g) Comet hops (dry hop)
1.5 oz. (43 g) Azacca® hops (dry hop)
0.25 oz. (7 g) coriander (0 min.)
Wyeast 3463 (Forbidden Fruit), White Labs WLP400 (Belgian Wit Ale), Imperial Yeast B44 (Whiteout), or SafAle K-97 yeast
3⁄4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by step
Heat 12.7 qts. (12 L) of strike water to 162 °F (72 °C). Mix with grains. The mash should stabilize at about 149 °F (65 °C). Hold at this temperature for 60 minutes, then raise temperature to mash out at about 168 °F (76 °C), either by infusion of boiling water, decoction, or other means. Vorlauf until wort runs clear then begin the sparge process. Collect 6.5 gallons (24.6 L) and bring to a boil. Total boil time is 60 minutes, adding hops as indicated. After boil is complete, turn off the heat, add the whirlpool additions (with the coriander bagged) and give a long stir to create a whirlpool. Steep for 10 minutes and remove coriander. Rest for an additional 10 minutes.

Chill the wort to 68 °F (20 °C). If you end up with a smaller volume, top off fermenter with pre-chilled water. The goal is to collect 5.5 gallons (21 L) of wort in the fermenter. Add yeast and aerate wort if using a liquid yeast strain. Place your fermenter in a temperature-stable place in the 70–74 °F (21–23 °C) range. Add the dry hops on day four of fermentation directly into the fermenter. Bottle or keg after fermentation is complete, targeting a carbonation level of 2.55 v/v.

Step by step
Heat 2 gallons (7.6 L) of water to 157 °F (69 °C). Using a steeping bag, insert the Munich malt and flaked oats. The goal is to achieve a mash temperature of 149 °F (65 °C). Mash for at least 60 minutes or until converted. Rinse the grain bag with 170 °F (77 °C) water to top up to 6.5 gallons (24.6 L), remove bag, then boil. (If your brew kettle doesn’t allow for that large of a volume, rinse the grain bag with another gallon/4 L of water, remove bag, then raise to a boil.) When boil is achieved, take the kettle off the flame and slowly add the extract while stirring. Return to heat source and boil for 60 minutes, adding hops as indicated. After boil is complete, turn off the heat, add the whirlpool additions (with the coriander bagged) and give a long stir to create a whirlpool. Steep for 10 minutes and remove coriander. Rest for an additional 10 minutes.

Chill the wort to 68 °F (20 °C). If you brewed a smaller volume, top off fermenter with pre-chilled water. In either case, the goal is to collect 5.5 gallons (21 L) of wort.

Step by Step
Mill the grains and mix with 4.1 gallons (15.5 L) of 165 °F (74 °C) strike water to reach a mash temperature of 153 °F (67 °C). Hold this temperature for 60 minutes. Vorlauf until your runnings are clear. Sparge the grains with 2.8 gallons (10.6 L) and top up as necessary to obtain 6 gallons (23 L) of wort. Boil for 90 minutes. Add the first Columbus hop charge with 60 minutes left in the boil. Add the second Columbus hop addition, and the first Citra® addition at the end of the boil. After the boil, turn off heat and begin a vigorous whirlpool in your kettle. Let the hot wort stand for 20 minutes, then chill the wort to slightly below fermentation temperature, about 65 °F (18 °C). Aerate the wort with pure oxygen or filtered air and pitch yeast.

Ferment at 67 °F (19 °C) for 7 days. Add the dry hops and raise to 72 °F (22 °C) for three more days. Add the second round of dry hops for an additional four days (seven total days of dry hopping). Once the beer reaches terminal gravity, bottle or keg the beer and carbonate to approximately 2.5 volumes. You may want to cold-crash the beer prior to packaging to 35 °F (2 °C) for 48 hours to improve the clarity.

Tips for Success:
This beer’s recipe has undergone several evolutions, from its origins as a homebrew recipe through its development as a commercial success for Heretic. This version came directly from the desk of Chief Heretic Jamil Zainasheff. The beer relies on extensive flame out and dry hopping to achieve its signature hop nose, with only a small bittering addition 30 minutes into its 90-minute boil. It even makes use of a second dry hopping round, receiving one last blast of Citra®.

Before Jamil went pro, he wrote for Brew Your Own in his "Style Profile" column about brewing American amber (red) ale (including some early iterations of what may have become Evil Twin).

0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) Briess crystal malt (60 °L)
1.0 lb. (0.45 kg) Briess crystal malt (40 °L)
0.25 lb. (113 g) Briess Extra Special malt
9 AAU Chinook hops (60 min.) (0.75 oz./21 g of 12% alpha acid)
2.5 AAU Willamette hops (0 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g of 5.0% alpha acid)
2.9 AAU Cascade hops (0 min.) (0.5 oz. (14.7 g) of 5.8% alpha acid)
1 tsp. Irish moss
White Labs WLP001 (California Ale) or Wyeast 1056 (American Ale) yeast
O.75 cup of corn sugar (for priming)

Step by Step
Steep the crushed specialty malts in 4.8 qts. (~4.8 L L) of water at 150 ºF (66 °C) for 30 min. Rinse grains with 2.4 qts. (~2.4 L) of 170 °F (77 °C) water. Add water to make 3 gallons (11 L). Add dried malt extract and bring to a boil. Add Chinook (bittering) hops and boil for 60 min. Add liquid malt extract and Irish moss with 15 minutes left in boil. Add Willamette and Cascade hops at the end of the boil, and let steep for 10 minutes. When done, strain out the hops, add the wort to 2 gal. (7.6 L) of cool water in a sanitary fermenter and top off with cool water to 5.5 gal. (21 L). Cool the wort to 80 ºF (27 °C), heavily aerate the beer and pitch your yeast. Allow the beer to cool over the next few hours to 64-66 °F (18-19 °C), and hold at these cooler temperatures until the yeast has fermented completely. Bottle your beer, and age for two to three weeks.

All-grain version:
Replace the light syrup and powder with 7.6 lbs. (3.4 kg) Briess pale malt and increase the Munich malt to 2.75 lbs. (1.25 kg). Mash all grains at 150º F (66°C) for 60 min. to achieve high fermentability. Collect enough wort to boil for 90 minutes.

1 AAU Willamette hops (0 min.) (0.25 oz./7 g at 4.1% alpha acids)
1.4 AAU Cascade hops (0 min.) (0.25 oz./7 g at 5.5% alpha acids)
Wyeast 1056 (American Ale), White Labs WLP001 (California Ale), or SafAle US-05 yeast
¾ cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Mill the grains, then mix with 4 gallons (15.1 L) of 169 °F (76 °C) strike water to achieve a single infusion rest temperature of 152 °F (67 °C). Hold at this temperature for 60 minutes. Mashout to 170 °F (77 °C) if desired.

Vorlauf until your runnings are clear before directing them to your boil kettle. Batch or fly sparge the mash and run-off to obtain 6.5 gallons (25 L) of wort. Sparging for this beer takes 2 hours at full volume but should be quicker at home. Boil for 60 minutes, adding hops at the indicated times left in the boil. At 15 minutes left in boil, add either Irish moss or Whirlfloc as kettle fining agents.

After the boil, add the final addition of hops and whirlpool for 15 minutes before rapidly chilling the wort to 62 °F (17 °C). Pitch yeast. Fermentation begins at 62 °F (17 °C) but is raised to 70 °F (21 °C) for a diacetyl rest near the end of active fermentation.

Once primary fermentation is complete and the beer has settled, which can be hastened by cold crashing to 32 °F (0 °C), bottle or keg the beer and carbonate to approximately 2.5 volumes.

Add both extracts, with stirring, before heating to a boil. Boil for 60 minutes, adding hops at the indicated times left in the boil. At 15 minutes left in boil, add either Irish moss or Whirlfloc as fining agents.

After the boil, add the whirlpool hops indicated and whirlpool for 15 minutes before rapidly chilling the wort to 62 °F (17 °C). Pitch yeast. Fermentation begins at 62 °F (17 °C) but is raised to 70 °F (21 °C) for a diacetyl rest near the end of active fermentation.

Once primary fermentation is complete, and the beer has settled, which can be hastened by cold crashing to 32 °F (0 °C), bottle or keg the beer and carbonate to approximately 2.5 volumes.

Tips for Success:
The largest hurdle to brewing this beer is avoiding the harsh, astringent character that can come from the use of roasted malts. Also, if your mash pH is too low, you’ll end up with a thin, lifeless brew with the nuances of chocolate malt. Aim for a mash pH slightly higher than the normally acceptable range, 5.4–5.5, to circumvent both problems.

Secondly, you’ll want to make a yeast starter if using one of the liquid strains. Although the brew isn’t of the high-octane variety, without a proper pitch you’ll probably end up with slight under-attenuation and/or subtle off-flavors developing. A clean fermentation to allow the chocolate and coffee notes to shine is key here.

Step by Step
Steep the two crushed malts in 3 gallons (13.5 L) of water at 150 ºF (66 ºC) for 30 minutes. Remove grains from wort, add the malt syrup and dry malt extract and bring to a boil.

Add the Goldings hops, Hersbrucker hops, Irish moss, and boil for 60 minutes. Add the first addition of Heather tips for the last 30 minutes of the boil. There are no finishing hops in this recipe.

Now add wort to 2 gallons (9 L) cool water in a sanitary fermenter, and top off with cool water to 5.5 gallons (25 L). Cool the wort to 75º (24 ºC), aerate the beer and pitch your yeast.

Allow the beer to cool over the next few hours to 65 ºF (18 ºC) and hold at this temperature until the beer has finished fermenting. Add the last 2 ounces (56 g) of the heather tips just as you would if you were to be dry hopping, by adding them to the beer when the fermentation is done.

Let the Heather tips dry hop in the beer for about five to seven days, then bottle.

This is a single step infusion mash. Your grain bill will be 9.5 lbs (4.3 kg) British Maris Otter Pale 2-row malt and 4 oz. (113 g) British Roasted Barley. Mash crushed grains together at 150 ºF (66 ºC) for 60 minutes.

Collect approximately 7 gallons wort (32 L) to boil for 90 minutes and have a 5.5-gallon yield (25 L), allowing for racking losses later. Lower the amount of the Kent Goldings hops in the boil to 0.50 ounce (14 g) to account for higher extraction ratio of a full boil.

The remainder of the all-grain recipe is the same as the extract recipe.

Highland Holiday Ale
(5 gallons/19 L, partial mash)
OG = 1.068 FG = 1.018
IBU = 30 SRM = 22 ABV = 7%

Ingredients
3 lbs. (1.4 kg) amber dried malt extract
3 lbs. (1.4 kg) traditional dark dried malt extract
2 lbs. (0.91 kg) 2-row pale malt
3 oz. (85 g) peat smoked malt
8 oz. (227 g) extra dark crystal malt (120° L)
8 oz. (227 g) Munich malt
2 oz. (57 g) roasted barley
4 oz. (113 g) dark brown sugar
8 AAU Challenger hop pellets (90 min.) (1 oz./28 g at 8% alpha acids)
0.25 oz. (7 g) freshly grated ginger (0 min.)
0.25 oz. (7 g) dried rosemary leaves (0 min.)
Pinch fennel seeds (0 min.)
Wyeast 1728 (Scottish Ale) or Mangrove Jack's M15 (Empire Ale) or Lallemand Nottingham yeast
2/3 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Heat 1.5 gal. (5.7 L) of water to 166 °F (74 °F) and mash in the crushed pale, peated, crystal, and Munich malts along with roasted barley. Mash should settle to about 155 °F (68 °C). Hold 60 min. then wash grains with 2 gal. (7.6 L) water at 170 °F (77 °C). To the kettle add 1 gal. (4 L) of water, the dried malt extract, and the brown sugar. Bring to a boil, add Challenger pellets, and boil 90 min. Turn off the heat and steep (in a mesh bag for ease of straining) the ginger, rosemary, and fennel. Leave standing 30 min., remove herbs, and cool. Put into the fermenter and top off with water to make 5.25 gal (20 L). At 65 °F (18 °C) pitch yeast. Ferment cool (63 °F/17 °C if possible) for 10 days, rack to secondary if you so desire and condition even cooler (55 °F/13 °C) for two to three weeks. Keg and force carbonate or prime with corn sugar and bottle condition for one to three weeks.

Brewing Notes:

Extract with grains version:
Steep roasted barley, peated, and dark crystal malts as above in 3 gal. (11 L) of water, heat gradually to 170 °F (77 °F), and remove grains. Add 4 lbs. (1.8 kg) of amber and 3 lbs. (1.4 kg) of dark dried malt extract and 8 oz. (0.23 kg) dark brown sugar.

All-grain version:
Mash 11 lbs. (5 kg) pale malt, 2 lbs. (0.91 kg) Munich malt, 1 lb. (0.45 kg) dark crystal malt, 3 oz. (85 g) peat smoked malt, and 4 oz. (113 g) roasted barley at 155 °F (68 °C) for 75 minutes in 4.5 gal (17.1 L). Sparge with enough 170 °F (77 °C) water to collect 6.5 gal (24.6 L) wort in the kettle. Boil to reduce to 5.25 gal. (20 L), add hops and herbs as above.

Peat smoked malt:
Peat smoked malt is a strong flavored malt and is available at most homebrew supply shops. There is no substitute, so if you can't find it you can just leave it out. Also, it is easy to go overboard with peat smoked malt, so just word of caution if you feel like you have a heavy hand when weighing out the grains.

Herbs and variations:
Substitute heather honey (if you can find it) for the brown sugar. Or use heather flowers and/or lavender (ask your homebrew shop to get them for you) in the herb mix. Be careful with the ginger. It is meant as an accent, not a featured flavor, and a little goes a long way.

Want to play with yeast? This would be really interesting with a recultured slurry of Belhaven or Traquair's yeast. Or maybe a Belgian Trappist yeast...Hmmm.

(5.5 gallons/21 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.075 FG = 1.014
IBU = 100+ SRM = 6 ABV = 8.5%

Part of Hill Farmstead’s "Ancesteral Series," Abner was named for Brewmaster Shaun Hill’s great-grandfather, who once owned the land where the brewery now stands. Described as "aromatic and flowery, bursting with notes of citrus and pine," Abner is just one of the reasons why so many beer lovers make the pilgrimage to Vermont’s Northeast Kingdom to visit the brewery each year.

INGREDIENTS
15 lb. (6.8 kg) 2-row pale malt
0.75 lbs. (0.34 kg) caramalt (12°L)
1 lb. (0.45 kg) dextrose (10 mins.)
15.5 AAU Warrior hops (60 mins.) (1.0 oz./28 g at 15.5% alpha acids)
10.5 AAU Columbus hops (30 mins.) (0.75 oz./21 g at 14% alpha acids)
13 AAU Simcoe hops (0 mins.) (1.0 oz./28 g at 13% alpha acids)
10 AAU Centennial hops (0 mins.) (1.0 oz./28 g at 10% alpha acids)
6.5 AAU Chinook hops (0 mins.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 13% alpha acids)
7 AAU Columbus hops (0 mins.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 14% alpha acids)
3 oz. (84 g) Centennial hops (dry hop)
2 oz. (56 g) Simcoe hops (dry hop)
Wyeast 1028 (London Ale), White Labs WLP013 (London Ale), or Lallemand Nottingham yeast [~2 L starter])
1 tbsp. polyclar
2/3 cup (130 g) dextrose (if priming)

STEP BY STEP
Mash the grains at 149°F (65°C) for 45 minutes. Mash out, vorlauf, and then sparge at 170°F (77°C) to collect about 7 gallons (27 L) of wort (the goal is to get 5.5 gallons (21 L) into your fermenter). Boil for 75 minutes, adding the hops as instructed. After the boil is complete, begin a whirlpool in the kettle and let the knockout hops rest in the hot wort for at least 30 minutes before chilling. Pitch the yeast and ferment at 68°F (20°C) until the final gravity is reached, about 1 week. Add a fining agent to clear yeast from beer. Add the dry hops and let the beer sit on the dry hops for an additional 7 to 10 days. Bottle or keg as usual.

EXTRACT WITH GRAINS OPTION:
Substitute 9.9 pounds (4.5 kg) light liquid malt extract and 0.5 pounds (0.23 kg) extra light dried malt extract for the 2-row pale malt. Steep the crushed caramalt in 2 quarts (1.9 L) water at 155°F (68°C) for 20 minutes. Top off kettle to 7 gallons (27 L). Off the heat, add the liquid and dried malt extract and bring to a boil. Boil for 75 minutes, adding the hops and corn sugar as instructed in the ingredients list. Follow the remaining portion of the all-grain recipe.

Tips for Success:
Although the standard batch size for Brew Your Own recipes is 5 gallons (19 L), the goal with this recipe is to get at least 5.5 gallons (21 L) into your fermenter to compensate for the loss of wort that will occur during dry hopping. Make sure your primary fermenter has enough headspace to accommodate that much wort plus a large kräusen. Brewing with whole-flower or fresh hops (if you choose to use them for this recipe) can leave a lot of hop material behind, which in addition to reducing your final volume as mentioned earlier, can also clog up your equipment. Add your boil hops using a muslin brewing bag or a "hop spider" to make things easier.

The mouthfeel of this beer is incredible, which may mean that chlorides are one key to Shaun Hill’s success at Hill Farmstead Brewery (one key of many). To try and duplicate this in your homebrewery, start off with soft water and make sure the chloride level in your brewing water is at least 50 ppm to help boost the mouthfeel. Try experimenting with different chloride levels in test batches until you get the one you like. Also, don’t forget sulfate levels. A good starting point is 100 ppm with the addition of gypsum salt. To tweak your brewing water, download Brew Your Own’s brewing water spreadsheet, written by Vermont Pub & Brewery’s Greg Noonan: https://byo.com/resources/brewwater. No matter what type of brewer you are, carbon filtering your water or treating it overnight with Campden tablets is recommended, especially if your water comes from a town or city source that is chlorinated (as opposed to well or spring water). Adding one Campden tablet in 20 gallons (76 L) of water (left overnight) will rid your water of chlorine compounds that can lead to off-flavors in your beer.
Another huge factor in Abner, as with all pale, hoppy beers, is minimizing oxygen uptake after fermentation. When transferring your finished beer, make sure you are either flushing the receiving vessel with CO2 or using a closed transfer system. This is because hop compounds are especially sensitive to oxidation and their flavors diminish quickly when exposed to oxygen.

(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.088 FG = 1.030
IBU = 38 SRM = 55 ABV = 7.5%

Named for Brewmaster Shaun Hill’s grandfather’s brother, this porter is brewed using American malted barley, English and German roasted malts, American hops, and the Hill Farmstead house ale yeast. It features deep dark flavors of coffee and chocolate.

INGREDIENTS
13.5 lb. (6.1 kg) 2-row pale malt
1.0 lb. (0.45 kg) dextrine malt
1.25 lb. (0.57 kg) caramalt (37°L)
0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) crystal malt (90°L)
1.0 lb. (0.45 kg) chocolate malt (300°L)
1.25 lb. (0.57 kg) roasted barley (500°L)
11 AAU Columbus hops (60 mins.) (0.8 oz./23 g at 14% alpha acids)
Wyeast 1028 (London Ale), White Labs WLP013 (London Ale), or Lallemand Nottingham yeast (~2.5 L starter)
3/4 cup (150 g) dextrose (for priming)

STEP BY STEP
When crushing the grains, keep the dark roasted grains (crystal 90°L, chocolate malt, and roasted barley) separate from the other grains. Mash the 2-row pale malt, dextrine malt, and caramalt at 159°F (71°C) in 20 quarts (19 L) of water for 20 minutes, then mix in the darker grains. Hold for 5 minutes, then mash out, vorlauf, and sparge at 170°F (77°C). Boil for 60 minutes, adding the Columbus hops at the beginning of the boil. Pitch the yeast and ferment at 68°F (20°C) until the final gravity is reached, about 1 week. Allow the beer to condition for an additional week at 52°F (11°C) before packaging. Bottle or keg as usual.

EXTRACT WITH GRAINS OPTION:
Replace the 2-row pale malt with 9.9 pounds (4.5 kg) light liquid malt extract. Crush the caramalt, crystal malt, chocolate malt, and roasted barley and place them in a muslin brewing bag. Steep the crushed specialty grains in 2 gallons (7.8 L) water at 155°F (68°C) for 20 minutes. Rinse the grains with 3 quarts (2.8 L) hot water and allow it to drip into the kettle for about 15 minutes. To prevent extracting harsh tannins from the grain husks, be sure not to squeeze the bag. Add the malt extract to the brewpot with the heat turned off and stir well to avoid scorching or boil-overs. Top off the kettle to 6 gallons (23 L). Follow the remaining portion of the all-grain recipe.

Hill Farmstead Brewery’s Old World, Wild Mary Pilsner clone
Hill Farmstead Brewery’s Old World, Wild Mary Pilsner clone
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.048 FG = 1.010
IBU = 42 SRM = 3 ABV = 4.9%

According to Shaun Hill, Owner of Hill Farmstead Brewery, "This is an unreleased beer (at press time) that we internally refer to as Old World, Wild Mary. The base beer is our German-style Pilsner, Mary, aged in oak barrels that previously held our farmhouse ale, Arthur."

Ingredients
8.8 lbs. (4 kg) European Pilsner malt
0.3 lb. (130 g) malted wheat
0.5 lb. (220 g) acidulated malt
8 AAU Perle hops (60 min.) (1 oz./28g at 8% alpha acids)
4.4 AAU Hallertau Mittelfrüh (15 min.) (1.1 oz./32g at 4% alpha acids)
2.3 oz. (65 g) Hallertau Hersbrucker hops (0 min.)
SafLager 34/70 or Wyeast 2124 (Bohemian Lager)
The Yeast Bay TYB184 (Brettanomyces bruxellensis) or Omega Yeast OYL-201 (Brettanomyces bruxellensis)
5.3 oz. (150 g) dextrose (if bottling)
Safale US-05 or LalBrew CBC-1 (if bottling)

Step by step
Utilize a thin mash (~1.7 qts./lb. or 3.5 L/kg) to minimize the sparging volume. While this will produce weaker first wort, it will aid in less tannin extraction and help prevent contaminating the wort with potentially unsavory last runnings. Target a mash temperature of 148 °F (65 °C). Mash in with 4.1 gallons (15.5 L) of water. If using reverse osmosis water, add 1 tsp. of calcium chloride to achieve 50 ppm of calcium. Rest for 60 minutes. Measure mash pH at 20 minutes and adjust with food-grade acid (lactic, citric, phosphoric) as necessary to hit a target of 5.2 to 5.3.

When mashing is complete, recirculate (vorlauf) at least ten minutes until beer is very clear. (For the advanced homebrewer, adjusting and monitoring mash and boil pH will be paramount in producing the best beer).

After collecting first wort, sparge with 3.4 gallons (13 L) of water at 170 °F (77 °C) and collect 6.6 gallons (25 L) of wort into the boil kettle. Pay attention to the last runnings! Density (gravity) should never fall below 1.010 (2.5 ºP) and should taste pleasant. If last runnings become husky or tannic, cut the sparge and stop collecting wort. Water can be added directly to the kettle in order to reach desired volume.

Boil for 90 minutes, adding hops as indicated. At the end of the boil, cut the flame and let rest for 5 minutes. Whirlpool with the Hallertau Hersbrucker hops. After about 20 minutes of whirlpool, rapidly chill the wort to 45–50 °F (7–10 ºC). Transfer wort to the fermenter and pitch the lager yeast (at least two packets of dry yeast or, if liquid yeast, prepare a healthy starter and ensure activity and viability), oxygenate well. Ideal fermentation is at 45–50 °F (7–10 ºC). A prolonged 24–48 hour lag is common at this temperature.

When fermentation appears to have ceased after 2 to 3 weeks, transfer the beer to a secondary vessel (a neutral oak barrel would be preferred), and inoculate with Brettanomyces. Do not be concerned with a temperature rise or diacetyl rest.

The beer should condition at 50–54 °F (10–12 ºC) for several months in a neutral barrel (if possible). When ready for packaging, boil 5.3 oz. (150 g) of dextrose in 1 cup of water. Cool to room temperature, then very slowly sprinkle in 0.07 oz. (2 g) of a dry, neutral yeast. Add this sugar and yeast cocktail to your bottling bucket. This should produce 3 volumes of carbonation conditioned at room temperature. Open your first bottle in one month. Or, keg and carbonate to 3.0 v/v.

Indianapolis, Indiana

(5 gallons/19 L, extract with grains)
OG = 1.054FG = 1.009
IBU = 40SRM = 5ABV = 5.8%

Hippie Farm is a light and refreshing saison that marries the flavors of a simple, traditional farmhouse-style saison with hints of lemon and lavender. We start with a golden straw-colored barley base and add wheat to give it a little extra body, head retention, and wheat flavor. The beer is then lovingly hopped with Northern Brewer and Spalt hops to get a nice, soft hop bitterness and aroma. Late additions of both dried lemon peel and lavender flowers give this beer citrus and floral characteristics that meld perfectly with the base beer. As if this weren’t enough, a saison yeast produces spicy notes and fruity esters that make this beer truly unique. The yeast characteristics can be changed by choosing a different yeast strain and manipulating fermentation temperatures and pitching rates. The finished product is a farmhouse saison that is well-balanced and easy to drink, pint after pint. Not too high in alcohol, the elements of grain, hops, water, and yeast blend in harmony with the floral and citrus contributions of lemon and lavender. Drink a few of these and you will feel like you are right at home on the Hippie Farm.

Ingredients
6 lbs. (2.7 kg) light dried malt extract
1.5 lbs. (0.68 kg) white wheat malt
9 AAU Northern Brewer hops (60 min.) (1 oz./28 g at 9% alpha acids)
4.5 AAU Spalt hops (15 min.) (1 oz./28 g at 4.5% alpha acids)
1 tsp. Irish moss (20 min.)
0.5 oz. (14 g) lemon peel (15 min.)
0.04 oz. (1 g) lavender flowers (5 min.)
Wyeast 3711 (French Saison), Imperial Yeast B64 (Napoleon), Imperial Yeast B56 (Rustic), or Danstar Belle Saison yeast.
3⁄4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by step

Crush grains and then fill kettle with approximately 6.5 gallons (25 L) water for a volume of 5 gallons (19 L) post-boil. Heat to 160 °F (71 °C). Place crushed white wheat malt in a muslin bag and add to kettle. Allow to soak in 150–155 °F (66–68 °C) water for 30 minutes. Remove bag, and allow remaining water in grains to drain into kettle. Do not squeeze the grains. While stirring, add malt extracts until fully dissolved. Turn the heat on and bring wort to a boil. Add hops and Irish moss as directed.

At end of boil, chill wort as quickly as possible to 60–70 °F (16–21 °C).

Siphon or pour cooled wort into fermenter leaving as much sediment behind as possible. Top off to 5.25 gallons (20 L), aerate wort, pitch yeast, and attach airlock. If using a yeast starter, pitch entire contents of yeast starter into wort. Move fermenter to a dark place with a steady temperature of 66–74 °F (19–23 °C). When fermentation is complete, bottle or keg as usual.

Wyeast 3711 (French Saison), White Labs WLP590 (French Saison), Imperial Yeast B62 (Napoleon), or LalBrew Belle Saison yeast
7⁄8 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by step
Heat 13.9 qts. (13.1 L) of strike water to 162 °F (72 °C) and mix with grains. The mash should stabilize at about 149 °F (65 °C). Hold at this temperature for 60 minutes, then raise temperature to mash out at about 168 °F (76 °C), either by infusion of boiling water, decoction, or other means. Vorlauf until wort runs clear then begin the sparge process. Collect 7 gallons (26.5 L) and bring to a boil. Total boil time is 75 minutes, adding additions as indicated. After boil is complete, turn off the heat, add final hop addition, and give a long stir to create a whirlpool. Rest for 15 minutes.

Chill the wort to 75 °F (23 °C). There should be about 5.5 gallons (21 L) of wort in your fermenter. Add yeast and aerate wort if using liquid yeast. Place your fermenter in a warm place in the 80–90 °F (26–32 °C) range. Allow to ferment for four weeks, or until a stable gravity is reached. Bottle or keg after fermentation is complete, targeting a carbonation level of 2.8 v/v.

Step by step
Heat 2 gallons (7.6 L) of water to 157 °F (69°C) and add the rye malt and flaked oats in a steeping bag. The goal is to achieve a mash temperature of 149 °F (65 °C). Mash for 60 minutes. Rinse the grain bag with 170 °F (77 °C) water to top up to 6.5 gallons (24.6 L), remove bag, then boil. (If your brew kettle doesn’t allow for that large of a volume, rinse the grain bag with another gallon/4 L of water, remove bag, then raise to a boil.) When boil is achieved, take the kettle off the flame and slowly add the extract while stirring. Return to the heat source and boil for 60 minutes, adding hops as indicated. After boil is complete, turn off the heat, add final hop addition, and give a long stir to create a whirlpool. Rest for 15 minutes.

Chill the wort to 75 °F (23 °C). If you brewed a smaller volume, top off fermenter with pre-chilled water. In either case, the goal is to collect 5.5 gallons (21 L) of wort in your fermenter. Add yeast and aerate wort if using liquid yeast. Place your fermenter in a warm place in the 80–90 °F (26–32 °C) range. Allow to ferment for four weeks, or until a stable gravity is reached.

1.8 lbs. (0.82 kg) wheat bran
1.7 lbs. (0.77 kg) light molasses (10 min.)
3.6 AAU Cluster whole-leaf hops (first wort hop) (0.66 oz./19 g at 5.5% alpha acids)
10-qts. (10-L) fresh-picked alehoof
Fleischmann’s Active Dry or similar bread yeast
6.85 oz. (195 g) brown sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Boil roughly 1.25 gallons (5 L) of water and dough in the mash tun with the wheat bran. Rest 15–20 minutes then measure the temperature. Add roughly 1.25 gallons (5 L) of room temperature water a little at a time to bring the temperature to around 156 °F (69 °C). This extra water will allow you to break up the bran easier while mixing to thin out the mash and ensure that there are no dough balls.

Add 6-row malted barley to reach a target mash temperature of about 150 °F (66 °C), then rest for 60 minutes. Sparge with 172 °F (78 °C) water (mash tun will rise to 168 °F/76 °C), and lauter to 6.5 gallons (25 L) in the kettle. Before kettle heat is turned on, add the hops and half (~5 quarts/5 L) of the alehoof.

Total boil time is 90 minutes, adding molasses at 10 minutes until flameout. Stir well to mix the molasses into solution and then add remainder of alehoof. When the boil is complete, allow the wort in the kettle to naturally cool to about 98 °F (37 °C). Then transfer to the fermenter and pitch yeast.

Once fermentation is complete, transfer the beer over to a bottling bucket or keg for packaging.

Bottle or keg condition to 2.8 volumes of CO2 using brown sugar. You must accurately measure the volume of beer needing to be primed to hit your target. Dose the brown sugar at a rate of 1.37 oz. per gallon (10.26 g/L) and let rest at room or ambient temperature for about three days to condition.

Sensory Evaluation of Test Brew: This beer appears golden blond and slightly turbid. The head is tall and strong. On the palate, this beer has a faint sweetness and some graininess, balanced by a mild acidity. The noble hop aromas come to the fore especially in the finish. Cognoscenti will recognize this beer right after the first sip as a chewier and heftier forerunner of the modern Kölsch.

Hitachino Nest Sweet Stout clone
(5 gallon/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.049 FG = 1.019
IBU = 16 SRM = 41 ABV = 3.8%

Ingredients
6.0 lbs. (2.7 kg) 2-row pale malt
0.50 lbs. (0.23 kg) wheat malt
1.0 lbs. (0. 45 kg) crystal malt (55 °L )
1.25 lbs. (0.57 kg) roasted barley
1.0 lbs. (0. 45 kg) lactose (15 mins)
4.1 AAU Kent Goldings hops (60 mins)(0.75 oz./21 g of 5.5% alpha acids)
Wyeast 1099 (Whitbread Ale) yeast

Step by Step
Mash at 153 °F (67 °C) in 10 qts. (9.4 L) of water. Boil wort for 60 minutes. Add lactose for the final 15 minutes of the boil. Ferment at 68 °F (20 °C).

Countertop partial mash option:
Reduce amount of pale malt to 2.5 lbs. (1.1 kg) and add 2.75 lbs. (1.3 kg) Coopers Light liquid malt extract.

Begin by heating 5.5 qts. (5.2 L) of soft or distilled water to 164 °F (73 °C) in a large kitchen pot. Stir 1⁄2 tsp. calcium sulfate (gypsum) or calcium chloride into this water. In another pot, heat 2.0 qts (1.9 L) of soft water to around 164 °F (73 °C). Stir 1 tsp. calcium carbonate (chalk) or 1⁄2 tsp. sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) into this water. In your brewpot, begin heating a half-gallon (~2 L) of water to around 170 °F (77 °C). Place crushed pale, wheat and crystal malts in one grain bag and place in cooler. Put remaining roasted barley (crushed) in the other bag. Add the 5.5 qts. (5.2 L) of water to the grains in the cooler and stir it in. Let this mash, starting at 154 °F (68 °C), for 45 minutes. Likewise, steep the specialty grains in the pot of carbonate-rich water for 45 minutes (around 153 °F/67 °C), although this exact temperature is not critical. While grains mash and steep, heat about 8.0 qts. (7.6 L) of water to 180 °F (82 °C). When mashing and steeping is complete, scoop 1 qt. (~1 L) of 170 °F (77 °C) water from your brewpot (you can use a large measuring cup for this). Lift the specialty grains out of their steeping pot and place in a colander over your brewpot. Pour the "grain tea" through the grain bag (to strain out any large bits of grain) and then rinse the grains with the water pulled from your brewpot. Start heating this "grain tea" while you collect the wort from the cooler. To collect wort from mash, recirculate about 2.5 qts. (2.4 L) of wort, then add 180 °F (82 °C) water to cooler until it is full. Draw off wort and add to brewpot until the liquid level in the cooler is just above the grain bed. Add 180 °F (82 °C) water again. Repeat this process until you have collected 2.0 gallons/8 qts. (7.6 L) of wort. Bring wort to a boil. (Don't add extract now.) Add first dose of hops and boil for 60 minutes.

Add hops at times indicated in the ingredient list. Stir in liquid malt extract and lactose for the final 15 minutes of the boil. Cool wort, in sink or with wort chiller, to 68 °F (20 °C) and transfer to fermenter. Add water to top up to 5 gallons (19 L), aerate and pitch yeast. Ferment at 68 °F (20 °C).

Hobgoblin Turkey
Hobgoblin Turkey

Serves 10 to 12.

Ingredients

One 20 lb. fresh turkey
Kosher salt
1 tsp. freshly ground black pepper
1 large head of garlic, roasted with olive oil and salt and puréed with 1 tsp. salt
16 oz. Hobgoblin Ale or a malty, English substitute (Fullers ESB or Young’s Special London Ale)
10 oz. best-quality apricot jam (substitutions can be made, such as orange marmalade or blackberry jam)
3 lemons
1 fresh sage leaf (optional)
2 oz. unsalted butter
1 lemon sliced thin and 6 sage leaves for garnish
(Optional injecting mixture: 4 oz. unsalted melted butter, 2 oz. Hobgoblin and 2 oz. strained apricot jam).
Step by Step

Inject the turkey before cooking by plunging the needle into the
turkey and slowly pulling it out, injecting the mixture little by
little so that all layers of the turkey receive the jam mixture. Inject
the turkey’s breast, thighs and legs.

Heat the oven to 375°F. Rinse the turkey and pat dry. Salt the
turkey inside and out. Rub the garlic puree over the turkey, in the
cavity and under the skin. Tuck the sage leaves and one thinly sliced
lemon under the skin of the turkey.

Cut the remaining two lemons in half. Stuff them into the cavities
of the turkey. Transfer the turkey to a rack in the roasting pan. Heat
the butter, beer and jam until the jam is melted; do not boil. Cook the
turkey for 45 minutes. Then pour one half cup of the jam sauce over the
turkey. Keep basting with the jam sauce until it is finished.

Cover the turkey if it begins to brown too fast. If the juices in
the pan start to caramelize, add turkey or chicken stock to de-glaze.
The turkey is done when it registers 180°F in the thickest part of the
thigh (the cooking time should be approximately 12 minutes per pound).
Cover the roasted bird and let rest 20 minutes before carving. Garnish
with sage leaves and lemon slices before serving.

Hofbräuhaus Oktoberfestbier clone
(5 gallons/19 L, extract with grains)
OG = 1.062 FG = 1.014
IBU = 23 SRM = 8 ABV = 6.3%

The first Oktoberfest took place in 1810, to celebrate the wedding of the Bavarian prince Ludwig to Princess Therese. All of the people of Munich were invited to celebrate with them in the fields by the front gates of the city. The fields were nicknamed Theresienwiese, or "Theresa’s fields," in honor of the princess. The festival has been celebrated every year since then. Oktoberfest beers traditionally are brewed in the spring, lagered during the warm summer months and served in September during the annual festival.

Ingredients
1 lb. (0.45 kg) German Munich malt
4 oz. (113 g) Belgian caramel Munich malt
3.75 lbs. (1.7 kg) Muntons extra light dried malt extract
3.3 lbs. (1.5 kg) light liquid malt extract
2 oz. (57 g) maltodextrin powder
4 AAU Tettnanger hops (60 min.) (1 oz./28 g at 4% alpha acids)
3.2 AAU German Hallertau Hersbrucker hops (60 min.) (1 oz./28 g at 3.2% alpha acid)
1 tsp. Irish moss
Munich Lager (Wyeast 2308) or Oktoberfest Lager (White Labs WLP820) yeast
3/4 cup corn sugar (if bottling)

Step by Step
Bring one gallon (3.8 L) of water to 155 °F (68 °C), add crushed grain and hold for 30 minutes at 150 °F (66 °C). Strain the grain into the brewpot and wash grains with one gallon (3.8 L) of 168 °F (76 °C) water. Add the dried and liquid malt extract and bittering hops. Bring the total volume in the brewpot to 3 gallon (11.4 L).

Boil for 45 minutes, then add the Irish moss. Boil for 15 minutes, then remove the pot from the stove. Cool wort for 15 minutes in an ice bath or chill with wort chiller. Strain into fermenter and add water to obtain 5.25 gallons (20 L). Add yeast when wort has cooled to below 68 °F (20 °C). Oxygenate-aerate well.

Start fermentation at 60 to 62 °F (16 to 17 °C) until fermentation begins (approximately 24 hours). Bring primary fermenter to 47 to 52 °F (8 to 11 °C) for 7 days, then rack into secondary (glass carboy). Ferment at 47 to 52 °F (8 to 11 °C) for 4 weeks, then bring the fermenter to 60 to 62 °F (16 to 17 °C) until target gravity has been reached and the beer has cleared (approximately 2 additional weeks). Keg and force carbonate or prime and bottle. If bottling, carbonate the beer at 70 to 72 °F (21 to 22 °C) for 2 to 3 weeks. Store at cellar temperature.

Partial Mash: Acidify the mash water to below 7.2 pH. Mash 1.5 lbs. (0.68 kg) German two-row pilsner malt, 1.5 lbs. (0.68 kg) German Munich malt, 1.5 lbs. (0.68 kg) German Vienna and 4 oz. (113 g) Belgian caramel Munich malt in 1.5 gallons (5.6 L) water at 152 °F (67 °C) for 90 minutes. Sparge with 1.5 gallon (5.6 L) water at 5.7 pH and 168 °F (76 °C). Then follow the extract recipe, omitting 2 lbs. (0.91 kg) Muntons extra-light dry malt extract from the boil.

All-Grain: Acidify the mash water to below 7.2 pH. Mash 8.75 lbs. (4 kg) German two-row pilsner malt, 2.75 lbs. (1.25 kg) German Munich malt, 1.5 lbs. (0.68 kg) Vienna malt and 3 oz. (85 g) Belgian caramel Munich malt in 17 qts. (16 L) of water at 122 °F (50 °C) for 25 minutes then at 152 °F (67 °C) for 90 minutes. Sparge with 5 gallons (19 L) of water at 5.7 pH and 168 °F (76 °C). The total boil time is approximately 90 minutes. Add the Irish moss as indicated by the extract recipe.

This beer will peak between three and seven months after it is carbonated and will last at cellar temperatures for nine months.

IBU = 35 SRM = 10 ABV = 6.6%

Ingredients:
12 oz. (0.34 kg) British crystal malt (55° L)
1 oz. (28 g) British black malt
7 lbs. (3.2 kg) Muntons extra light dried malt extract (DME)
8 AAUs Fuggle hops (60 min.) (2 oz./57 g at 4% alpha acid)
5 AAUs East Kent Goldings (15 min.) (1 oz./28 g at 5% alpha acids)
2 AAUs Fuggle hops (2 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 4% alpha acids)
1 tsp. Irish moss (15 min.)
Wyeast 1275 (Thames Valley Ale) or White Labs WLP002 (English Ale) or Lallemand (London ESB Ale) yeast
1-1/4 cup Muntons extra light dry malt extract for priming

Step by Step:  

Bring 5 gallons (19 L) of water to 155 °F (69 °C), submerge the crushed grains in a grain bag and hold for 30 minutes. Remove the grains, allowing the grains to drip back into the pot. Add the dried malt extract and bittering hops. Bring the total volume in the brewpot to 6 gallons (23 L). Boil for 45 minutes, then add the second hop addition and Irish moss. Boil for 13 minutes, then add the final hop addition. Boil for 2 minutes, then remove the pot from stove. Cool wort for 15 minutes in an ice bath or chill with wort chiller. Strain into the primary fermenter and add water to obtain 5.25 gallons (20 L).

Add the yeast when the wort has cooled to below 80 °F (27 °C), then oxygenate-aerate well. Ferment at 68 °F (20 °C) for 7 days, then rack into secondary (glass carboy). Ferment until target gravity has been reached and beer has cleared (approximately 3 weeks). Prime and bottle or keg and force carbonate. If bottling, allow beer to carbonate at 70-72 °F (21-22 °C) for 2 to 3 weeks. Store at cellar temperature.

All-grain option:

Mash 12.5 lbs. (5.7 kg) British two-row pale ale malt and the specialty grains in 4.2 gallons (15.8 L) of water at 151 °F (66 °C) for 90 minutes. Sparge with 5 gallons (19 L) of water at 168 °F (76 °C). The total boil time is approximately 90 min. Cut the first hop addition of Fuggle to 5.9 AAU. Then add the second hops, Irish moss and final hops as indicated by the extract recipe.

Homebrew Chicha Beer

(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.048 FG = 1.010
IBU = 0 SRM = 2 ABV = 5.1%

This is a more traditional, rustic version using homemade and locally sourced ingredients.

Ingredients
5.5 lbs. (2.5 kg) Pilsner malt
5.5 lbs. (2.5 kg) malted corn
3–4 oz. (85–113 g) blend of dried lemon verbena, chamomile, mint, cinnamon (blended to taste)
Tepache starter (see step by step)
SafAle US-05 or a saison yeast
¾ cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by step
Two or three days before brewing, prepare the tepache starter. Wash a very ripe pineapple well. Cut off and chop up the peels. You can also add the pineapple core, chopped. Reserve the flesh of the pineapple for eating. Place the peels and the core, if using, in a pitcher or large jar. Add enough of a 1.030 solution of water and corn sugar to completely cover the pineapple. Cover container with cheesecloth and leave in a warm (77–86 °F/25–30 °C) place for 2–3 days, skimming white foam from the top every 12 hours. Strain and use as your starter after the wort has been prepared. Do not allow to ferment longer, or it will get too vinegary.

Using a brew-in-a-bag technique, mash the grains in 156 °F (69 °C) water for 90 minutes. Remove bag with grain, leaving behind 6.5 gallons (24.5 L) of wort.

Boil the wort for 60 minutes. Add the herbs at the end of the boil and allow to rest for 20 minutes before running off.

Transfer to fermenter, chilling to 68 °F (20 °C). Add the tepache starter allowing a free rise in temperature up to as high as 77 °F (25 °C). Ferment for three days. After this time, pitch Saccharomyces yeast of choice and allow fermentation to run to completion.

Rack the beer as gently as possible without disturbing carbonation, package in plastic soda bottles and serve within the next week, or keg and force carbonate.

Partial mash option:
Replace the malted corn with 5 lbs. (2.3 kg) pre-cooked white corn meal (such as P.A.N. brand) and reduce the Pilsner malt to 5 lbs. (2.3 kg).

Two or three days before brewing, prepare the tepache starter using instructions from the all-grain recipe.

Using a brew-in-a-bag technique, mash the grain and cornmeal in 156 °F (69 °C) water for 90 minutes. Remove bag with grain, leaving behind 6.5 gallons (24.5 L) of wort.

Boil the wort for 60 minutes. Add the herbs at the end of the boil and allow to rest for 20 minutes before running off.

Honey Cured Bacon (with Honey Kölsch)
Honey Cured Bacon (with Honey Kölsch)
Ingredients
1 each pork belly, skin on, trimmed 2 square and cut so you have equal halves (approximately 5 pounds/2.3 kg for each half)
10 oz. (283 g) Kosher salt
1.5 oz. (43 g) sodium nitrite (aka: "pink salt")
16 oz. (453 g) honey

Step by Step
1. Mix the Kosher salt and sodium nitrite with the honey to make a sticky paste.

2. Slather half the mixture on half of the pork belly and place the whole thing in Ziploc bag, removing as much air as possible.

3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 with other half of the pork belly. Label the skin sides of the bacon with date on the outside of the bag. Place the curing bellies on a plate and place them in a refrigerator.

4. Flip the bags every day to ensure proper overhauling (think even curing).

5. After five to six days remove the cured bellies and rinse them very well under cold running water.

6. Once the bellies are dry, smoke the bellies with indirect heat using your favorite moist wood, or even spent grains, until you get your desired color and flavor. I usually smoke my bellies with hickory at 130 °F (54 °C) for about one hour.

7. Once the smoking is complete, keep the bellies in the refrigerator until you are ready to slice and cook.

1.5 lbs. (0.68 kg) Great Western Superior flaked wheat
4 oz. (113 g) Weyermann acidulated malt
5.9 AAU Magnum pellet hops (60 min.) (0.5 oz/14 g at 11.8% alpha acids)
2 oz. (57 g) Hallertau Blanc pellet hops (hop stand)
2 oz. (57 g) Hull Melon pellet hops (hop stand)
2 oz. (57 g) Hallertau Blanc pellet hops (dry hop)
2 oz. (57 g) Hull Melon pellet hops (dry hop)
1/2 tsp. yeast nutrient (5 min.)
1/2 Whirlfloc tablet (5 min.)
The Yeast Bay Saison Blend
White Labs WLP644 (Saccharomyces "bruxellensis" Trois)
Brettanomyces bruxellensis var. CB2 (Jason Rodriguez’s Cantillon isolate)
Wyeast WY5223-PC (Lactobacillus brevis)
750 ml of German/French white wine (suggested: Trimbach Gewürztraminer)
1 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step

Single infusion mash at 148 °F (64 °C) for 75 minutes. Collect approximately 6.5 gallons (25 L) of wort in the kettle and bring to a boil. Boil 65 minutes adding hops, yeast nutrients and Whirlfloc according to the ingredient list. At the end of the boil, there should be approximately 5.5 gallons (21 L) in the kettle. Chill to 180 °F (80 °C) and add the hop stand addition, stir and let settle for 20 minutes. Chill to 65 °F, aerate the wort with filtered air or pure O2 and pitch with a starter of the yeast and bacteria. This recipe references my own personal mixed culture of yeast and bacteria, feel free to substitute in your own favorite mix of strains and cultures.

Ferment at 70 °F until the kräusen falls. Transfer to a keg or secondary vessel and add the dry hops and 1/2 cup of sugar. After several days, transfer to another keg or bottling bucket, add the bottle of wine and 1/2 cup of table sugar and allow to sit at cellar temperature for two months to carbonate and to allow yeast-wine interactions. Chill and serve when desired.

Can be bottled either after two weeks if the gravity is suitably low, or allow to ferment in a carboy until the gravity is stable before priming and bottling. Aim for 2.8 volumes of CO2 using a priming sugar calculator.

Extract option:
Replace the pale malt, flaked wheat and acidulated malt with 4 lbs. (1.8 kg) extra light dried malt extract, 1.7 lbs. (0.77 kg) wheat dried malt extract and 1/2 tsp. lactic acid (88%). Stir the extract and lactic acid into 6 gallons (23 L) of water and bring up to a boil. Refer to boil, and fermentation instructions in the all-grain version.

This is a relatively simple beer, one designed to showcase Mosaic® hops. By North American standards, it is modestly hopped. Enjoy an alternative to aggressively hopped beers.

Ingredients
7 lbs. (3.2 kg) Golden Promise malt
1.5 lbs. (0.34 kg) rye malt
1 lb. (0.45 kg) light Munich malt
8 oz. (233 g) white wheat
6 AAU Mosaic® hops (60 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 12% alpha acids)
4.8 AAU Mosaic® hops (10 min.) (0.4 oz./12 g at 12% alpha acids)

1 Whirlfloc tablet (10 min.)
Safale US-05, or White Labs WLP001 (California Ale) or Wyeast 1056 (American Ale)
1⁄2 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Mill the grains and dough-in, targeting a mash of around 1.25 quarts of water to 1 pound of grain (2.6 L/kg) and a temperature of 156 °F (69 °C). Hold the mash at 156 °F (68 °C) until enzymatic conversion is complete, about 60 minutes. Sparge slowly with 170 °F (77 °C) water, collecting wort until the pre-boil kettle volume is 6.5 gallons (24.6 L). Total boil time is 60 minutes. Add hops and Whirlfloc tablet as indicated.

Chill the wort to 65 °F (18 °C) and aerate wort thoroughly. There should be 5.5 gallons (21 L) in the fermenter. Pitch 1-quart (1-L) yeast starter if using liquid yeast or a package of dried yeast. Transfer to secondary when fermentation is complete, adding dry hops for 1 week or less to avoid grassy flavor.

Carbonate the beer to around 1.5–2 volumes of CO2 if kegging or bottling. If using casks, you may consider transferring two days after fermentation begins, being sure to take as little trub into the pin or firkin as possible.

Step by Step
Heat 4.5 quarts (4.3 L) of water up to 168 °F (76 °C). Place crushed grains in a muslin bag and submerge in the water. Stir to make sure there are no dough balls in the grain bag. Try to maintain mash temperature in the 148–158 °F (65–70 °C) range for 60 minutes. Remove the grains and place in a colander. Wash the grains with 1 gallon (4 L) hot water. Dissolve malt extract into wort; and top off to 6.5 gallons (24.6 L).

Total boil time is 60 minutes, adding bittering hops at 60 minutes into the boil and again 10 minutes before flame out. Add Whirlfloc with 10 minutes left in the boil.

Chill the wort to 65 °F (18 °C) and aerate wort thoroughly. There should be 5.5 gallons (21 L) in the fermenter. Pitch 1-quart (1-L) yeast starter if using liquid yeast or a package of dried yeast. Transfer to secondary when fermentation is complete, adding dry hops for 1 week or less to avoid grassy flavor.

Carbonate the beer to around 1.5–2 volumes of CO2 if kegging or bottling. If using casks, you may consider transferring two days after fermentation begins, being sure to take as little trub into the pin or firkin as possible.

Tips for Success:
Because Manx water is so soft, the brewer Rob Storey Burtonizes the water for this beer (his schedule is Na+ 400, Cl- 200, HCO- 325-50, Ca+ 170 g/bbl). Yours will be different unless starting with reverse osmosis or very soft water.

For his lower hopped beers, Rob first chills to 64–65 °F (17–18 °C) to assist in cold break, then runs off into the fermenter at (65–66 °F (18–19 °C) before pitching. Several yeasts are used; a majority of Hooded Ram’s beers are fermented with Safale’s US-05 yeast, others with Lallemand’s Nottingham.

The "double stout" in this beer’s name is not indicative of a strong beer. Actually, it’s quite low in gravity and makes a particularly good session pint. What the double means to me is that this beer literally has double the flavor of other low gravity stouts. East Kent Goldings hops lend a spicy character to the nose which blends in perfectly well with its rich, thick toasty body. The deep roast edges finish into a crisp dryness that ensures this beer’s utter drinkability. You better get this beer fast because it’s only seasonally available.

Ingredients
3.0 lb. (1.4 kg) mild malt
3.0 lb. (1.4 kg) English pale malt
2.0 lb. (0.91 kg) brown malt
1.0 lb. (0.45 kg) No. 1 invert sugar
13 oz. (0.37 kg) black malt
5.6 AAU Challenger hops (75 min.) (0.75 oz./21 g of 7.5% alpha hops)
0.25 oz. (7.1 g) Fuggle hops (15 min.)
0.25 oz. (7.1 g) East Kent Goldings hops (15 min.
0.25 oz. (7.1 g) East Kent Goldings hops (dry hopped)
Wyeast 1318 (London III) yeast (1 qt./1 L yeast starter)
3/4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step

This is an extremely well balanced, easy-to-drink saison brewed with rye. The hops are not the star here, it’s all about the rye and the brewer’s skill.

Ingredients
8 lbs. (3.6 kg) Belgian Pilsner malt
2.25 lbs. (1 kg) flaked rye
7 oz. (200 g) Weyermann Caramunich® III malt (56 °L)
6 oz. (170 g) rice hulls
5.4 AAU German Magnum hops (60 min.) (0.4 oz./11 g at 13.5% alpha acids)
5 AAU German Tettnang hops (10 min.) (1 oz./28 g at 5% alpha acids)
Wyeast 3711 (French Saison) or Lallemand Belle Saison yeast
¾ cup (150 g) dextrose (if priming)

Step by Step
This is a single infusion mash. Mash the grains and rice hulls at 151 °F (66 °C) to develop a balanced mouthfeel and light body. Collect 6.5 gallons (25 L) of wort in the kettle and boil the wort for 90 minutes, adding the first hop addition 30 minutes after the beginning of the boil. With 10 minutes remaining in the boil, add the final hop addition. Chill the wort to 73 °F (23 °C) and aerate well. Pitch the yeast and fermentation should commence within 24–48 hours. Let the fermentation temperature rise up to about 79 °F (26 °C) over the course of the week and hold at a warmer temperature until fermentation is complete. After primary fermentation, let the beer condition one to two weeks before you bottle or keg. Carbonate to 2.5–3 volumes of CO2.

Partial mash option:
Reduce the Pilsner malt to 3 lbs. (1.36 kg), add 3.3 lbs. (1.5 kg) Pilsen liquid malt extract, and eliminate the rice hulls from the all-grain recipe.

Steep the crushed grains in 9 qts. (8.5 L) of water at 151 °F (66 °C) for 30–40 minutes. Wash the grains with 1 gallon (4 L) of hot water. Add the malt extract to the wort and top off with water to achieve a boil volume of 5.5 gallons (21 L). Boil for 60 minutes. Follow the remaining portion of the all-grain recipe.

Vinnie Cilurzo of Russian River Brewing Company in Santa Rosa, California brews what is arguably the world's best example of this style, Pliny the Elder. Despite the huge hop levels and higher alcohol strength, it is superbly drinkable. Vinnie very generously shared his recipe with the brewing community and just about everyone interested in this style has seen his recipe. The recipe below, while a little bigger in starting gravity than Vinnie's, is a descendant of his original.

Ingredients
13.5 lbs. (6.12 kg) American 2-row malt (2 °L)
0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) wheat malt (2 °L)
0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) crystal malt (40 °L)
1.25 lb. (0.56 kg) corn sugar (0 °L) (15 min.)
26.3 AAU Warrior® hop pellets (90 min.) (1.75 oz./50 g at 15% alpha acids)
22.8 AAU Chinook hop pellets (90 min.) (1.75 oz./50 g at 13% alpha acids)
12 AAU Simcoe® hop pellets (45 min.) (1 oz./28 g at 12% alpha acids)
14 AAU Columbus hop pellets (30 min.) (1 oz./28 g at 14% alpha acids)
15.75 AAU Centennial hop pellets (0 min.) (1.75 oz./50 g at 9% alpha acids)
12 AAU Simcoe® hop pellets (0 min.) (1 oz./28 g at 12% alpha acids)
2.5 oz. (71 g) Columbus hop pellets (dry hop)
1.5 oz. (43 g) Centennial hop pellets (dry hop)
1.5 oz. (43 g) Simcoe® hop pellets (dry hop)
White Labs WLP001 (California Ale), Wyeast 1056 (American Ale), or Safale US-05 yeast
3⁄4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Mill the grains and dough-in targeting a mash around 1.5 quarts of water to 1 pound of grain (a liquor-to-grist ratio of about 3:1 by weight) and a temperature of 150 °F (66 °C). Hold the mash at 150 °F (66 °C) until enzymatic conversion is complete. Infuse the mash with near-boiling water while stirring or with a recirculating mash system raise the temperature to mash out at 168 °F (76 °C). Sparge slowly with 170 °F (77 °C) water, collecting wort until the pre-boil kettle volume is around 6.5 gallons (24.6 L) and the gravity is 1.061.

The total wort boil time is 90 minutes. Addthe bittering hops right at the beginning. Add the other hop additions according to the schedule and the corn sugar as well as Irish moss or other kettle finings with
15 minutes left in the boil. Chill the wort rapidly to 67 °F (19 °C), let the break material settle, rack to the fermenter, pitch the yeast and aerate thoroughly. Use 15 grams of properly rehydrated dry yeast, 3 liquid yeast packages, or make an appropriate starter. Ferment at 67 °F (19 °C), slowly raising the temperature to 70 °F (21 °C) as the fermentation begins to slow. With healthy yeast, fermentation should be complete in a week, but don’t rush it.

As soon as the bulk of the yeast begins to drop, transfer the beer to a second fermenter and add the dry hops. The pellets should break up and eventually settle to the bottom of the fermenter. This might take a few days, so don’t panic. Let the beer sit on the hops for another seven days, approximately seven to ten days total.
Rack to a keg and force carbonate or rack to a bottling bucket, add priming sugar, and bottle. Target a carbonation level of 2 to 2.5 volumes.

White Labs WLP001 (California Ale) or Wyeast 1056 (American Ale) or Safale US-05 yeast
3⁄4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by step
Mill the grains and dough-in targeting a mash of around 1.5 quarts of water to 1 pound of grain (a liquor-to-grist ratio of about 3:1 by weight) and a temperature of 149 °F (65 °C). Hold the mash at 149 °F (65 °C) until enzymatic conversion is complete. Infuse the mash with near-boiling water while stirring or with a recirculating mash system raise the temperature to mash out at 168 °F (76 °C). Sparge slowly with 170 °F (77 °C) water, collecting wort until the pre-boil kettle volume is around 5.9 gallons (22.3 L) and the gravity is 1.055.

Once the wort is boiling, add the bittering hops. The total wort boil time is 1 hour after adding the bittering hops. During that time add the Irish moss or other kettle finings with 15 minutes left in the boil and add the last three hop additions at 10 minutes remaining, 5 minutes remaining and at flame out. Chill the wort to 67 °F (19 °C) and aerate thoroughly. The proper pitch rate is 11 grams of properly rehydrated dry yeast, two packages of liquid yeast, or one package of liquid yeast in a 2.5-liter starter. Ferment around 67 °F (19 °C) until the yeast drops clear. With healthy yeast, fermentation should be complete in a week or less. Allow the lees to settle and the brew to mature without pressure for another two days after fermentation appears finished. Rack to a keg and force carbonate or rack to a bottling bucket, add priming sugar and bottle.

Step by Step
If you can’t get fresh liquid malt extract, use an appropriate amount of dried malt extract instead.

Mill or coarsely crack the specialty malt and place loosely in a grain bag. Avoid packing the grains too tightly in the bag, using more bags if needed. Steep the bag in about 1 gallon (~4 liters) of water at roughly
170 °F (77 °C) for about 30 minutes. Lift the grain bag out of the steeping liquid and rinse with warm water. Allow the bags to drip into the kettle for a few minutes while you add the malt extract. Do not squeeze the bags. Add enough water to the steeping liquor and malt extract to make a pre-boil volume of 5.9 gallons (22.3 L) and a gravity of 1.055 (13.6 °P). Stir thoroughly to help dissolve the extract and bring to a boil.
Once the wort is boiling, add the bittering hops. The total wort boil time is 1 hour after adding the bittering hops. During that time add the Irish moss or other kettle finings with 15 minutes left in the boil and add the last three hop additions at 10 minutes remaining, 5 minutes remaining and at flame out. Chill the wort to 67 °F (19 °C) and aerate thoroughly.

Step by Step
Mill the grains. Dough in using 4.5 gallons (17 L) of water with a target mash temperature of 150 °F (65 °C). Hold the mash temperature for approximately 60 minutes or until the conversion is complete. Raise the temperature of the mash to 168 °F (76 °C) and begin sparging with 170 °F (77 °C) water until you collect 6 (23 L) gallons of wort in the kettle. The total wort boiling time for this recipe is 60 minutes. Make additions according to the ingredient list.

Cool the wort to 70 °F (21 °C), transfer to your fermenter and aerate the wort adequately before pitching your yeast. Ferment around 70 °F (21 °C) until the final gravity is reached, which should be in five to seven days. Rack to a secondary vessel and allow the beer to mature another five to seven days around the same temperature. Your beer is now ready to rack into a keg or bottles along with the priming sugar.

(If you cannot perform a full-wort boil, boil at least 4 gallons/15 L of wort and reserve about half of the malt extract for the final 15 minutes of the boil.) Stir in the malt extracts and begin the boil. The total wort boiling time for this recipe is 60 minutes. Make additions according to the ingredient list.

Cool the wort to 70 °F (21 °C), transfer to your fermenter and aerate the wort adequately before pitching your yeast. Ferment around 70 °F (21 °C) until the final gravity is reached, which should be in five to seven days. Rack to a secondary vessel and allow the beer to mature another five to seven days around the same temperature. Your beer is now ready to rack into a keg or bottles along with the priming sugar.

Hops Smoked Chicken
Hops Smoked Chicken

Ingredients:

1 whole chicken
Mesquite wood smoking chips
1 oz. Cascade hop pellets water
1 tbsp. cumin
1 tbsp. chili powder
1 tsp. dry mustard
1 tbsp. chopped dry rosemary
salt and pepper to taste
Step-by-step:

Cut chicken into halves. Split the chicken at the back bone and breast.
Rub meat, both sides, with the mixture of herbs and spices.
Prepare charcoal, light and let coals turn grey before placing smoking pan into grill.
Place 2 handfuls of mesquite into smoking pan along with hops. Add
enough water to wet the bottom of the wood chips, but not covering wood.
If smoking pan has holes or you do not have a smoking pan, one can
easily be made from tin foil. Tear 2 sheets about 10 inches wide. Turn
up sides 2 inches and crease the corners, allowing liquid to be kept
inside. After adding wood, hops, and water, place a sheet on top, fully
covering lower half. Poke a few holes in the top, allowing smoke to
leave pouch.
Place smoking pan on side of coals, allowing
it to heat to the point of smoking. This may take up to 10 minutes. The
hop pellets will expand with the steam from the water.
Place the chicken, skin side down, on the grill. Sear skin side before
turning. Allow chicken to cook for about 45 minutes or until thickest
part is 160 ºF (71 ºC) or higher.

OG = 1.064  FG = 1.014
IBU = 70  SRM = 29  ABV = 6.8%

Originally brewed in the summer of 2009 for the North American Organic Brewers Festival, this dark IPA won a silver medal at the Australian International Beer Awards in 2011.

Ingredients
11.5 lbs. (5.2 kg) Pilsner malt
12 oz. (0.34 kg) crystal malt (60 °L)
8 oz. (0.23 kg) black barley malt (530 °L)
4 oz. (113 g) chocolate malt (350 °L)
8.4 AAU Magnum hops (60 min.) (0.6 oz./17 g at 14% alpha acids)
6.5 AAU Mt. Hood hops (30 min.) (1 oz./28 g at 6.5% alpha acids)
3 AAU Amarillo® hops (30 min.) (0.3 oz./8.5 g at 10% alpha acids)
3.8 AAU Simcoe® hops (30 min.) (0.3 oz./8.5 g at 12.8% alpha acids)
0.75 oz. (21 g) Cascade hops (0 min.)
0.4 oz. (11 g) Amarillo® hop (0 min.)
0.4 oz. (11 g) Simcoe® hop (0 min.)
0.5 oz. (14 g) Amarillo® hops (dry hop)
0.5 oz. (14 g) Cascade hops (dry hop)
0.3 oz. (8.5 g) Simcoe® hops (dry hop)
1⁄2 tsp. yeast nutrient (15 min.)
1⁄2 tsp. Irish moss (30 min.)
White Labs WLP013 (London Ale) or

Wyeast 1318 (London Ale III) yeast
3⁄4 cup (150 g) dextrose (if priming)

Step by Step
This is a single step infusion mash. Mix the crushed grains with 17 quarts (16 L) of 163 °F (73 °C) water to stabilize at 152 °F (67 °C) for 60 minutes. Sparge slowly with 170 °F (77 °C) water. Collect approximately 6.5 gallons (23 L) of wort runoff to boil for a total of 90 minutes, adding hops and other ingredients as per the ingredient schedule. Cool the wort to 68 °F (20 °C). Pitch your yeast and aerate the wort heavily. Hold at that temperature until fermentation is complete. Transfer to a carboy, avoiding any splashing to prevent aerating the beer and add the dry hops. Allow the beer to condition for one week and then bottle or keg.

Extract with grains option:
Substitute the Pilsner malt in the all-grain recipe with 6.6 lbs. (3 kg) Pilsen liquid malt extract. Steep the crushed grain in 2 gallons (7.6 L) of water at 152 °F (67 °C) for 30 minutes. Remove grains from the wort and rinse with 2 quarts (1.8 L) of hot water. Add the dried malt extract and boil for 60 minutes. While boiling, add the hops, Irish moss and yeast nutrient as per the schedule. With 15 minutes remaining in the boil add the liquid malt extract and stir until completely dissolved to avoid scorching the extract. After the boil is complete, add the wort to 2 gallons (7.6 L) of cold water in the sanitized fermenter and top off with cold water up to 5 gallons (19 L). Follow the remaining portion of the all-grain recipe.

* The base recipe, and specifications listed above, are for my favorite Maibock recipe before freeze-distillation. Note that once freeze-distilled, these values will change, however to what effect is determined by how much ice you decide to leave behind.

Ingredients
12 lbs. (5.4 kg) German Pilsner malt
0.46 lb. (0.21 kg) melanoidin malt
0.4 lb. (0.18 kg) Carapils® malt
0.4 lb. (0.18 kg) Weyermann Caramunich® I malt
0.4 lb. (0.18 kg) Weyermann Carahell® (10 °L)
0.4 lb. (0.18 kg) Weyermann Carared® (20 °L)
0.23 lb. (0.10 kg) Weyermann Caraaroma® (150 °L)
3.6 AAU Tettnanger hops (85 min.) (0.9 oz./26 g at 4% alpha acids)
3.8 AAU Hallertauer Mittelfrüh hops (5 min.) (0.9 oz./26 g at 4.25% alpha acids)
1.4 oz. (40 g) Hallertauer Mittelfrüh hops (0 min.)
Wyeast 2124 (Bohemian Lager) or Wyeast 2206 (Bavarian Lager) or White Labs WLP830 (German Lager) or White Labs WLP833 (German Bock) or SafLager S-23 or Mangrove Jack’s M76 yeast
Lallemand CBC-1 yeast and 2⁄3 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Mash-in at 126 °F (52 °C); rest 15 minutes; raise temperature to 144 °F (62 °C); rest 25 minutes; raise temperature to 162 °F (72 °C); rest 20 minutes; raise temperature for mash-out to 172 °F (78 °C). Lauter as normal.

Boil 90 minutes, adding hops as indicated. At the end of the boil add the aroma hops and whirlpool for 15 minutes. Cool to 55 °F (13 °C). After the beer reaches terminal gravity (should be approximately 1.014 after 7 to 10 days), reduce temperature by 4 °F (2 °C) per day to about 32 °F (0 °C). Package about four weeks after brew day.

Up to this point you have brewed a Maibock. To turn it into an eisbock, purge your fermentation bucket (ideally one with a spigot at the bottom) with CO2 to minimize oxygen pickup and then freeze the beer.

When enough of the beer has frozen to your liking (likely 2–3 days — the longer you freeze it the more concentrated the eisbock will be), drain the higher-concentrated beer into a receiving vessel (such as a Cornelius keg) that has been purged with CO2. Add CO2 to the top of the discharging bucket(s), too, as the headspace increases during draining. This also reduces the chance of oxidation. For the same reason, the transfer tube should be long enough to reach the bottom of the receiving vessel. Let the beer settle for a couple of days and then rack it again to help clarify (or filter the beer).

Rack to a keg and force carbonate, or add fresh CBC-1 yeast and priming sugar before bottling.

This extract recipe assumes you can find Weyermann Bavarian Maibock malt extract. If this extract is unavailable in your region of the world, you can steep all the specialty grains in the all-grain recipe and swap out the Pilsner malt with 8 lbs. (3.6 kg) Pilsen liquid malt extract.

Ingredients
8.8 lbs. (4 kg) Weyermann Bavarian Maibock malt extract
3.6 AAU Tettnanger hops (85 min.) (0.9 oz./26 g at 4% alpha acids)

Lallemand CBC-1 yeast and 2⁄3 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Start heating 5 gallons (19 L) of water. As the water warms, remove from heat and stir in all the extract until fully dissolved. Return to heat and bring to a boil.

Boil 60 minutes, adding hops as indicated. At the end of the boil add the aroma hops and whirlpool for 15 minutes. Cool to 55 °F (13 °C). After the beer reaches terminal gravity (should be approximately 1.014 after 7 to 10 days), reduce temperature by 4 °F (2 °C) per day to about 32 °F (0 °C). Package about four weeks after brew day.

Icarus Brewing Co.’s Pineapple Hindenburg clone
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.064 FG = 1.016
IBU = 17.1 SRM = 6 ABV = 6.2%

This recipe was born out of a collaboration with the Ocean County Homebrewers club. The base recipe makes a very nice New England-style pale ale, but Icarus takes that and throws fresh habaneros into the kettle and conditions it on fresh pineapple that complements the BRU-1TM hops.

Ingredients
4.75 lbs. (2.2 kg) Golden Promise pale ale malt
2.75 lbs. (1.25 kg) spelt malt (wheat malt if unavailable)
2 lbs. (0.9 kg) Vienna malt
1.75 lbs. (0.8 kg) flaked oats
1 lb. (0.45 kg) wheat malt
1 lb. (0.45 kg) dextrin malt
0.16 lb. (73 g) acidulated malt
3.6 AAU CTZ hops (60 min.) (0.2 oz./5.7 g at 18% alpha acids)
3.9 AAU BRU-1™ hops (0 min.) (0.3 oz./8.5 g at 13% alpha acids)
3 oz. (84 g) BRU-1™ hops (dry hop)
3 oz. (84 g) Citra® Cryo hops (dry hop)
0.75 oz. (21 g) chopped fresh habanero peppers (0 min.)
1 qt. (0.9 L) pineapple, pureed
White Labs WLP066 (London Fog), or Wyeast 1318 (London Ale III), or Imperial Yeast A38 (Juice), or LalBrew Verdant IPA yeast
2⁄3 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
This is a single infusion mash with a soft water profile that favors chlorides over sulfates with a dash of Epsom salt (150 ppm chloride, 40 ppm sulfate,
15 ppm magnesium). Strike in utilizing 1.3 qts. of water per pound of grain (2.7 L/kg) to achieve a stable mash temperature around 152 °F (67 °C). Hold for 60 minutes or until conversion is complete. Begin the lauter process by either raising to mash out temperature or recirculating. Sparge with enough 168 °F (76 °C) water to collect 6.5 gallons (24.6 L) of wort. Add the CTZ hops at the beginning of the boil and then boil 60 minutes.

Turn off heat and add flameout hops and habanero peppers, then begin a whirlpool. Allow wort to settle for 15 minutes before chilling to 66 °F (19 °C). Aerate the wort with filtered air (you don’t want to over oxygenate). Pitch yeast and ferment at 68 °F (20 °C). Add the dry hops one day after signs of fermentation. After five days, transfer onto pineapple in a well-purged keg or secondary vessel for several days. If serving on draft you may want to transfer to another purged keg. Carbonate the beer to 2.3 volumes CO2.

Step by Step
Two or three days before brewing, make a yeast starter. (OG 1.015 to 1.020, aerated thoroughly before pitching the yeast. Ferment yeast starter in the mid 70s °F/~24 °C.)

On brew day, mash in at 149 °F (65 °C) in 20 qts. (19 L) of water and hold for 25 minutes. Vorlauf for 20 minutes, then begin collecting your wort. Sparge with water hot enough to make the grain bed temperature rise to 170 °F (77 °C) by the end of wort collection. (Or, mash out to 170 °F/77 °C and sparge with water hot enough to keep the grain bed at that temperature.) Collect at least 8.0 gallons (30 L) of wort (or monitor runnings and stop collecting wort when the specific gravity drops below 1.010). Boil wort for 2 hours (or until volume is reduced to 5 gallons/19 L). Add hops at times indicated in the ingredient list. After the boil, stir wort and wait 15 minutes before beginning to chill wort. (Alternately, add the 0 minute hop additions with 15 minutes left in the boil and skip the whirlpool.) Primary fermentation may take about 3 weeks at 70 °F (21 °C). Dry hop after fermentation is complete.

Ice Cider
Ice Cider
(2 gallons/8 L)
OG = 1.144 FG = 1.061
ABV = 10.9%

Ingredients
10 gallons (38 L) fresh-pressed, unpasteurized apple cider
7.5 grams Go-Ferm
6 grams Fermaid O
6 grams Lalvin 71B yeast
Sulfite

Step by Step
Pour the juice into a sanitized bucket or carboy and freeze until the juice is completely frozen solid. Once frozen, move the juice to a warmer location that will result in a slow thaw. Sanitize a collection container and collect the concentrated juice, checking the gravity with a refractometer once close to 20% of the juice has thawed and been collected. When the gravity of the collected juice reaches about 1.144, stop collecting the juice (should be about 2 gallons/7.6 L in my experience). You can continue thawing juice and checking the gravity to see if you can collect enough to make a small batch of a more sessionable ice cider as well.

Making sure to give the juice a good mixing, measure the pH and sulfite to 50 ppm accordingly. Oxygenate and add Fermaid O, shooting for a slightly lower amount than would be added to a similar gravity mead.

Warm the must to fermentation temperature and temper the rehydrated yeast with small amounts of the must before pitching. Ferment cool at the low end of the yeast temperature range. A good rate of fermentation would be a drop of two gravity points a day. Start checking your gravity daily once you are about 10 points higher than your desired finishing gravity.

Crash cooling to 25 °F (-4 °C) and adding sulfite should stop your fermentation. The cider should drop clear in 2–3 weeks, but if not you may need to rack 2–3 times or add a clarifying agent of your choice.

Once brilliantly clear, sulfite one more time to 50 ppm, bottle, and let age for a couple of months to help the flavor and acidity mature and mellow.

(5 gallons/ 19 L extract with grains)
OG = 1.052 FG = 1.010
IBUs = 26 SRM = 15 ABV = 5.5%

Ingredients
3.3 lbs. (1.5 kg) Muntons light liquid malt extract
2 lbs. (0.9 kg) light dried malt extract
22 oz. (0.62 kg) crystal malt (80 ºL)
6 oz. (170 g) carastan malt (35 ºL)
6 oz. (170 g) Carapils® malt
6.6 AAU Cascade hops (60 min.) (1.2 oz./34 g of 5.5% alpha acid)
1.25 AAU Willamette pellet hops (3 min.) (0.25 oz./7 g of 5% alpha acid)
2.4 AAU Tetnanger pellet hops (3 min.) (0.25 oz./7 g of 4.8% alpha acid)
1⁄2 tsp. Irish moss (15 min.)
White Labs WLP 001 (California Ale) or Wyeast 1056 (American Ale) or Safale US-05 yeast
0.75 cup (150 g) corn sugar (for priming)

Step by Step
Steep the crushed grain in 2 gallons (7.6 L) of water at 152 ºF (67 ºC) for 30 minutes. Remove grains from the wort and rinse with 2 quarts (1.9 L) of hot water. Add the liquid and dry malt extracts and bring to a boil. While boiling, add the hops and Irish moss as per the schedule. During the boil, use this time to thoroughly sanitize a fermenter. Now add the wort to 2 gallons (7.6 L) of cold water in the sanitized fermenter and top off with cold water up to 5 gallons (19 L). Cool the wort to 75 ºF (24 ºC). Pitch your yeast and aerate the wort heavily. Allow the beer to cool to 68 ºF (20 ºC). Hold at that temperature until fermentation is complete. Transfer to a carboy, avoiding any splashing to prevent aerating the beer. Let the beer condition for one week and then bottle or keg. Allow to carbonate and age for two weeks and enjoy your Runaway Red Ale.

All-grain option: This is a single step infusion mash. Replace the malt syrup and dried extract with 9 lbs. (4.1 kg) 2-row pale malt. Mix the crushed grain with 3.5 gallons (13 L) of 170 °F (77 °C) water to stabilize at 152 ºF (67 °C) for 60 minutes. Sparge slowly with 175 ºF (79 ºC) water. Collect approximately 6 gallons (23 L) of wort runoff to boil for 60 minutes. Reduce the 60 minute hop addition to 1 oz. (28 g) to allow for the higher utilization factor of a full wort boil. The remainder of this recipe and procedures are the same as the extract with grain recipe.

(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.057 FG = 1.011
IBU = 16 SRM = 5 ABV = 6%

Ingredients
9.8 lbs. (4.5 kg) Maris Otter pale ale malt
1 lb. (450 g) rolled oats
1 lb. (450 g) pale wheat malt
4.5 AAU Boadicea hops (60 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 8.9% alpha acids)
1.1 oz. (31 g) Jester® hops (hopstand)
1.1 oz. (31 g) Olicana® hops (hopstand)
1.1 oz. (31 g) Harlequin® hops (hopstand)
0.9 oz. (26 g) Jester® hops (dry hop, day 3)
0.9 oz. (26 g) Olicana® hops (dry hop, day 3)
0.9 oz. (26 g) Harlequin® hops (dry hop, day 3)
1.2 oz. (35 g) Jester® hops (dry hop, day 7)
1.2 oz. (35 g) Olicana® hops (dry hop, day 7)
1.2 oz. (35 g) Harlequin® hops (dry hop, day 7)
LalBrew Verdant IPA, Wyeast 1318 (London Ale III), or Imperial Yeast A38 (Juice) yeast
3⁄4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Mash all the grains at 152 °F (67 °C) for one hour. Collect around 6.5 gallons (25 L) of wort in the kettle and boil for one hour, adding the Boadicea hops as soon as it begins to boil. At the end of the boil, cool the wort to 158–176 °F (70–80 °C) and add the hopstand hops. Hold the wort within this temperature range for 20 minutes, then cool to 68 °F (20 °C) and pitch the yeast.

Ferment at 68 °F (20 °C). After three days add the first dry hops. Add the second round of dry hops after 7 days and then begin cooling to 39 °F (4 °C). Hold at this temperature for two days before packaging, ideally by closed transfer to a keg to avoid oxidation. Force carbonate to 2.5 volumes or prime and bottle condition.

OG = 1.080  FG = 1.020
IBU = 30  SRM = 34  ABV = 8.4%

This Belgian dark strong ale is brewed with dark candi syrup and dark malts to create a beautiful dark amber ale with sweet, toffee-like aromas.

Ingredients
11 lbs. (5 kg) Pilsner malt
2.25 lbs. (1 kg) aromatic malt
1 lb. (0.45 kg) Carabrown® malt (55 °L)
1 lb. (0.45 kg) Briess Extra Special malt (130 °L)
1.25 lbs. (0.57 kg) Belgian dark candi syrup (180 °L)
10 AAU Sorachi Ace hops (60 min.) (1 oz./28 g at 10% alpha acids)
White Labs WLP500 (Trappist Ale) or Wyeast 1214 (Belgian Abbey) yeast
3⁄4 cup (150 g) dextrose (if priming)

Step by Step
Mill the grains and mix with 4.6 gallons (17.3 L) of 162 °F (72 °C) strike water to reach a mash temperature of 150 °F (65.5 °C). Hold this temperature for 90 minutes. Vorlauf until your runnings are clear, and lauter. Sparge the grains with 2.7 gallons (10.2 L) water at 170 °F (77 °C), stir in Belgian candi syrup until dissolved, and top up as necessary to obtain 6 gallons (23 L) of wort. Boil for 60 minutes, adding hops according to the ingredient list. After the boil, chill the wort to slightly below fermentation temperature, about 65 °F (18 °C). Aerate the wort with pure oxygen or filtered air and pitch yeast. Ferment at 66 °F (19 °C) for two days. After initial fermentation begins, allow wort to free rise to 76 °F (24 °C) until fermentation is complete (a specific gravity of about 1.020). Once the beer completes fermentation, bottle or keg the beer and carbonate to approximately 2.5 volumes. You may want to cold-crash the beer prior to packaging to 35 °F (2 °C) for 48 hours to improve clarity. Store carbonated beer at near-freezing temperatures for at least two weeks before drinking.

Partial mash option:
Substitute the Pilsner malt in the all-grain recipe with 7.5 lbs. (3.4 kg) Pilsner liquid malt extract. Bring 5.4 qts. (5 L) of water to approximately 162 °F (72 °C) and mix in the crushed grains placed in grain bags for 60 minutes. Remove the grain bags and wash with 1 gallon (4 L) hot water. Let the grain bags drain fully. Add liquid extract and Belgian dark candi syrup while stirring, and top off to 6 gallons (23 L) wort. Stir until everything is completely dissolved. Bring the wort to a boil. Boil for 60 minutes. Follow the remaining portion of the all-grain recipe.

Tips for Success:
Brewer Chip Lewis notes that the initial temperature restraint during fermentation helps with the development of more spicy/peppery phenols relative to the levels of banana and clove. This spicy, peppery note complements the dark raisin, burnt sugar, and pit fruit flavors in the beer beautifully! As Chip also says, this beer is "pretty straightforward" – like so many other Belgian beers, the complexity doesn’t have to be complicated.

RPB's Imperial Oatmeal Stout
(5 gallon/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.088 FG = 1.032
IBU = 30 SRM = 70 ABV = 8%

Ingredients
14.2 lbs. (6.4 kg) 2-row malt
2.1 lbs. (0.52 kg) chocolate malt
1.5 lbs. (0.68 kg) flaked oats
1.15 lbs. (0.52 kg) Briess Blackprinz® malt
1.75 AAU Cluster hop pellets (first wort hop) (0.25 oz/7 g at 7% alpha acids)
3.5 AAU Cluster hop pellets (60 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 7% alpha acids)
3.5 AAU Cluster hop pellets (30 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 7% alpha acids)
5 oz. (142 g) lactose powder (0 min.)
Wyeast 2035 (American Lager) or White Labs WLP840 (American Lager) yeast
2⁄3 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Ramp mash bed up through conversion, looking to target 55% real degree of fermentation (RDF). When the grain bed reaches mash out temperature of 168 °F (76 °C), begin the lauter. During the sparge phase, add the first wort hops to the brewpot. This is a 60-minute boil adding the hops at the times indicated and the lactose at the end of the boil. Ferment at 55 °F (13 °C) with lager yeast. After primary fermentation is complete, rack the beer to a secondary and condition for one month. At RPB, the Imperial Oatmeal Stout was then split and aged on varying amounts of vanilla beans and cocoa beans in bourbon barrels for six months. Bottle or keg as normal.

Wyeast 2035 (American Lager) or White Labs WLP840 (American Lager) yeast
2⁄3 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Mix the 2-row pale malt and flaked oats in a large muslin bag and place it in a large brew pot with 4.5 qts. (4 L) water. Heat the grains mixture slowly until the temperature reaches 168 °F (76 °C) over the course of 45–60 minutes.

While the mash is heating, begin heating a separate pot with 3 gallons (11.4 L) water up to 168 °F (76 °C). Add an additional gallon (3.7 L) of water plus the crushed chocolate malt and Blackprinz® malt in a separate muslin bag once the mash has reached 168 °F (76 °C). After roasted grains have steeped for 10 minutes at this temper-ature, remove both grain bags and place in a colander. Slowly pour the remaining 2 gallons (7.8 L) over the grains to wash out the sugars. Bring to a boil, adding the liquid malt extract and first wort hops off heat just prior to reaching a full boil. Stir until extract is fully dissolved. This is a 60 minute boil, adding the hops at the times indicated and the lactose at the end of the boil. Chill the wort and top off the fermenter to 5 gallons (19 L) then aerate the wort heavily and pitch the yeast. Ferment at 55 °F (13 °C) with lager yeast. After primary fermentation is complete, rack to a secondary and condition for one month. At RPB, the Imperial Oatmeal Stout was then split and aged on varying amounts of vanilla beans and cocoa beans in bourbon barrels for six months. Bottle or keg as normal.

(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.090 FG = 1.024
IBU = 82 SRM = 15 ABV = 8.7%

While brewed to be an imperial IPA, the resulting beer tasted more like a hoppy, American barleywine than IPA when it was judged after 7 months of aging.

Ingredients
7.0 lbs. (3.2 kg) English Maris Otter two-row pale malt
7.0 lbs. (3.2 kg) Schreier domestic pale two-row malt
2.0 lbs. (0.91 kg) home-roasted amber malt (using Randy Mosher’s recipe for roasting) (brewers can substitute Victory® malt or Belgian aromatic malt for this ingredient.)
1.5 lbs. (0.68 kg) light Munich malt
0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) domestic wheat malt
0.25 lb. (0.11 kg) Special B malt
0.25 lb. (0.11 kg) Carastan malt

Step by Step
Start by toasting 2 lbs. (0.91 kg) of uncrushed American pale malt. Pre-heat your oven to 350 °F (177 °C). While the oven is heating up, soak the grains in water for about 15 minutes. Lay the grains out on a baking sheet and bake for about 30 minutes or until smelling nutty. If you do not want to bake your own malt, you can substitute in Briess Victory® malt or a Belgian aromatic malt.

This is a single infusion mash for 60 minutes at 153 °F (67 °C) with 6 gallons (23 L) of water treated with 1⁄2 teaspoon of each gypsum and calcium chloride. Sparge with enough water to collect approximately
6.5 gallons (24.6 L) of wort in your brewpot. Add the first wort hops during the sparge phase. Boil for 60 minutes adding the hops according to the schedule. Ferment at 68 °F (20 °C), adding dry hops after seven days
and again at 17 days. Keg your beer at 31 days or bottle and prime with 2 oz. (56 g) dried malt extract.

Partial mash option:
Replace all the Maris Otter pale ale malt, American 2-row pale malt and Carapils® malt with 5 lbs (2.27 kg) Maris Otter liquid malt extract and 3.75 lbs (1.7 kg) light dried malt extract. Toast the 2-row pale malt using the instructions from the all-grain version. Mash the remaining grains in 1.75 gallons (6.6 L) water at 153 °F (67 °C) for 60 minutes. Wash the grains with 2 gallons (7.6 L) hot water. Add in the dried and liquid malt extract and top off the brewpot to 6.5 gallons (24.6 L). Stir to make sure all the malt extract is dissolved then add the first wort hops and bring to a boil. Follow the remaining instructions from the all-grain recipe.

"This recipe was constructed for us by John Strantzen, one of Australia's most successful and generous homebrewers. We've been tweaking it for a decade and seemed to be particularly blessed with this batch — it wasn't an easy decision to offer up bottles for judging!"

Ingredients
3 lb. 12 oz. (1.7 kg) Coopers Stout kit
2 lb. 14 oz. (1.3 kg) light dried malt extract
1 lb. 1.5 oz. (0.5 kg) dark dried malt extract
10.5 oz. (0.3 kg) dextrose
5.5 oz. (0.15 kg) corn syrup
7 oz. (0.20 kg) roasted barley
10.6 oz (0.30 kg) crystal malt
5.3 oz (0.15 kg) chocolate malt
8.1 AAU Fuggles hops (90 mins)(1.8 oz./50 g of 4.5% alpha acids)
4.1 AAU Fuggles hops (15 mins)(0.9 oz./25 g of 4.5% alpha acids)
0.9 oz. (25 g) Fuggles hops (2 mins)
Wyeast 1007 (German Ale) yeast

Step by Step
Steep cracked grains at 154 °F (68 °C) in 2 qts. (2 L) of water for 20 minutes. Carefully strain liquid from steep into brewpot avoiding carry over of any husks. Add rest of the fermentables and add water to make 5.3 qts. (5 L). Boil for 90 minutes, adding hops at indicated times. Cool, transfer to fermenter and top up with water to 19 qts. (18 L). Pitch the yeast at 75 °F (24 °C) and let cool slowly during lag phase. Once fermentation becomes active, control temperature at 64 °F (18 °C). The yeast produces a huge head, so make sure there is plenty of head space in the fermenter. Bottle after one month. Age at judging was 2 years.

Imperial Stout with Dried Mushrooms and Cumaru
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.097 FG = 1.017
IBU = 61 SRM = 80 ABV = 10.6%

Courtesy of Daniel Ropelato, this imperial stout incorporates dried mushrooms and the unique flavors of cumaru seeds (tonka beans).

Ingredients
10 lbs. (4.5 kg) pale ale malt
3 lbs. (1.4 kg) flaked oats
1.5 lbs. (680 g) Caramunich® III malt
2.5 lbs. (1.1 kg) Carafa® III malt
3 lbs. (1.4 kg) Belgian dark candi syrup, D-90
3.7 AAU Challenger hops (first wort hop) (0.5 oz./14 g at 7.5% alpha acids)
7.5 AAU Challenger hops (60 min.) (1 oz./28 g at 7.5% alpha acids)
7.5 AAU Challenger hops (30 min.) (1 oz./28 g at 7.5% alpha acids)
7.5 AAU Challenger hops (10 min.) (1 oz./28 g at 7.5% alpha acids)
1 oz. (28 g) dried porcini mushrooms
8 cumaru beans (or use vanilla extract, to taste)
SafAle S-04, or Wyeast 1028 (London Ale), or LalBrew Nottingham yeast
3⁄4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by step
This recipe uses reverse osmosis (RO) water. Adjust all brewing water to a pH of 5.5 using phosphoric acid. Add 1 tsp. calcium chloride to the mash.

This recipe uses a step mash. In 26 quarts (25 L) water, mash the pale ale malt and flaked oats at 126 °F (52 °C) for 10 minutes. Raise to 156 °F (69 °C) and hold for 120 minutes. Start recirculating wort. Add the Carafa® and Caramunich® malts and raise the temperature to 168 °F (76 °C) for 15 minutes. Sparge slowly and collect 6.5 gallons (24.5 L) of wort.

Boil the wort for 90 minutes, adding hops at the times indicated. First wort hops go in the kettle prior to sparging. Add the candi syrup at the end of the boil and stir well until dissolved.

Chill the wort to 68 °F (20 °C), pitch the yeast, and ferment until complete.

Make a mushroom extract by soaking mushrooms in 100 mL (a little less than half a cup) of vodka while the beer is fermenting. Strain the extract off the mushrooms prior to adding. Make cumaru extract by soaking 8 whole beans in 300 mL of vodka for at least two months. Strain and use to taste; start with about 10 mL. Add the mushroom and cumaru extracts at packaging to taste. Rack the beer, prime, and bottle condition, or keg and force carbonate.

Imperial Stout with Dried Mushrooms and Cumaru
(5 gallons/19 L, extract with grains)
OG = 1.097 FG = 1.017
IBU = 55 SRM = 80 ABV = 10.6%

Ingredients
8.5 lbs. (3.9 kg) pale liquid malt extract
1.5 lbs. (680 g) Caramunich® III malt
2.5 lbs. (1.1 kg) Carafa® III malt
3 lbs. (1.4 kg) Belgian dark candi syrup, D-90
3.7 AAU Challenger hops (first wort hop) (0.5 oz./14 g at 7.5% alpha acids)
7.5 AAU Challenger hops (60 min.) (1 oz./28 g at 7.5% alpha acids)
7.5 AAU Challenger hops (30 min.) (1 oz./28 g at 7.5% alpha acids)
7.5 AAU Challenger hops (10 min.) (1 oz./28 g at 7.5% alpha acids)
1 oz. (28 g) dried porcini mushrooms
8 cumaru beans (or use vanilla extract, to taste)
SafAle S-04, or Wyeast 1028 (London Ale), or LalBrew Nottingham yeast
3⁄4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by step
Use 6.5 gallons (24.5 L) of water in the brew kettle; heat to 158 °F (70 °C).

Steep the malts for 30 minutes. Remove and rinse. Turn off the heat. Add the malt extract and stir thoroughly to dissolve completely. Turn the heat back on and bring to a boil.

Follow the remainder of the all-grain recipe instructions.

Tips for Success:
The brewer called the mushrooms funghi secchi, but that just means dried mushrooms. He said they were Italian; further questioning led me to believe they were porcini mushrooms. I think any earthy, wild mushrooms would work, but porcinis are particularly intense. Specialty or gourmet cooking supply stores carry them.

Cumaru seeds are also called tonka beans in North America and other places (they are quite large, thumb-like in size). If you can’t get your hands on cumaru then use vanilla (cumaru is sometimes called Amazon vanilla, but it has an almond-like aroma). Vanilla extract can be made in the same way as the mushroom extract, or commercial extract (natural, please) can be used. Alternatively, the batch can be split and the base beer dosed with the vanilla and mushrooms directly, then the two batches can be blended to achieve the desired flavor profile.

Dark candi syrup was all that was specified in the recipe so I would use something like D-90 candi syrup. The brewer originally made the syrup at home, so a commercial substitute is recommended.

IBU = 65 SRM = 69 ABV = 9.6%

Ingredients
15.5 lbs. (7 kg) American 2-row pale malt
1.5 lbs. (0.68 kg) Munich malt
1 lb. (0.45 kg) Carafoam® malt
1 lb. (0.45 kg) British chocolate malt (350 °L)
1 lb. (0.45 kg) British crystal malt (65 °L)
1 lb. (0.45 kg) roasted barley
12 oz. (0.34 kg) Carafa® Special III
3 lb. (1.4 kg) Vintner’s Harvest sweet cherry puree
16 AAU Magnum hops (90 min.) (1 oz./28 g at 16% alpha acids)
1.5 lbs. (0.68 kg) Cholaca liquid cacao (original flavor) or 12 oz. (0.34 kg) toasted Ecuadorian cacao nibs
5 Madagascar vanilla beans
Wyeast 1968 (London ESB) or White Labs WLP002 (English Ale) or Lallemand London ESB English-Style Ale yeast
2⁄3 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by step
Several days before brewday, scrape open and cut the 5 vanilla beans into 1-inch (2.5-cm) segments and soak in vodka or Bourbon until ready to add to the secondary.

Mill the grains and mix with 6.8 gallons (25.7 L) of 167 °F (75 °C) strike water to reach a mash temperature of 155 °F (68 °C). Hold this temperature for 60 minutes. If you have soft water, you may want to hold off on adding the roasted grains and British crystal malts until the final 15 minutes of the mash. Vorlauf until your runnings are clear. Sparge the grains with enough water to obtain 7 gallons (26.5 L) of wort. At this point, you may want to test the wort’s gravity. The goal should be to have 7 gallons (26.5 L) of 1.072 SG wort at the start of the boil. You can add dried malt extract (DME) at this point if the SG is low or you may want to wait until the beer is in the fermenter. If you wait to add the DME, be sure to add it after fermentation begins to calm down.

Boil the wort for 90 minutes or more, adding hops according to the ingredient list. After the boil, turn off heat and chill the wort to slightly below fermentation temperature, about 65 °F (18 °C). Aerate the wort with pure oxygen or filtered air and pitch yeast. There should be 5 gallons (19 L) of cooled wort in the fermenter. Be sure to have room in your fermenter for the cherry puree.

Ferment at 66 °F (19 °C) for 10 days (adding the fruit puree on day 6), then raise the temperature to 70 °F (21 °C) for 3–4 days. Carefully rack into a secondary vessel containing Cholaca/cacao nibs and vanilla extract, and age to desired taste. Crash the beer to 35 °F (2 °C) for 48 hours. Bottle or keg the beer and carbonate to approximately 2.25 volumes.

Tips for Success:
Brewer and Co-Founder Ryan Diehl of Imprint Beer Company in Hatfield, Pennsylvania, says he subscribes to the approach of building a luscious, deep chocolate stout that can stand on its own, and then adding elements specific to the individual beer. Diehl recommends Crisp and Fawcett malts for the grist, and strongly suggests a large yeast starter — this gravity level is tough on the yeast! Or, you may want to repitch yeast from a smaller beer such as a mild ale or ESB. This yeast often attenuates better when it gets repitched. He also says they sometimes boil their pastry stouts for two to four hours, but if doing so be sure to adjust your sparge water to account for greater evaporation.

IBU = 30 SRM = 60 ABV = 11.4%

Ingredients
12 lbs. (5.4 kg) American 2-row pale malt
2.5 lbs. (1.1 kg) malted oats
2.5 lbs. (1.1 kg) Weyermann Caramunich® III malt
12 oz. (0.34 kg) chocolate malt
12 oz. (0.34 kg) Briess Midnight Wheat malt
8 oz. (0.23 kg) roasted barley
1 lb. (0.45 kg) lactose

Wyeast 1968 (London ESB), White Labs WLP002 (English Ale), or LalBrew London English-Style Ale yeast
2⁄3 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by step
Mill the grains and mix with 6 gallons (23 L) of 165 °F (74 °C) strike water to reach a mash temperature of 152 °F (67 °C). Hold this temperature for 60 minutes. Vorlauf until your runnings are clear. Sparge the grains with enough water to collect 7 gallons (26.5 L) of wort, add lactose and stir to dissolve. At this point, check the gravity of the wort in the kettle. With that volume, the SG should be 1.073. Add sugar or dried malt extract if your gravity is too low. Boil for 120 minutes, adding hops according to the ingredient list.

After the boil, turn off heat and chill the wort to slightly below fermentation temperature, about 65 °F (18 °C). Aerate the wort with pure oxygen or filtered air and pitch yeast.

Ferment at 66 °F (19 °C) for 10 days, then raise the temperature to 70 °F (21 °C) for 3–4 days. Upon completion of fermentation (check your gravity — being such a "big" beer this may take longer than expected), crash the beer to 35 °F (2 °C) for 48 hours, and bottle or keg the beer and carbonate to approximately 2.25 volumes.

2⁄3 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by step
Pulverize the malted oats as best you can. The more starch you can expose, the faster conversion will take place. Bring 1 gallon (3.8 L) of water to approximately 162 °F (72 °C) and hold there. Steep the malted oats in a fine mesh grain bags for 60 minutes. Begin heating another 1 gallon (3.8 L) to 170 °F (77 °C). Add the remaining crushed specialty grains to another grain bag. Mix both water and specialty grains in with the mashing oats. Steep an additional 15 minutes. Remove the grain bags, placing them in a colander and slowly rinse them with 2 gallons (7.6 L) of hot water. Add liquid extract and lactose while stirring, and stir until completely dissolved. Top up as necessary to obtain 6 gallons (23 L) of wort. Boil for 60 minutes, adding hops according to the ingredient list.

After the boil, turn off heat and chill the wort to slightly below fermentation temperature, about 65 °F (18 °C). Aerate the wort with pure oxygen or filtered air and pitch yeast.

Ferment at 66 °F (19 °C) for 10 days, then raise the temperature to 70 °F (21 °C) for 3–4 days. Upon completion of fermentation (check your gravity — being such a "big" beer this may take longer than expected), crash the beer to 35 °F (2 °C) for 48 hours, and bottle or keg the beer and carbonate to approximately 2.25 volumes.

Tips for success:
Imprint Brewer and Co-Founder Ryan Diehl notes that in the interest of palate "mellowness," you should target about 200 ppm of chloride, adjusting as necessary with calcium chloride. Between the water chemistry and the use of lactose, this recipe allows for a chocolate-forward expression without being overly roasty. Ryan also says that this recipe sells well on its own, but also serves as a fantastic base for their coconut porter (pictured), maple porter, and coffee porters. If pursuing those options, he advises leaving out the lactose.

Indeed Brewing Company: Mexican Honey Imperial Lager clone
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.078 FG = 1.019
IBU = 17 SRM = 6 ABV = 8.2%

This golden-yellow lager with a subtle malt backbone is packed with floral notes of orange blossom and citrus thanks to the use of Mexican orange blossom honey. It has a bright hop flavor and features notes of graham cracker and honeycomb.

Ingredients
6 lbs. (2.7 kg) Pilsner malt
6 lbs. (2.7 kg) Vienna malt
3 lbs. (1.4 kg) Mexican orange blossom honey (whirlpool)
25 AAU Amarillo® hops (5 min.) (2.5 oz./71 g at 10% alpha acids)
Wyeast 2000 (Budvar Lager) or White Labs WLP800 (Pilsner Lager) yeast
2⁄3 cup (133 g) dextrose (if priming)

Step by Step
Mill the grains and mix with 3.75 gallons (14.2 L) of 164 °F (73 °C) strike water to reach a mash temperature of 152 °F (67 °C). Hold this temperature for 60 minutes. Vorlauf until your runnings are clear. Sparge the grains with 3 gallons (11.3 L) water and top up as necessary to obtain 6.5 gallons (25 L) of wort. Boil for 90 minutes, adding hops according to the ingredient list. After removing from heat, stir the wort into a whirlpool, adding/dissolving honey in the process. Let the hot wort settle for 10 minutes. Chill the wort to 48 °F (9 °C), aerate, and pitch yeast. Ferment at 50 °F (10 °C) for 7 days, then let the temperature rise to 60 °F (16 °C) over 7 days. Crash the beer to 35 °F (2 °C) for 48 hours, and bottle or keg the beer and carbonate to approximately 2.25 volumes. After carbonation, lager at near-freezing temperatures for at least six weeks before serving.

Extract option: Substitute the Pilsner and Vienna malts in the all-grain recipe with 4 lbs. (1.8 kg) Pilsen liquid malt extract and 4 lbs. (1.8 kg) Briess Goldpils® Vienna liquid malt extract. Bring 5.4 gallons (20.4 L) of water to approximately 162 °F (72 °C). Add malt extracts while stirring, and stir until completely dissolved. Bring the wort to a boil for 60 minutes. Follow the remaining portion of the all-grain recipe.

Tips for Success:
You may adjust the strength of this beer to your own preference — so long as the ratio of grain to honey is 1 pound of honey for every 4 pounds of grain (0.45 kg of honey for every 1.8 kg of grain). Also, be sure to tightly control the initial fermentation temperatures: With a large infusion of simple sugars from the honey, fermentation can yield fusel alcohols if not properly controlled. Ferment on the cooler side of the lager range to ensure that the beer doesn’t taste "hot."

IBU = 41 SRM = 40 ABV = 4.2%

No reason to reinvent the wheel, but maybe just give it some new rims? This recipe takes the traditional Irish dry stout and adds a small amount of both black malt and chocolate malt for a more complex dark malt flavor that will add intrigue at every sip.

Ingredients
6.25 lbs. (2.8 kg) British pale ale malt
1.75 lbs. (0.8 kg g) flaked barley
8 oz. (400 g) roasted barley (500–600 °L)
3 oz. (85 g) black malt (450–625 °L)
3 oz. (85 g) chocolate malt (330–400 °L)
8.4 AAU Kent Golding hops (60 min.) (1.7 oz./48 g at 5% alpha acids)
White Labs WLP004 (Irish Ale), Wyeast 1084 (Irish Ale), or SafAle S-04 yeast

Step by Step
Crush the grains and mash in using 1.5 quarts of water to 1 pound of grain (a liquor-to-grist ratio of about 3:1 by weight) and a dough-in temperature of 120 °F (49 °C) if doing a step mash. Hold at 120 °F (49 °C) for 15 minutes. Raise the temperature to 150 °F (66 °C) and hold for 60 minutes before mashing out at 170 °F (76 °C). If you aren’t able to step mash, dough in at 152 °F (67 °C) and hold there until mashing out. Sparge with 170 °F (77 °C) water, collecting wort until your pre-boil volume is around 6 gallons (23 L), or to whatever volume your brew system will allow you to collect 5.25 gallons (20 L) post 60-minute boil.

Add the bittering hops for the full 60-minute boil. Add Irish moss or other kettle finings with 15 minutes left in the boil. When the boil is complete, chill to 65 °F (18 °C) and transfer to your fermenter. Pitch the yeast and aerate if using liquid yeast. Ferment at 65 °F (18 °C) for seven days and then raise the temperature to 72 °F (22 °C) and hold for three days. Carbonate the beer to approximately 1–1.5 volumes and serve at 52–55 °F (11–13 °C).

Partial mash option:
Replace the British pale ale malt with 5.25 lbs. (2.38 kg) pale ale liquid malt extract. Steep 1 lb. (0.45 kg) British pale ale malt and all of the other grains at 150 °F (66 °C) for 60 minutes and squeeze the bag or rinse grains to remove all dark malt goodness before boiling. Follow the remainder of the all-grain recipe.

OG = 1.053 (13.2 °P) FG = 1.014 (3.5 °P)
IBU = 25 SRM = 18 ABV = 5.2%

Ingredients
9.9 lbs. (4.5 kg) Crisp British pale ale malt or similar British pale ale malt
6.0 oz. (170 g) crystal malt (40 °L)
6.0 oz. (170 g) crystal malt (120 °L)
5.0 oz. (142 g) roasted barley (300 °L)
5.25 AAU Kent Golding pellet hops (60 min.) (1.05 oz./30 g at 5% alpha acid)
White Labs WLP004 (Irish Ale), Wyeast 1084 (Irish Ale) or Fermentis Safale US-05 yeast

Step by Step
Mill the grains and dough-in targeting a mash of around 1.5 quarts of water to 1 pound of grain (a liquor-to-grist ratio of about 3:1 by weight) and a temperature of 153 °F (67 °C). Hold the mash at 153 °F (67 °C) until enzymatic conversion is complete. Raise the temperature to mash out at 168 °F (76 °C). Sparge slowly with
170 °F (77 °C) water, collecting wort until the pre-boil kettle volume is around 6.5 gallons (24.6 L) and the gravity is 1.041 (10.3 °P).

The total wort boil time is 90 minutes. Add the bittering hops with 60 minutes remaining in the boil. Add Irish moss or other kettle finings with 15 minutes left in the boil. Chill the wort rapidly to 66 °F (19 °C), let the break material settle, rack to the fermenter and aerate thoroughly. Pitch the yeast. Use 10 grams of properly rehydrated dry yeast, 2 liquid yeast packages, or make an appropriate yeast starter. Ferment the wort at 66 °F (19 °C). When the fermentation is finished, carbonate the beer from 2 to 2.5 volumes.

Extract with Grains Option:
Replace the British pale ale malt with 6.6 lb (3 kg) English pale ale liquid malt extract. I have used a couple of English-type liquid malt extracts with great results. Some shops sell extracts from 100% Maris Otter malt, which might be labeled English or British extract. Always choose the freshest extract that fits the beer style. If you can't get fresh liquid malt extract, it is better to use 5.3 lb. (2.4 kg) dried malt extract instead. The crystal malt I use is from Great Western Malting Co. The roasted barley comes from Briess Malt & Ingredients Co. Feel free to substitute any high quality malt of a similar flavor and color from a different supplier.

Mill or coarsely crack the specialty malt and place loosely in a grain bag. Avoid packing the grains too tightly in the bag, using more bags if needed. Steep the bag in about 1 gallon (~4 liters) of water at roughly 170 °F (77 °C) for about 30 minutes. Lift the grain bag out of the steeping liquid and rinse with warm water. Allow the bags to drip into the kettle for a few minutes while you add the malt extract. Do not squeeze the bags. Add enough water to the steeping liquor and malt extract to make a pre-boil volume of 6.5 gallons (24.6 L) and a gravity of 1.041 (10.3 °P). Stir thoroughly to help dissolve the extract and bring to a boil.

The total wort boil time is 90 minutes. Add the bittering hops with 60 minutes remaining in the boil. Add Irish moss or other kettle finings with 15 minutes left in the boil. For the remainder of this recipe, follow the fermentation and packaging instructions for the all-grain version.

This beer won a bronze medal at the 2014 World Beer Cup. Brewer Tim Stumpf notes that he likes to add a sprinkle of calcium chloride to promote round, smooth maltiness in this beer.

Ingredients
8 lbs. (3.6 kg) German Pilsner malt
3.6 lbs. (1.6 kg) light Munich malt
3.6 lbs. (1.6 kg) Vienna malt
10 oz. (0.3 kg) Caraaroma® malt (130 °L)
6 oz. (170 g) pale chocolate malt (200 °L)
7.5 AAU Perle hops (60 min.) (1 oz./28 g at 7.5% alpha acids)
Wyeast Labs 2000 (Budvar Lager) yeast
3⁄4 cup (150 g) dextrose (if priming)

Step by Step
Mill the grains and mix with 5 gallons (19 L) of 162 °F (72 °C) strike water to reach a mash temperature of 150 °F (66 °C). Hold this temperature for 60 minutes. Vorlauf until your runnings are clear. Sparge the grains with 4 gallons (15 L) and top up as necessary to obtain 6.25 gallons (24 L) of wort. Boil for 90 minutes, adding hops according to the ingredient list. After the boil, chill the wort to slightly below fermentation temperature, about 50 °F (10 °C). Aerate the wort with pure oxygen or filtered air and pitch yeast. Ferment at 52 °F (11 °C) until about 2⁄3 of the way through fermentation (when gravity reads approximately 1.036). At that point, allow temperature to rise to 63 °F (17 °C) to encourage complete fermentation. Once the beer reaches terminal gravity, bottle or keg and carbonate to approximately 2.5 volumes. You may want to cold-crash the beer prior to packaging to 35 °F (2 °C) for 48 hours to improve clarity. After carbonation is achieved, lager for at least four weeks at 35 °F (2 °C) before drinking.

Extract with grains option:
Substitute the Pilsner, Munich, and Caraaroma® malts in the all-grain recipe with 5 lbs. (2.3 kg) Pilsner liquid malt extract and 5 lbs. (2.3 kg) Munich liquid malt extract. Steep crushed grains at approximately 162 °F (72 °C) for 15 minutes in 5.8 gallons (22 L) of water. Remove the grain bags, and let drain fully. Add liquid extract while stirring and top up to 6.25 gallons (24 L). Boil for 90 minutes. Follow the remaining portion of the all-grain recipe.

Step by Step
Mill the grains and dough-in targeting a mash of around 1.5 quarts of water to 1 pound of grain (a liquor-to-grist ratio of about 3:1 by weight) and a temperature of 154 °F (68 °C). Hold the mash at 154 °F (68 °C) until enzymatic conversion is complete. Infuse the mash with near boiling water while stirring or with a recirculating mash system raise the temperature to mash out at 168 °F (76 °C). Sparge slowly with 170 °F (77 °C) water, collecting wort until the pre-boil kettle volume is around 6.5 gallons (25 L) and the gravity is 1.040 (9.9°P).

Total wort boil time is 90 minutes. Add the bittering hops with 60 minutes remaining in the boil. Add Irish moss or other kettle finings with 15 minutes left. Add other hop additions at 10 minutes remaining and flame out. Chill the wort to 67 °F (19 °C) and aerate thoroughly. The proper pitch rate is 9 grams of rehydrated dry yeast, 2 packages of liquid yeast or 1 package of liquid yeast in a 1.5-liter starter.

Ferment at 67 °F (19 °C) until the yeast drops clear. Fermentation should be complete in about one week. Allow the lees to settle and the brew to mature without pressure for another two days after fermentation appears finished. Rack to a keg and force carbonate or rack to a bottling bucket, add priming sugar, and bottle. Target a carbonation level of 2 to 2.5 volumes.

(5 gallons/ 19 L, extract with grains)
OG = 1.070 FG = 1.022
IBU = 27 SRM = 20 ABV = 6.3%

Ingredients
6.6 lbs. (3 kg) Briess golden liquid malt extract
1.8 lbs. (0.8 kg) light dried malt extract
1.5 lbs. (0.68 kg) crystal malt (80 ºL)
3 oz. (91 g) chocolate malt
1⁄2 tsp. Irish moss (15 min.)
1⁄2 tsp. yeast nutrient (15 min.)
8 AAU Northern Brewer pellet hops (60 min.) (1.0 oz./ 28g of 8% alpha acids)
1.25 AAU Willamette pellet hops (0.25 oz./ 7g of 5.0% alpha acids)
White Labs WLP 023 (Burton Ale) or Wyeast 1099 (Whitbread Ale) yeast
3⁄4 cup (150 g) of corn sugar (for priming)

Step by Step
Steep the crushed grain in two gallons (7.6 L) of water at 158 ºF (70 ºC) for 30 minutes. Remove grains from the wort and rinse with 2 quarts (1.9 L) of hot water. Add the liquid and dry malt extracts and bring to a boil. While boiling, add the hops as per the hopping schedule. Add yeast nutrient and Irish moss after 45 minutes. Add the wort to two gallons (7.6 L) of cold water in a sanitized fermenter and top off with cold water up to five gallons (19 L).
Cool the wort to 75 ºF (24 ºC). Pitch yeast and aerate the wort heavily. Allow the beer to cool to 68 ºF (20 ºC). Hold at that temperature until fermentation is complete. Transfer to a carboy, avoiding any splashing to prevent aerating the beer. Let the beer condition for one week and then bottle or keg. Allow to carbonate and condition for two additional weeks and enjoy your Iron Horse Brown Ale.

All-grain option: This is a single step infusion mash. Replace the malt syrup and dry extract with 13.5 pounds (6.1 kg) 2-row pale malt grain and reduce the crystal malt to 1.2 pounds (54 kg). Chocolate malt remains the same. Mix the crushed grain with 3.5 gallons (13 L) of 174 °F (79 °C) water to stabilize at 158 ºF (70 ºC) for 60 minutes. Sparge slowly with 175 ºF (79 ºC) water. Collect approximately six gallons (23 L) of wort runoff to boil for 60 minutes. Reduce the 60 minute hop addition to .75 oz. (21 g) to allow for the higher utilization factor of a full wort boil. The remainder is the same as the extract with grain recipe.

Step by Step
Mill the grains and mix with 5.1 gallons (19.3 L) of 162 °F (72 °C) strike water to reach a mash temperature of 150 °F (68 °C). Hold at this temperature for 60 minutes. Vorlauf until your runnings are clear. Sparge the grains with 3.2 gallons (12.1 L) of 168 °F (75.5 °C) water until 6.5 gallons (24.6 L) of 1.059 SG wort is collected in your boil kettle. Boil for 60 minutes adding hops, yeast nutrient, and kettle finings according to the ingredients list. After the boil, turn off the heat and add the 0-minute hop additions according to the ingredients list. Whirlpool the kettle by gently stirring the wort for 2 minutes and then let it rest for an addition 23 minutes. Chill the wort to 65 °F (20 °C), aerate, and pitch the yeast. The recommended pitch rate is 240 billion yeast cells, which can be obtained by using either 1 vial/packet after making a 1 L stir plate starter, by using 1 vial/packet after making a 2.75 L non-stir plate starter, or by using 2.5 vials/packets without a starter. Ferment between 65 °F (18 °C) and 66 °F (19 °C) for the first three days, then ramp up to 69 °F (20.5 °C) for the remainder of primary fermentation. On day eight, add your first round of dry hops directly to the primary fermenter. On day twelve, add your second round of dry hops to the primary fermenter. On day fifteen, begin to slowly crash cool the fermenter down at the rate of 5°F (2.7 °C) per day for 7 days until the beer reaches 34 °F (1 °C) and then bottle or keg the beer. Carbonate to between 2.2 and 2.3 volumes of CO2 and enjoy!

Extract with grains option:
Substitute the grain bill in the all-grain recipe with 9.75 lbs. (4.4 kg) golden light liquid malt extract, 4 oz. (0.11 kg) honey malt, and 1 tsp. (5 mL) 88% lactic acid. Steep the honey malt in 2 gallons (7.5 L) of 150 °F (66 °C) water along with the lactic acid for 20–30 minutes while you continue to heat the water up to no hotter than 170 °F (77 °C) in order to avoid extracting tannins. Remove grains and top off to 6.5 gallons (24.6 L). Boil for 60 minutes. Follow the remaining portion of the all-grain recipe.

Step by Step
This is a single-step infusion mash. Mill the grains, then mix with the calcium chloride and 23.3 qts. (22 L) of 166 °F (74 °C) strike water to reach a mash temperature of 152 °F (67 °C). Hold this temperature for 60 minutes. Raise the mash temperature through infusion of boiling water or recirculating system up to mash out at 168 °F (76°C). Hold this temperature for 5 minutes, then begin vorlauf. Sparge the grains with enough water to obtain 6.5 gallons (24.6 L) of wort. Boil for 60 minutes, adding hops according to the ingredient list. After the boil, whirlpool for 5 minutes, then let settle for 5 minutes. Chill the wort to about 65 °F (18 °C) and then pitch your yeast.

Once fermentation commences, allow beer to free rise up to 67 °F (20 °C). You can hold this temperature for ten days or until the completion of primary fermentation, whichever is later. Bottle or keg the beer and carbonate to approximately 2.5 volumes.

Partial mash Option:
Replace the pale ale malt with 6.6 lbs. (3 kg) Maris Otter liquid malt extract and omit the rice hulls. Heat 2 gallons (7.6 L) water to 166 °F (74 °C). Place crushed grains in one or more large grain bags and submerge in the water. The temperature of the mash should stabilize at about 152 °F (67 °C). Steep the grains for 60 minutes. Remove the grains and place them in a colander over the brew kettle. Rinse grains with 2 gallons (7.6 L) hot water. Top off your brew kettle to 5 gallons (19 L) then bring wort to a boil. Turn off the heat, add the malt extract and stir thoroughly to dissolve completely. Turn the heat back on and bring to
a boil.

The remainder of this recipe is the same as the all-grain version.

IBU= 35 SRM = 28 ABV = 10.2%

Brick Kiln from Jackie O’s Brewery (Athens, Ohio) is brewed in the English tradition and features rich caramel and raisin notes, with a light herbal presence from noble hops.

Ingredients
10 lbs. (4.5 kg) 2-row malt
6 lbs. (2.7 kg) Maris Otter malt
1.6 lbs. (0.68 kg) Munich malt (10 °L)
1.2 lbs. (0.54 kg) Special B malt
1.2 lbs. (0.54 kg) caramel malt (45 °L)
1 lb. (0.45 kg) white unmalted wheat
4 oz. (113 g) chocolate malt
1/2 tsp. yeast nutrients (10 min.)
3.5 AAU Magnum hops (90 min.) (0.25 oz./7 g at 14% alpha acids)
3.5 AAU Magnum hops (45 min.) (0.25 oz./7 g at 14% alpha acids)
2.4 AAU East Kent Golding hops (30 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 4.75% alpha acids)
2.4 AAU East Kent Golding hops (15 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 4.75% alpha acids)
1 Bourbon barrel or 1-2 oz. (28-57 g) medium toasted oak chips, soaked in Bourbon
Wyeast 1056 (American Ale) or White Labs WLP001 (California Ale) or Safale US-05 yeast
2⁄3 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step

This is a single infusion mash, targeting about 1.15 qts./lb. (2.4 L/kg) water-to-grain mash ratio, about 24.4 quarts (23.1 L). Mash at 152 °F (67 °C) for 45–60 minutes. Sparge with approximately 17 quarts (16.1 L) to collect approximately 7.5 gallons (28 L). Concentrate your wort by boiling for at least two hours, with the goal to end the boil with 5.25 gallons (20 L) in the kettle. Add hops starting with about 90 minutes left in the boil.

When boil is complete, cool and then oxygenate for at least two minutes. Pitch yeast that has been built up in a yeast starter or 2 sachets of dried yeast. Ferment at 68 °F (20 °C) for 2 days, raise to 70 °F (21 °C) on day 3, then free rise on day 4. Keep in primary longer than a normal beer to allow the yeast to finish fermentation and clean up by-products, about 2-4 weeks. If you are not barrel-aging, condition for 3–6 months. If you are Bourbon-barrel aging, you will need to taste periodically to find the proper aging time. Jackie O’s ages theirs for a better part of a year in Bourbon barrels, but you need to determine when it is right for barrel and beer. Carbonate to your personal preference, but 2.2 volumes of CO2 seems appropriate.

Step by Step

Some of the grains need to be mashed (Munich and the white wheat) while the others just need to be steeped. Use two muslin bags and put the Munich and white wheat in one bag, the remaining grains in the other. Put 6.6 quarts (6.2 L) of water in your pot and raise the temperature to 160 °F (71 °C). Submerge the Munich and white wheat in the water, making sure the grains get thoroughly mixed in. Temperature should stabilize at 152 °F (67 °C) and hold there for 30 minutes. Add the second bag with the steeping grains and hold for 15 minutes. When done, place both grain bags in a colander and slowly pour 1.5 gallons (5.7 L) of water to wash the grains. Top off your pot to 6 gallons (23 L) total. Raise to a boil, take the pot off the heat, and add the malt extracts while stirring thoroughly. Boil for 60 minutes. Follow the remainder of the all-grain recipe.

Jack and Ken’s Ale
Sierra Nevada 30th Anniversary Ale Collaboration between Sierra Nevada and Jack McAuliffe from New Albion Brewing
(Black barleywine)
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.101 (24 °P) FG = 1.025 (6.2 °P)
IBU = 80 SRM = 90 ABV = 10.4%

Sierra Nevada put together this recipe in collaboration with Jack McAuliffe from New Albion Brewing (1976–1982) in Sonoma, California using raw materials available in the late 1970s. This was one of four Sierra Nevada 30th Anniversary Collaboration Ales.

Ingredients
20 lbs. (9.1 kg) 2-row pale malt
1 lb. 2 oz. (0.52 kg) caramel malt (60 °L)
5.2 oz. (0.15 kg) roasted barley
13 AAU Brewers Gold hops (60 mins) (1.5 oz./43 g of 8.5% alpha acids)
14 AAU Cluster hops (60 mins) (2 oz./57 g of 7% alpha acids)
1.0 oz. (28 g) Cascade hops (0 mins)
0.75 oz. (21 g) Northern Brewer hops (0 mins)
1.5 oz.(43 g) Cascade hops (dry hop)
1.5 oz. (43 g) Northern Brewer hops (dry hop)
Wyeast 1056 (American Ale), White Labs WLP001 (California Ale) or Fermentis US-05 yeast (7 qt./7 L yeast starter or 18 g dried yeast)

Step by Step 
Heat 6.75 gallons (25 L) of strike water. Mash at 150 °F (66 °C) for 60 minutes. Mash out to 168 °F (76 °C) and hold for 5 minutes. Recirculate and then collect the wort. Fully sparging the grain bed would yield over 11 gallons (42 L) of wort. Decide how much wort you want to collect. (It takes about an hour to boil away a gallon/4 L of liquid on a typical homebrew system). Boil to reduce wort volume to 5 gallons (19 L), adding hops at times indicated. (If you collected less than the full amount of wort, you may need to add malt extract to hit your target OG. Take a hydrometer reading with 10 minutes left in the boil. For every "gravity point" you are low, add 1.8 oz. (51 g) of dried malt extract.) Chill wort and transfer to fermenter. Aerate and pitch sediment from yeast starter. Ferment at 68 °F (20 °C). Dry hop for 1 week.

Ingredients
2.5 lbs. (1.1 kg) 2-row pale malt
1 lb. 2 oz. (0.52 kg) caramel malt (60 °L)
5.2 oz. (0.15 kg) roasted barley
4 lb. 14 oz. (2.2 kg) light dried malt extract
6.0 lbs. (2.7 kg) light liquid malt extract (late addition)
13 AAU Brewers Gold hops (60 mins) (1.5 oz./43 g of 8.5% alpha acids)
14 AAU Cluster hops (60 mins) (2 oz./57 g of 7% alpha acids)
1.0 oz. (28 g) Cascade hops (0 mins)

Wyeast 1056 (American Ale), White Labs WLP001 (California Ale) or Fermentis US-05 yeast

Step by Step 
Mash grains at 150 °F (66 °C) for 60 minutes. (One option is to put the 4 lbs./1.8 kg of grain in a grain bag and place the bag in a 2.0-gallon/7.6-L insulated beverage cooler.) Collect wort and sparge grains with hot water (~190 °F/88 °C, but don’t let the temperature of the grain bed rise above 170 °F/77 °C). (If you are using the beverage cooler option, collect one cup of wort from the spigot, then add one cup of hot sparge water to the top of the cooler and repeat until you collect around 2.0 gallons (7.6 L) of wort.) Add water to wort to make at least 3.5 gallons (13 L) of wort, stir in dried malt extract and bring to a boil. Boil for 60 minutes, adding hops at times indicated. Stir in liquid malt extract during the final 15 minutes of the boil. (Stir well to avoid scorching malt extract.) Cool wort and transfer to fermenter. Top up to 5.0 gallons (19 L) with cool water, aerate well and pitch yeast. Ferment at 68 °F (20 °C). Dry hop for 1 week.

Ingredients
0.5 lbs. (0.23 kg) 2-row pale malt
1 lb. 2 oz. (0.52 kg) caramel malt (60 °L)
5.2 oz. (0.15 kg) roasted barley

1.5 oz. (43 g) Northern Brewer hops (dry hop)
Wyeast 1056 (American Ale), White Labs WLP001 (California Ale) or Fermentis US-05 yeast

Step by Step
Place grains in a steeping bag. In a large (at least 4 qt/4 L) kitchen pot, steep grains at 150 °F (66 °C) for 60 minutes in 2.7 qts. (2.6 L) of water. Begin heating at least 3.0 gallons (11 L) of water in your brewpot as the grains steep. Rinse grains with 1.5 qts. (1.4 L) of 170 °F (77 °C) water and add "grain tea" to water in brewpot. Stir in dried malt extract and bring wort to a boil. Boil for 60 minutes, adding hops at times indicated. Stir in liquid malt extract during the final 15 minutes of the boil. (Stir well to avoid scorching malt extract.) Cool wort and transfer to fermenter. Top up to 5.0 gallons (19 L) with cool water, aerate well and pitch yeast. Ferment at 68 °F (20 °C). Dry hop for 1 week.

Tips for Success
This is a big beer, so pitching an adequate amount of yeast is critical. If you make a simple yeast starter (not continuously stirred and/or continuously aerated), it should optimally be about 7 qts. (7 L). You can get by with one half this size, but don’t go any lower than that. If you aren’t going to make a starter, use just short of two 11-g sachets of dried yeast.

Adding some yeast nutrients in the final 15 minutes of the boil is not a bad option and be sure to aerate your wort well. In addition, watch that your fermentation temperature doesn’t rise too high.

Hoponius Union is a lager that features a blend of popular American hops, creating a huge tropical fruit and citrusy hop aroma. A dry finish accentuates the pleasant bitterness and hop profile.

INGREDIENTS
10.5 lb. (4.5 kg) 2-row pale malt
1.6 lb. (0.73 kg) Munich malt (9°L)
9 oz. (255 g) Weyermann Carabelge malt (12°L)
9 oz. (255 g) spelt berries
3.3 AAU Magnum pellet hops (60 mins.) (0.25 oz./7 g at 13% alpha acids)
16.5 AAU Centennial pellet hops (5 mins.) (1.5 oz./43 g at 11% alpha acids)
22 AAU Centennial pellet hops (0 mins.) (2 oz./57 g at 11% alpha acids)
26 AAU Citra pellet hop s (0 mins.) (2 oz./57 g at 13% alpha acids)
1.5 oz. (43 g) Centennial pellet hops (dry hop)
1.5 oz. (43 g) Citra pellet hops (dry hop)
White Labs WLP830 (German Lager), Wyeast 2124 (Bohemian Lager), White Labs WLP029 (German Ale/ Kölsch), or Wyeast 2565 (Kölsch) yeast
3/4 cup (150 g) dextrose (if priming)

STEP BY STEP
Mash the grains at 148°F (64°C) for 90 minutes. Mash out, vorlauf, and then sparge at 168°F (76°C). Boil for 60 minutes, adding hops at the times indicated. At the end of the boil, remove from heat and add the 0-minute hops. Begin a whirlpool and let settle for about 20 minutes. At the end of the 20 minutes, cool the wort to yeast pitching temperature, 65°F (18°C) if using a Kölsch strain and 50°F (10°C) if using the lager strain. Pitch the yeast and ferment at 65°F (18°C) for the Kölsch strain and 50 to 55°F (10 to 12°C) for the lager str ain. Dry hop at the same temperature and then lager at 32°F (0°C) for 3 weeks. Bottle or keg as usual.

PARTIAL MASH OPTION:
Substitute 7 pounds (3.2 kg) golden light liquid malt extract for the 2-row malt and scale the Weyermann Carabelge malt down to 8 ounces (227 g). Place the crushed grains in a large nylon bag. Mix grains with 1 gallon of 158°F (70°C) water to achieve a stable mash temperature at 148°F (64°C) and hold for 60 minutes. Raise temperature of the mash either by direct heat or adding boiling water to 168°F (76°C) and hold for 5 minutes. Remove the grain bag and place in a colander. Slowly pour 1 gallon (3.8 L) hot water over the grains. Add the liquid malt extract off heat, then add water in your brewpot until you have about 6 gallons (23 L) of wort in your kettle, then bring up to a boil. Boil for 60 minutes. Follow remaining portion of all-grain recipe.

This is my attempt to brew a historic Michelob. I have read many historical accounts that indicate that back in the 1800s beers often had higher final gravities than present day beers. Since there are no brewing logbooks for Michelob from those days I have no knowledge what the specific gravities were for a Michelob of that timeframe. These numbers are therefore the values achieved in my homebrewed version.

Ingredients
9.5 lbs. (4.3 kg) Rahr Premium Pilsner malt
9 AAU Styrian Golding hops (75 min.) (2 oz./57 g at 4.5% alpha acids)
0.6 AAU Strisselspalt hops (20 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 1.2% alpha acids)
1.8 AAU Czech Saaz hops (20 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 3.6% alpha acids)
0.6 AAU Strisselspalt hops (0 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 1.2% alpha acids)
1.8 AAU Czech Saaz hops (0 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 3.6% alpha acids)
Wyeast 2007 (Pilsen Lager) or White Labs WLP840 (American Lager) yeast
4 oz. (113 g) corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step

Mill the grains and dough-in targeting a mash of around 1.5 quarts of water to 1 lb. of grain (3.1 L/kg) and a temperature of 154 °F (68 °C). Hold the mash at 154 °F (68 °C) for one hour. Sparge slowly with 170 °F (77 °C) water collecting the wort until the pre-boil volume is around 6.5 gallons of wort; tailor the amount to account for your boil off rates.

The total wort boil time is 75 minutes, which helps to reduce the SMM (S-methyl methionine) present in lightly kilned Pilsner malt and results in less DMS (Dimethyl Sulfide) in the finished beer. Add the hops according to the ingredients list, and add Irish moss or other kettle finings with 15 minutes left in the boil. After the boil is complete, turn off heat, add the final addition of hops, give the wort a stir to create a whirlpool, and let settle for 10 minutes. Chill the wort to 50 °F (10 °C) and aerate thoroughly. Pitch the yeast.

Ferment around 50 °F (10 °C). Fermentation should be complete in two weeks or less, but don’t rush it. If desired, perform a diacetyl rest during the last few days of active fermentation. Rack the beer to a secondary and lager for around 6 weeks. Bottle or keg after the lagering process.

Wyeast 2007 (Pilsen Lager) or White Labs WLP840 (American Lager) yeast
4 oz. (113 g) corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step

Add enough water to the malt extract to make a pre-boil volume of around 6.5 gallons (25 L); tailor the amount to account for your boil off rates. Stir thoroughly to dissolve the extract and bring to a boil. The total wort boil time is 60 minutes. Add the hops according to the ingredients list, and add Irish moss or other kettle finings with 15 minutes left in the boil. Chill the wort to 50 °F (10 °C) and aerate thoroughly. Pitch yeast. Ferment around 50 °F (10 °C). With healthy yeast, fermentation should be complete in two weeks or less, but don’t rush it. Now follow the remaining steps of the all-grain recipe for lagering and packaging.

Step by Step
Feel free to substitute any high quality malt of a similar flavor and color from a different supplier than what is listed. Dextrose is also known as corn sugar and should be available from your homebrew supply shop.

Mill the grains and dough-in targeting a mash of around 1.5 quarts of water to 1 pound of grain (a liquor-to-grist ratio of about 3:1 by weight) and a temperature of 149 °F (65 °C). Hold the mash at 149 °F (65 °C) until enzymatic conversion is complete. Infuse the mash with near boiling water while stirring or with a recirculating mash system raise the temperature to mash out at 168 °F (76 °C). Sparge slowly with 170 °F (77 °C) water, collecting wort until the pre-boil kettle volume is around 7.1 gallons (27 L) and the gravity is 1.081 (19.6 °P). If you should come up short on the pre-boil gravity, top it off with some pale malt extract.

The total wort boil time is 120 minutes. This helps concentrate the wort and aids in the development of flavor compounds. The first hop addition comes with 60 minutes remaining in the boil. Add the Irish moss or other kettle finings with 15 minutes left in the boil. Add the last hop additions at flame out.

Chill the wort to 68 °F (20 °C) and aerate thoroughly. The proper pitch rate is 19 grams of properly rehydrated dry yeast, 4 packages of liquid yeast, or 1 package of liquid yeast in a 8 liter starter. Ferment at 68 °F (20 °C) to start, raising the temperature gradually to 70 °F (21 °C) for the last 1⁄3 of fermentation. When finished, carbonate the beer to approximately 2 to 2.5 volumes. You might be tempted to drink this early, but try to hold off until the beer has some age. Once it is carbonated, set aside as much as you can in a cool, dark place. Try some every six months to see how it is progressing and you will be able to enjoy it over the years.

Step by Step
Mill or coarsely crack the specialty malt and place loosely in a grain bag. Avoid packing the grains too tightly in the bag, using more bags if needed. Steep the bag in about 1 gallon (~4 liters) of water at roughly 170 °F (77 °C) for about 30 minutes. Lift the grain bag out of the steeping liquid and rinse with warm water. Allow the bags to drip into the kettle for a few minutes while you add the malt extract. Do not squeeze the bags. Add enough water to the steeping liquor and malt extract to make a pre-boil volume of 7.1 gallons (27 L) and a gravity of 1.081 (19.6 °P). Stir thoroughly to help dissolve the extract and bring to a boil.

The total wort boil time is 120 minutes. This helps concentrate the wort and aids in the development of flavor compounds. The first hop addition comes with 60 minutes remaining in the boil. Add the Irish moss or other kettle finings with 15 minutes left in the boil. Add the last hop additions at flame out. Chill the wort to 68 °F (20 °C) and aerate thoroughly. Follow the fermentation and packaging instructions for the all-grain version.

Ingredients
5 lbs. (2.27 kg) Belgian 2-row malt
3 lbs. (1.36 kg) unmalted red or white wheat
4 oz. (0.11 kg) biscuit malt
1 oz. (28 g) chocolate wheat malt
5 AAU German Hallertau hops (60 mins) (1 oz./28 g 5% alpha acid)
0.5 oz (14 g) (whirlpool) Czech Saaz
Belgian Wit, Saison, or Abbey Ale yeast
3/4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
This recipe calls for a turbid mashing schedule. For more information on turbid mashing, click here. Heat 2.5 qt. (2.4 L) of strike water to 138 °F (59 °C). Dough-in grain at 113 °F (45 °C) for 10 minutes. Raise temp of mash to 136 °F (58 °C) by the addition of 3.75 qt. (3.5 L) of boiling water, hold 5 minutes.

Drop in stuykmanden and draw off about 1 qt. (1 L) of liquid. Heat the drawn off or turbid portion to between 180 - 212 °F (82 - 100 °C). Raise temperature of mash to 150 °F (66 °C) by the addition of 5.2 qt. (4.9 L) of boiling water and hold 30 minutes. Drop in stuykmanden and draw off about 1 gal. (3.8 L) of liquid into the turbid portion. Re-raise temperature of turbid portion to between 180 - 212°F (82 - 100 °C).

Raise temperature of mash to 162 °F (72 °C) by the addition of 5.2 qt. (4.9 L) of boiling water and hold 20 minutes. Drop temperature of turbid mash to 176 °F (80 °C).

Drain the free liquid in the mash tun to the kettle as if you were batch sparging. Gently pour the turbid portion over the grains to bring the mash temperature to 167 °F (75 °C), hold for 20 minutes.

Lauter as normal. Boil 60 minutes. Whirlpool hops at the end of the boil. Ferment on the warmer end of your yeast strain’s range.

OG = 1.082 (19.7 °P)
FG = 1.021 (5.3 °P)
IBU = 23 SRM = 19 ABV = 8.1%

Ingredients
8.8 lb. (4 kg) Best Malz dark wheat malt (8 °L)
4.4 lb. (2 kg) Best Malz Pilsner malt (2 °L)
2.2 lb. (1 kg) Best Malz Munich malt (8 °L)
7.1 oz. (200 g) Franco-Belges caramel Munich malt (40 °L)
7.1 oz. (200 g) Castle Special B malt (120 °L)
3.5 oz. (200 g) Thomas Fawcett pale chocolate malt (200 °L)
5.36 AAU Hallertau pellet hops (60 min.) (1.34 oz./38 g at 4% alpha acids)
Wyeast 3068 (Weihenstephan Weizen) or White Labs WLP300 (Hefeweizen Ale) yeast

Step by step
Mill the grains and dough-in targeting a mash of around 1.5 quarts of water to 1 pound of grain (a liquor-to-grist ratio of about 3:1 by weight) and a temperature of 152 °F (67 °C). Hold the mash at 152 °F (67 °C) until enzymatic conversion is complete. Infuse the mash with near boiling water while stirring or with a recirculating mash system raise the temperature to mash out at 168 °F (76 °C).

Sparge slowly with 170 °F (77 °C) water, collecting wort until the pre-boil kettle volume is around 6.5 gallons (24.4 L) and the gravity is 1.062 (15.3 °P).
The total wort boil time is 90 minutes, which helps reduce DMS in the finished beer and increases melanoidin formation. Add the bittering hops with 60 minutes remaining in the boil. I skip using kettle finings in this beer. Chill the wort rapidly to 62 °F (17 °C), let the break material settle, rack to the fermenter, pitch the yeast and aerate thoroughly. The proper pitch rate is three packages of liquid yeast or one package of liquid yeast in an appropriate starter.

Ferment at 62 °F (17 °C) until the beer attenuates fully. With healthy yeast, fermentation should be complete in a week, but don’t rush it. The cooler than average ale fermentation temperature can extend the time it takes for complete attenuation. Rack to a keg and force carbonate or rack to a bottling bucket, add priming sugar, and bottle. Target a carbonation level of 2.5 to 3 volumes.

Step by step
I have used a number of wheat and Munich malt extracts with good results. Feel free to use whatever your shop recommends. If you can’t get Munich extract, you can do a partial mash with Munich malt instead. If you can’t get fresh liquid malt extract, it is better to use an appropriate amount of dry malt extract (DME) instead. I use Best Malz Pilsen, dark wheat, and Munich malt. The Caramel Munich 40 is from Franco-Belges, the Special B from Castle, and the pale chocolate from Thomas Fawcett. Feel free to substitute any high quality malt of a similar flavor and color from a different supplier. My hops are in pellet form and come from Hopunion.

Mill or coarsely crack the specialty malt and place loosely in a grain bag. Avoid packing the grains too tightly in the bag, using more bags if needed. Steep the bag in about 0.5 gallon (~2 liters) of water at roughly 170 °F (77 °C) for about 30 minutes. Lift the grain bag out of the steeping liquid and rinse with warm water. Allow the bags to drip into the kettle for a few minutes while you add the malt extract. Do not squeeze the bags. Add enough water to the steeping liquor and malt extract to make a pre-boil volume of 5.9 gallons (22.3 liters) and a gravity of 1.069 (16.7 °P). Stir thoroughly to help dissolve the extract and bring to a boil.

The total wort boil time is 60 minutes. Add the bittering hops with 60 minutes remaining in the boil. I skip kettle finings for this beer. Chill the wort rapidly to 62 °F (17 °C), let the break material settle, rack to the fermenter, pitch the yeast and aerate thoroughly. The proper pitch rate is three packages of liquid yeast or one package of liquid yeast in an appropriate starter. Ferment at 62 °F (17 °C) until the beer attenuates fully. With healthy yeast, fermentation should be complete in a week, but don’t rush it. The cooler than average ale fermentation temperature can extend the time it takes for complete attenuation.

New England IPA
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.070 FG = 1.018
IBU = 74 SRM = 4 ABV = 6.9%

Ingredients
10 lbs. (4.5 kg) Great Western Full Pint malt
2.5 lbs. (1.13 kg) malted oats
2.5 lbs. (1.13 kg) Best Malz Chit malt
1.7 lbs. (0.77 kg) white wheat malt
1 oz. (28 g) Columbus hops (mash hop)
8.2 AAU Columbus hops (60 min.) (0.53 oz./15 g at 15.5% alpha acids)
27.6 AAU Amarillo® hops (1st hop stand addition) (3 oz./84 g at 9.2% alpha acids)
31 AAU Bravo hops (2nd hop stand addition) (2 oz./56 g at 15.5% alpha acids)
2 oz. (56 g) Citra® hops (1st dry hop)
2 oz. (56 g) Galaxy® hops (2nd dry hop)
1 oz. (28 g) Citra® hops (2nd dry hop)
1 tsp. Irish moss (15 min.)
0.25 g Rapidase Revelation (fermenter)
SafAle S-04 or Wyeast 1318 (London Ale III) or RVA 132 (Manchester Ale) yeast
0.5 g VIN 7 wine yeast
3⁄4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Starting with reverse osmosis (RO) water, add calcium chloride and calcium sulfate to achieve 150 ppm chloride and 100 ppm sulfate. Mash in the grains and mash hops to achieve a stable mash temperature at 158 °F (70 °C). Hold at this temperature for 60 minutes, then begin mash-out process. Sparge with enough water to collect 7 gallons (26.5 L) in the kettle. Bring wort to a boil for 60 minutes, adding the second hop addition as the wort comes to a boil and Irish moss with 15 minutes left in the boil.

After the boil is over, chill the wort down to 200 °F (93 °C) and stir in the first hop stand addition. After 10 minutes, check wort temperature. Add the second hop stand addition when wort temperature is 185 °F (85 °C); some additional chilling may be required if wort is still warmer than this. After another 10 minutes begin chilling the wort all the way down to yeast pitch temperature. Aerate the wort and transfer into a sanitized fermenter.

Ferment at 66–68 °F (19–20 °C). On day 1, add the Rapidase Revelation enzymes. On day 4, add the first dry-hop addition. After 3 days, rack the beer into a CO2-purged vessel such as a keg or carboy.

After fermentation is complete (7–10 days) soft crash the beer to 58 °F (14 °C) to encourage the yeast and first hop addition to settle out. After a day or two at 58 °F (14 °C), rack to a CO2-purged keg with the second dry-hop addition, purging the hops and the keg at the same time. Alternatively, you can add the second dry-hop addition to the primary fermenter, but purge the headspace with 10 PSI of CO2 while adding the hops to prevent oxygen exposure. Wait 2–3 days and package the beer as normal or serve out of the keg with the hops if they are placed in a fine mesh bag or a dry hop canister to prevent the keg from clogging while dispensing.

After tasting JC’s roggenbier, I asked him for some tips and he generously shared his recipe, as all great brewers are willing to do. The recipe below is a slightly simplified version of his and makes an excellent roggenbier.

Ingredients
6 lb. (2.72 kg) Dingemans or Briess rye malt (3.5 °L)
2.75 lb. (1.25 kg) Durst or Weyermann Pilsner malt (1.8 °L)
2.75 lb. (1.25 kg) Durst or Weyermann Munich malt (8 °L)
0.9 lb. (408 g) Weyermann Caramunich® III malt (60 °L)
2 oz. (57 g) Weyermann Carafa® Special II (430 °L)
3.32 AAU Tettnang pellet hops (60 min.) (0.83 oz./24 g at 4% alpha acids)
0.875 AAU Czech Saaz pellet hops (15 min.) (0.25 oz./7 g at 3.5% alpha acids)
Wyeast 3068 (Weihenstephan Weizen) or White Labs WLP300 (Hefeweizen Ale) or Lallemand Munich Classic yeast

Step by Step
Mill the grains and dough-in targeting a mash of around 1.5 quarts of water to 1 pound of grain (a liquor-to-grist ratio of about 3:1 by weight) and a temperature of 154 °F (68 °C). Hold the mash at 154 °F (68 °C) until enzymatic conversion is complete. Infuse the mash with near boiling water while stirring or with a recirculating mash system raise the temperature to mash out at 168 °F (76 °C). Sparge slowly with 170 °F (77 °C) water, collecting wort until the pre-boil kettle volume is around 6.5 gallons (24.4 L) and the gravity is 1.042 (10.5 °P).

The total wort boil time is 90 minutes, which helps reduce the S-methyl methionine (SMM) present in the lightly kilned Pilsner malt and results in less DMS (dimethyl sulfide) in the finished beer. Add the bittering hops with 60 minutes remaining in the boil. Add Irish moss or other kettle finings and the last hop addition with 15 minutes left in the boil. Chill the wort rapidly to 62 °F (17 °C), let the break material settle, rack to the fermenter, pitch the yeast and aerate thoroughly.

Ferment at 62 °F (17 °C) until the yeast drops clear. With healthy yeast, fermentation should be complete in a week, but don’t rush it. The cooler than average ale fermentation temperature can extend the time it takes for the beer to attenuate fully. Rack to a keg and force carbonate or rack to a bottling bucket, add priming sugar, and bottle. Target a carbonation level of 2.5 to 3 volumes.

Partial Mash Option:
The Munich and Pilsner malts get replaced with 3.8 lb (1.72 kg) of a Munich extract blend (50/50 or 60/40 is fine). The rye malt needs to be converted via a mash. Crush the rye and other grains and place crush grains in a steeping bag. Heat 10 quarts (~ 9.5 L) to 160 °F (71 °C), add grain bag, and let steep for approximately one hour. Rinse out the grains and proceed as normal, adding the extract and water to the steeping liquor.

(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.038 FG = 0.999
IBU = 12 SRM = 3  ABV = 5%

"Das Uberkind is our most used and versatile barrel-aged beer. We blend it with fresh, hoppy beer to make Das Wunderkind! We use it as the base beer for most of our fruit refermentation beers, and we also package it as a standalone beer." – Garrett Cromwell, Head Brewer, Jester King Brewery

Ingredients
6.8 lbs. (3.1 kg) 2-row pale malt or Pilsner malt
0.66 lb. (300 g) unmalted wheat
0.33 lb. (150 g) dark Munich malt
0.33 lb. (150 g) flaked oats
3 AAU Golding hops (60 min.) (0.6 oz./17 g at 5% alpha acids)
Wine-soaked oak staves or cubes (prior use is preferred)
Wyeast 3711 (French Saison) yeast
Wyeast 3724 (Belgian Saison) or White Labs WLP565 (Belgian Saison I) yeast
Wild inoculated bugs from local fruits or flowers
3/4 cup (150 g) dextrose (if priming)

Step by Step
Mash at 154–158 °F (68–70 °C) for 45 minutes using 3 gallons (11 L) strike water. Mash out, vorlauf, and then sparge at 170 °F (77 °C) to collect 6 gallons (23 L). Boil for 60 minutes adding hops at the beginning of the boil. After the boil is finished, chill the wort and oxygenate well. Rack to your fermenter. Pitch the yeast and bacteria and ferment at 78 °F (26 °C) for two weeks. For wood-aging, Jester King generally primary ferments in either stainless or an oak foudre before sending it to smaller, 225-L barrels. Mostly they use neutral wine barrels and find that very subtle oak character complements this delicate beer. You can try to simulate this at home by using oak cubes or staves that have been used once or twice and that have also been soaked in wine. Secondary fermentation takes place at 55–62 °F (13–17 °C). Average fermentation/aging for Das Uberkind is eight to 24 months. Then keg or bottle as you normally would.

Partial mash option:
Reduce the 2-row pale malt in the all-grain recipe to 1 lb. (0.41 kg) and add 3 lbs. (1.36 kg) Pilsen dried malt extract. Mash crushed grains at 154–158 °F (68–70 °C) for 45 minutes using 1 gallon (3.8 L) water. Wash the grains with 1 gallon (3.8 L) hot water. Top off to 6 gallons (23 L) and add the dried malt extract. Stir well then bring to a boil for 60 minutes. Follow the remaining portion of the all-grain recipe.

Tips for Success:
Head Brewer Garrett Cromwell has the following bits of advice to add to the mix: "The specialty malts like Munich, and then flaked oats, rotate based on what we have around the brewery. Sometimes we’ll use spelt, or Maris Otter, or malted wheat etc. For the hops, lately we’ve been adding aged hops for about 30% of our total hop volume with great results. Also we use 100% unaltered well water for all of our beer. It’s pretty high in bicarbonates, but we absolutely love it. For yeast, we use a mixed culture of different yeast and bacteria for all fermentations. These include Dupont yeast, and Thiriez saison yeast, along with a multitude of yeast and bacteria from flowers around our brewery, spontaneous fermentation slurries, etc. These were all blended together one time, and have been evolving as a cohesive culture since being used in our brewery. We maintain this culture in-house. Bottle dregs from any of our beers would be best to approximate the fermentation character we achieve."

Top off to 5 gallons (19 L) then add malt extract, gypsum (optional), and 1 oz. (28 g) Cascade hops and boil for 30 minutes. Add the 0.5 oz. (14 g) Cascade hops and boil 15 more minutes. Add Irish moss and boil 12 more minutes. Add 0.25 oz. (7 g) hops and boil three more minutes for a total boil of 60 minutes. Add peaches and ginger and give the wort a long stir to create a whirpool then let settle for 15 minutes.

Cool rapidly to pitching temperature. Pitch with rehydrated lager yeast and leave in primary fermenter for 10 to 14 days. Rack off the fruit and giner, then leave in secondary fermenter for 10 more days. Bottle with dried malt extract.

An optional trick is to add the peaches and ginger to the secondary, but be sure to puree the fruit and you probably will want to pasteurize it as well.

John Courage has an unusual twist for a British beer: It used to be labeled "amber lager" and is still brewed as a lager. It is malty and sweet, with a dry grainy aftertaste.

Ingredients
8.25 lbs. (3.7 kg) pale malt
0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) biscuit malt
0.75 lb. (0.34 kg) crystal malt (30 °L)
4.5 AAU Northern Brewer hops (45 mins) (0.5 oz./14 g of 9% alpha acid)
4 AAU Fuggles hops (5 mins) (1 oz./28 g of 4% alpha acid)
Wyeast 1338 (European lager) or 1742 (Danish lager) yeast (2 qts./~2 L yeast starter)
0.75 cup corn sugar (for priming)

Step by Step
Heat 11 quarts of water to 163 °F (73 ºC), crush the grains and mix into liquor. Hold mash at 152 °F (67 ºC) for 60 minutes. Collect 5 gallons (19 L) of wort, add 1 gallon (3.8 L) of water and bring the wort to a boil. Boil for 60 minutes, adding hops at times indicated in recipe. Cool wort to 55 °F (13 ºC), aerate and pitch yeast. Ferment at 55 °F (13 ºC), transfer prompty to secondary when primary fermentation is over and condition at 40 °F (4 ºC) for three weeks. Prime with dried malt extract and bottle. Age in bottles for four weeks.

Extract with grains option:
Steep biscuit and crystal malts, along with 0.75 lbs. (0.34 kg) of pale malt in 3 qts. (3 L) of water at 150 °F (66 ºC) for 45 minutes. (Omit remaining pale malt.) Rinse grain bag with 1 qt. (~1 L) water at 170 °F (77 ºC). Add water to "grain tea" to make 3 gallons (11 L), add 1.5 lbs. (0.68 kg) of light dried mallt extract and bring to a boil. Boil for 60 minutes. Add hops at times indicated in ingredient list. With 15 minutes remaining in boil, turn off burner and stir in 3.3 lbs. (1.5 kg) light liquid malt extract, then heat for remaining boil time. Cool wort to 55 °F (13 ºC), transfer to fermenter and top up to 5 gallons (19 L). Aerate well and pitch yeast. Ferment at 55 °F (13 ºC). Lager at 40 °F (4 ºC).

This amber ale features a fluffy white head, medium body, and crisp dry mouthfeel.

Ingredients
5 lbs. (2.3 kg) Pilsner malt
3.5 lbs. (1.6 kg) wheat malt
14 oz. (0.4 kg) Munich malt (10 °L)
14 oz. (0.4 kg) flaked corn
8 oz. (0.23 kg) caramel malt (40 °L)
1.3 oz. (37 g) black patent malt
1.3 oz. (37 g) acidulated malt
14 oz. (0.4 kg) dextrose sugar (15 min.)
1.9 AAU Styrian Golding pellet hops (60 min.) (0.36 oz./10 g at 5.4% alpha acids)
2 AAU Saaz pellet hops (60 min.) (0.52 oz./15 g at 3.75% alpha acids)
5.2 AAU UK Fuggle pellet hops (30 min.) (1.15 oz./33 g at 4.5% alpha acids)
2 oz. (57 g) medium toasted oak cubes
White Labs WLP550 (Belgian Ale), Wyeast 3722 (Belgian Ardennes), or White Labs WLP515 (Antwerp Ale) yeast
A wild yeast/souring bacteria mixed culture of your choosing (see "Tips for Success")
2/3 cup (133 g) dextrose (if priming)

Step by Step
Mill the grains (flaked corn doesn’t need to be milled) and mix with 4.25 gallons (16 L) of 160 °F (71 °C) strike water to reach a mash temperature of 150 °F (65.5 °C). Hold at this temperature for 60 minutes. Vorlauf until the runnings are clear. Sparge the grains with 3.25 gallons (12.3 L) of 169 °F (76 °C) water until 6.5 gallons (24.6 L) of 1.041 SG wort is collected in the boil kettle. Boil for 60 minutes adding hops and dextrose according to the ingredients list. Recommended pitch rate is 204 billion yeast cells which can be obtained by using either 1 vial after making a 1-L stir plate starter, a 2 L non-stir plate starter, or simply by pitching 2 fresh vials without making a starter.

After the boil, turn off the heat and whirlpool the kettle by gently stirring for 2 minutes and then let it rest for an additional 8 minutes. Next, chill the wort to 64 °F (18 °C) and transfer the wort into a fermenter. Pitch the yeast, let the temperature free rise up to 67 °F (19.5 °C), and hold it there for 14 days. Rack to a secondary fermenter and pitch the wild yeast and souring bacteria mixed culture as per the ingredients list. Allow the beer to condition for 4–14 months, depending on how much wild and/or sour character you desire. Regardless of the conditioning time you opt for, the oak cubes should be added 4 months prior to bottling. After secondary conditioning, crash cool the fermenter at the rate of 5°F (2.7 °C) per day for 7 days until you reach 32 °F (0 °C) and then bottle or keg the beer. Carbonate to 2.5 volumes of CO2 and enjoy!

Extract with grains option:
Substitute the flaked corn, Pilsner, wheat, Munich and acidulated malts in the all-grain recipe with 1.75 lbs. (0.8 kg) Pilsen liquid malt extract, 2.5 lbs. (1.14 kg) wheat liquid malt extract, and 3 lbs. (1.36 kg) amber liquid malt extract. Place the grains in a grain bag and then add to 2 gallons (7.6 L) of 150 °F (66 °C) water. Allow the grain to steep for 20–30 minutes while you continue to heat the water up to no hotter than 170 °F (77 °C) in order to avoid extracting tannins. Remove the grain bag, top the kettle up with enough pre-heated water to reach a total pre-boil volume of 6.5 gallons (24.6 L), and turn the heat back on. Once you reach a boil, add the malt extract and hops according to the ingredients list. Follow the remaining portion of the all-grain recipe.

Tips for Success:
Jolly Pumpkin makes two batches for this beer; one fermented in a steel fermenter for a week with ale yeast, the other with a lager yeast. The batches are then transferred into the same oak foeder, innoculated with house yeasts and bacterias, and conditioned for one month. The beer is then racked into standard sized oak barrels for three months of additional aging before being re-blended just prior to packaging. On a homebrew scale, if you have two separate temperature controlled fermentation environments and want to brew twice, then by all means use two different strains of yeast. If you don’t, then the lager-like characteristics of the White Labs WLP515 (Antwerp Ale) offers a good compromise. If you have access to a Biere de Mars, then you can try to utilize the bottle dregs (building them up with a multi-stage stir plate starter is recommended) to gain some of JP’s house wild profile. If not, pitch a mixed culture blend into your secondary, such as White Labs WLP655 (Belgian Sour Mix), Wyeast 3278 (Lambic Blend), Wyeast 3763 (Roeselare Blend), East Coast Yeast’s ECY03-B Farmhouse Blend Isolate, or East Coast Yeast’s ECY01 Bug Farm Blend.

"This one of our signature beers, if you will. It is loosely based in the Flanders sour red tradition." — Ron Jeffries

Ingredients
8 lb. 5 oz. (3.8 kg) blend of Pils and pale malts
1.0 lb. (0.45 kg) malted wheat
1 lb. 4 oz. (0.57 kg) Munich malt (10 °L)
13 oz. (0.37 kg) crystal malt (120 °L)
0.50 oz. (14 g) black malt
1 lb. 2 oz. (0.51 kg) dextrose (added to kettle)
4 AAU Hallertau hops or other noble hop (60 min.) (1.0 oz./28 g of 4% alpha acids)
4 AAU Hallertau hops or other noble hop (30 min.) (1.0 oz./28 g of 4% alpha acids)
Wyeast 3763 (Roeselare Ale) blend
1 cup corn sugar (for priming)

Step by Step
Mash the grains at 154°F (68°C) and hold for 60 minutes. Mash out, vorlauf, and then sparge at 170°F (77°C). Boil for 60 minutes, adding the hops at the beginning of the boil and again with 30 minutes remaining. When the boil is finished, chill the wort rapidly to 65°F (18°C). Ferment at 68°F (20°C), then rack to barrel or into a fermenter with oak cubes (or other alternative oak) for aging. Wyeast 3763 (Roeselare Ale) is a blend of lambic cultures, including a Belgian style ale strain, a sherry strain, two Brettanomyces strains, a Lactobacillus culture, and a Pediococcus culture. Wyeast recommends aging beers brewed with this yeast for up to 18 months to get a full flavor profile and for the acidity to develop. Bottle or keg as usual; heavy-duty bottles are recommended.

Extract with grains option:
Omit the 2-row pale and Pilsner malts. Add 1 pound (0.45 kg) Muntons light dried malt extract and 4 pounds 14 ounces (2.2 kg) Muntons light liquid malt extract. Steep the grains in 4.6 quarts (4.4 L) water at 154°F (68°C) for 45 minutes. Rinse with 2.3 quarts (about 2.2 L) of water at 170°F (77°C). Add water to make 3 gallons (11 L), add the dried malt extract, and bring to a boil. Boil for 60 minutes, stirring in the liquid malt extract for the final 15 minutes of the boil. Chill the wort, transfer to your fermenter, and top up with filtered water to 5 gallons (19 L). Follow the remaining portion of the all-grain recipe.

OG = 1.065 FG = 1.006
IBU = 11 SRM = 4 (green) ABV = 6.3%

Ingredients
5.0 lbs. (2.3 kg) 2-row pale malt
3.0 lbs. (1.4 kg) wheat malt
4.0 lbs. (1.8 kg) Jolly Rancher Apple hard candies
3 AAU Saaz hops (aged) (60 mins) (3.0 oz./85 g of 1% alpha acids)
1/4 tsp yeast nutrients
Wyeast 3278 (Lambic Blend) yeast and bacteria
1.25 cups corn sugar (for priming)

Step by step
Mash grains at 150 °F (66 °C) for 60 minutes. Collect 4 gallons (15 L) of wort, add 1.5 gallons (5.7 L) of water and boil for 90 minutes. Boil hops for 60 minutes. (If you don’t have aged hops, just add 3 AAU of any noble German hop.) At the end of the boil, you should have 4 gallons (15 L) of wort at SG 1.049.

Cool wort, transfer to fermenter, aerate and pitch yeast/bacteria blend. Ferment at 70 °F (21 °C). After one week, boil yeast nutrients in 1 gallon (3.8 L) of water and dissolve candies into this liquid. (It takes at least 20 minutes for the candies to fully dissolve.) Cool "candy water" to 70 °F (21 °C) and rack to secondary fermenter. Rack beer from primary into candy water, making 5 gallons (19 L). (Don’t splash or otherwise aerate wort at this stage.) Condition beer in secondary, at 70–75 °F (21–24 °C), for at least 3 months before bottling. You may want to add a small amount

(~1 tsp) of dried ale yeast to the bottling bucket when bottling.

Extract option: Replace 2-row and wheat malt with 2.0 lbs. (0.91 kg) Briess dried wheat malt extract and 3.0 lbs. (1.4 kg) Coopers liquid wheat malt extract. Bring 2.5 gallons (9.4 L) of water to a boil. Dissolve dried malt extract and boil for 60 minutes, adding hops at beginning of boil. With 15 minutes remaining in boil, stir in liquid malt extract. Cool wort, transfer to fermenter and add water to make 4 gallons (15 L). Aerate and pitch yeast/bacteria blend. Follow all-grain instructions for details of fermentation and how to add candies.

Tips for Success:
In order to make the closest beer to Junkyard’s Peanut Butter Bandit, Dan Juhnke recommends focusing on three aspects. The first is for the all-grain brewers. Junkyard tries to hit a mash pH of 5.3, which leads to a kettle pH of 5.0 and a final beer pH of 4.3–4.5. Anything lower than those numbers results in a thin, acrid beer. Your water profile will more than likely vary from theirs but look to add baking soda (NaHCO3) in the mash to counteract the acidity from the roasted grains. The second tip is oxygenation. Use pure oxygen and a sanitized diffuser stone on a low flow rate for up to 1 minute prior to pitching your yeast. Finally, here comes the peanut butter. Dan recommends to "try out as many different products as you can, even try combining things. Always mix things in a test sample before adding them to your batch. 70% of products out there will ruin your beer."

Ingredients
9 lbs. (4.1 kg) North American 2-row brewers malt
14 oz. (397 g) Munich I malt
10 oz. (283 g) Carapils® malt
8 oz. (227 g) acidulated malt
4.5 AAU Centennial hops (60 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 8.9% alpha acids)
2 oz. (57 g) Mosaic® hops (0 min.)
2 oz. (57 g) Simcoe® hops (0 min.)

Step by Step

Two or three days before brew day, make at least a 2-qt. (2-L) yeast starter, aerating the wort thoroughly (preferably with oxygen) before pitching the yeast.

This recipe uses RO water. The mash has a half-teaspoon of gypsum added. On brew day, mash in the malts at 152 °F (67 °C) in 17 qts. (16 L) of water, and hold this temperature for 60 minutes. Sparge slowly with 170 °F (77 °C) water until 6.5 gallons (25 L) of wort is collected.

Boil the full volume of wort for 60 minutes, adding the hops at times indicated in the recipe. The whirlpool hops are added at flameout, stirred, and allowed to steep for 17 minutes before chilling. Chill to 68 °F (20 °C).

Oxygenate, then pitch the yeast starter. Start fermentation at 68 °F (20 °C), allowing to rise to 72 °F (22 °C) until fermentation is complete (about one week). Add the Mosaic® dry hop addition after fermentation starts, and first Simcoe® dry hop addition after three days. The final dry hops are added after fermentation is complete. Prime and bottle condition, or keg and force carbonate.

Step by Step

Two or three days before brew day, make at least a 2-qt. (2-L) yeast starter, aerating the wort thoroughly (preferably with oxygen) before pitching the yeast.

Use 6.5 gallons (25 L) of water in the brew kettle; heat to 158 °F (70 °C).

Place the malt in a mesh bag, and steep in the hot water for 30 minutes. Remove the mesh bag, then turn the heat off. Add the malt extracts and stir thoroughly to dissolve the extract completely. You do not want to feel liquid extract at the bottom of the kettle when stirring with your spoon. Turn the heat back on and bring to a boil. Boil the full volume of wort for 60 minutes, adding the hops at times indicated in the recipe. The whirlpool hops are added at flameout, stirred, and allowed to steep for 17 minutes before chilling. Chill to 68 °F (20 °C).

Oxygenate, then pitch the yeast starter. Start fermentation at 68 °F (20 °C), allowing to rise to 72 °F (22 °C) until fermentation is complete. Follow the dry hopping and packaging schedule from the all-grain recipe.

Tips for success:
If you cannot source the Imperial Yeast A24 (Dry Hop) yeast blend, you could also try to co-inoculate two yeast strains to create your own blend that could hopefully get you in the same ballpark. BYO suggests White Labs WLP644 (Saccharomyces "Bruxellensis" Trois) co-inoculated with White Labs WLP095 (Burlington Ale) yeast as a best fit scenario for the Imperial Yeast A24 blend.

As the former Head Brewer at Kent Falls, a farm brewery that utilizes local ingredients while still distributing beer throughout a diverse market, I was tasked with developing unique, varied beers that took advantage of as many local products as possible. In the Northeast, the options for interesting, one-of-a-kind local malts are a great deal more accessible than the options for unique hop varieties. Several of the malt options we came across immediately caught my eye: Roasted "chocolate" versions of typical adjunct grains like rye and spelt. Chocolate (or "Midnight") wheat has always been one of my favorite grains to employ in a dark beer, as it adds both body and a smooth roasted chocolate character without being overly bitter or acrid. Spelt and rye are even more flavorful, already contributing nutty, toasty flavor notes even in their typical forms. The possibilities for a beer based around chocolate spelt immediately leapt out to me. The intended result was a porter aiming for the classic rich, smooth body, with slightly punched-up chocolate notes. Being that I wanted to focus this beer entirely on unusual grain profiles, I chose to avoid adding any form of actual cocoa to this beer. Instead, this recipe relies on the nutty nuances of spelt, with its smooth roasty characteristics drawn out entirely by the malting process, bolstered by the complex earthy subtleties of chocolate rye. Chocolate spelt and chocolate rye may not be as easy to source as some other specialty grains, but in addition to local variations, they can usually be special ordered from German malt suppliers. The end result of this recipe is a great study in the nearly endless variety of flavors available within the world of beer — even if one sticks to only the traditional core ingredients.

Ingredients
11 lbs. (5 kg) 2-row pale malt
1 lb. (0.45 kg) chocolate spelt malt (270 °L)
8 oz. (225 g) chocolate rye malt (240 °L)
6 oz. (170 g) brown malt (65 °L)
4 oz. (113 g) chocolate wheat malt (440 °L)
6.8 AAU Brewer’s Gold hops (60 min.) (0.75 oz./21 g at 9% alpha acids)
1 oz. (28 g) Brewer’s Gold hops (5 min.)
LalBrew BRY-97 (West Coast Ale), White Labs WLP001 (California Ale), or Wyeast 1056 (American Ale) yeast
2⁄3 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by step
Mash grains at 154 °F (68 °C) for 60 minutes. Begin lautering by bringing the mash up to a mash-out temperature of 168 °F (70 °F) and hold for 10 minutes. Begin recirculating, vorlaufing until the wort runs clear then direct runoff to the boil kettle.

Boil for 60 minutes adding the hops as indicated in the ingredients list. Chill wort and ferment at 69 °F (21 °C) for one week. Keg or bottle and force carbonate as usual.

Tips for Success:
While no special additions are called for in this recipe, this base beer does make for a great springboard for further experimentation. A small addition of cocoa nibs is recommended for a subtle boost to this beer’s chocolate flavor profile. For this variation, add 3 oz. (85 g) cocoa nibs to either primary or secondary after primary fermentation has finished. Let sit for three to four days before packaging.

IBU = 10 SRM* = 3 ABV = 6%

*Both the original gravity and SRM are numbers provided pre-grape addition. If you want to recheck the actual starting gravity, Kent Falls recommends taking a gravity reading from the fermenter after the grapes and wort have had time to incorporate, but prior to the onset of primary fermentation.

Ingredients
9 lbs. (4.1 kg) Pilsner malt
10 oz. (0.28 kg) white wheat malt
2 lbs. (0.9 kg) Cabernet Sauvignon grape pomace
1 lb. (0.45 kg) Cabernet Sauvignon grape must
2 AAU Brewer’s Gold hops (60 min.) (0.25 oz./7 g at 8% alpha acids)

Wyeast 3711 (French Saison) or White Labs WLP590 (French Saison Ale), or LalBrew Belle Saison yeast
3⁄4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Brewing protocol should follow your standard protocol for any light style beer. Mash at 152 °F (67 °C) for 60 minutes. Collect enough wort in the kettle for a 60-minute boil.

Add grape pomace (grape solids left after pressing) and grape must (crushed grapes) to fermenter before transferring wort. Add the last hop addition at the end of the boil and whirlpool for 15 minutes prior to cooling to fermentation temperature. Chill wort then transfer wort onto the grape must and pomace. Pitch yeast and aerate well. Ferment at 74–78 °F (23–26 °C) until gravity is stable. Upon hitting terminal gravity, age for an additional two weeks before packaging. Due to the large amount of particulate found in pomace and must, transferring to a secondary vessel for the final two weeks of aging may be helpful for achieving clarity.

Kentucky Common
Kentucky Common
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.048 FG = 1.012
IBU = 20 SRM = 16.4 ABV = 4.8%

Ingredients
6.5 lbs. (3 kg) US 6-row malt
3.5 lbs. (1.6 kg) flaked maize (corn)
4 oz. (113 g) UK black malt
3 oz. (85 g) UK crystal malt (77 °L)
2 AAU Vanguard hops (first wort hops) (0.4 oz./11 g at 5% alpha acids)
3 AAU Cluster hops (60 min.) (0.4 oz./11 g at 7.5% alpha acids)
0.4 oz. (11 g) Vanguard hops (0 min.)
Wyeast 1056 (American Ale) or White Labs WLP001 (California Ale) yeast
1 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Make a 1-qt. (1-L) yeast starter two or three days before brew day, aerating the wort thoroughly (preferably with oxygen) before pitching the yeast.

On brew day, prepare your ingredients; mill the grain, measure your hops, and prepare your water. This recipe uses reverse osmosis (RO) water. Add 1⁄4 tsp 10% phosphoric acid per 5 gallons (19 L) of brewing water, or until water measures pH 5.5 at room temperature. Add 1 tsp. calcium chloride (CaCl2) to the mash.

On brew day, mash in the 6-row and flaked maize at 131 °F (55 °C) in 15 qts. (14 L) of water, and hold this temperature for 15 minutes. Raise the temperature by infusion or direct heating to 145 °F (63 °C) for 30 minutes, then raise to 158 °F (70 °C) for 15 minutes. Finally, raise to 168 °F (76 °C) to mashout. Add the crystal and black malts, and recirculate for 15 minutes. Fly sparge with 168 °F (76 °C) water until 6.5 gallons (25 L) of wort is collected. Boil the wort for 90 minutes, adding the hops at times indicated in the recipe. First wort hops are added to the kettle before the wort is run off. After adding the final hops when the heat is turned off, let the wort stand for 15 minutes before chilling the wort. Chill to 64 °F (18 °C).

Oxygenate, then pitch the yeast starter. Allow fermentation temperature to rise to no more than 72 °F (22 °C) until fermentation is complete. Rack and allow the beer to drop bright, using crash cooling or fining if necessary. Prime and bottle condition, or keg and force carbonate to 3 to 3.5 volumes.

I used Fawcett black malt (455 °L) and Crisp Crystal 77L malt in this recipe, with US 6-row and flaked maize. I add the dark and crystal malts during recirculation to keep the harsh flavors down. I use minimal water treatments since I prefer the flavor profile of beers without excessive mineral additions. If you mash the dark and crystal malts, you likely will not have to use the phosphoric acid in the mash, but you should still use it in the sparge water.

If you want to perform a single step infusion mash, use a rest temperature of 152 °F (67 °C). Cluster hops are common for bittering but nearly any other hop variety could be used in their place. The flavor and aroma hops should be some kind of noble-type hop, such as Hallertauer, Tettnanger, or Saaz (if using European hops), or my favorite US-grown substitutes, Vanguard, Santiam, and Sterling.

Any relatively neutral, well-attenuating and well-flocculating, aggressively-fermenting ale yeast can work, but you should avoid those that are described as malty or fruity, since those can produce flavors that interfere with the malt flavors. If you want to try a British yeast, I might choose Wyeast 1335 (British II).

IBU = 20 SRM = 16.4 ABV = 4.8%

Ingredients
6.8 lbs. (3.1 kg) light liquid malt extract
4 oz. (113 g) UK black malt
3 oz. (85 g) UK crystal malt (77 °L)
3 AAU Cluster hops (60 min.) (0.4 oz./11 g at 7.5% alpha acids)
2 AAU Vanguard hops (15 min.) (0.4 oz./11 g at 5% alpha acids)
0.4 oz. (11 g) Vanguard hops (0 min.)
Wyeast 1056 (American Ale) or White Labs WLP001 (California Ale) yeast
1 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Use 6 gallons (23 L) of water in the brew kettle; heat to 158 °F (70 °C). Place the black malt and crystal malt loosely in a mesh bag and steep in the hot water for 30 minutes. Remove the mesh bag, then turn the heat off. Add the liquid malt extract and stir thoroughly to dissolve the extract completely. You do not want to feel liquid extract at the bottom of the kettle when stirring with your spoon. Turn the heat back on and bring to a boil. Boil the wort for 60 minutes, adding the hops at the times indicated in the recipe. After adding the final hops when the heat is turned off, let the wort stand for 15 minutes before chilling the wort. Chill to 64 °F (18 °C).

Oxygenate the wort, then pitch the yeast starter. Allow the fermentation temperature to rise to no more than 72 °F (22 °C) until fermentation is complete. Rack and allow the beer to drop bright, using crash cooling or fining if necessary. Prime and bottle condition, or keg and force carbonate to 3 to 3.5 volumes. As is true with the all-grain recipe, just about any hop variety can be substituted for the bittering hop addition, and the flavor and aroma hops should be some kind of noble-type hop.

(5 gallons/19 L, partial mash)
OG = 1.047 FG = 1.009
IBU = 22 SRM = 6 ABV = 4.9%

Ingredients
3.0 lbs. (1.4 kg) Pilsner malt
0.5 lbs. (0.23 kg) Vienna malt
0.5 lbs. (0.23 kg) wheat malt
1.0 lb. (0.45 kg) Muntons Light dried malt extract
2 lb. 13 oz. (1.3 kg) Muntons Light liquid malt extract (late addition)
1⁄4 tsp calcium chloride (60 min.)
1⁄8 tsp yeast nutrients (15 min.)
5.5 AAU Tettnang hops (60 min.) (1.2 oz./35 g of 4.5% alpha acids)
0.25 oz. (7.1 g) Hallertau Hersbrücker hops (15 min.)
Wyeast 2565 (Kölsch) or White Labs WLP029 (German Ale/Kölsch) yeast (3 qt./~3 L yeast starter @ SG 1.035)
1 cup corn sugar (for priming)

Step by Step
In a clean bucket, combine 6.0 gallons (23 L) of very soft (or distilled) water with a teaspoon of calcium chloride and a teaspoon of gypsum (calcium sulfate). Add a Campden tablet (for removal of chloramines), cover loosely and let sit overnight. This is your brewing liquor. Place grain bag with crushed grains in a 2-gallon (7.6-L) beverage cooler. Heat 5.5 qts. (5.2 L) of brewing liquor to 163 °F (73 °C) and stir this into grains. Mash grains, starting at 152 °F (67 °C),
for 30 minutes.

While mash is resting, stir dried malt extract into 1.0 gallon (3.8 L) of brewing liquor in your brewpot and heat to 148 °F (64 °C). Also heat 5.5 qts. (5.2 L) of brewing liquor (for sparge water) to 180 °F (82 °C) in a separate pot. Run off first wort from cooler and pour into brew pot. Continue to hold the temperature at 148 °F (64 °C).

Add sparge water to cooler, rest 5 minutes then run off second wort. Add the second wort to your brewpot and hold at 148 °F (64 °C) for another 10 minutes. (The enzymes from the partial mash wort will continue to work on any remaining degradable carbohydrates from the grain and malt extract, leading to a more fermentable wort.) Add about a half-gallon (1.9 L) of your brewing liquor to your sparge water pot and bring it to a boil. Add calcium chloride and bring wort to a boil. Once you see the hot break form, add hops and boil for 60 minutes.

Every 10 minutes, top up the boil to its original volume (around 2.5 gallons/9.5 L) with boiling water. (This will help minimize wort darkening by keeping the wort from getting too thick. If you can boil more than 2.5 gallons/9.5 L vigorously, do so.) With 15 minutes left in the boil, add the final dose of hops and yeast nutrients.

At the end of the boil, stir in liquid malt extract and let wort steep (with lid on) for 15 minutes before you begin cooling. Cool wort until outside of brewpot is cool to the touch. Combine with cool brewing liquor in your fermenter to make 5 gallons (19 L) of wort at 65 °F (18 °C). Aerate well and pitch yeast sediment from yeast starter. (Note: If don’t make a starter, pitch two — or better yet three — packs of liquid yeast.)

Ferment at 65 °F (18 °C), then rack to secondary and cold condition at 40 °F (4.4 °C) for three weeks or until beer falls clear. Bottle with corn sugar or keg and carbonate to 2.4 volumes of CO2. Serve in a Kölsch glass (stange), if you have one.

Keutebier
Keutebier
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.046 FG = 1.014
IBU = 5 SRM = 3.4 ABV = 4.7%

Ingredients
6 lbs. (2.7 kg) Weyermann Bohemian Floor-Malted Pilsner Malt
1.75 lbs. (0.8 kg) Weyermann Bohemian Floor-Malted Wheat Malt
14 oz. (400 kg) Weyermann Beech-Smoked Barley Malt
6 oz. (170 g) acidulated malt
6 oz. (170 g) instant oatmeal or malted oats
2.5 AAU Hallertauer Perle hops (0.3 oz./11 g at 8.2% alpha acids) (in the mash)
Any German ale yeast (optimal: altbier-style Wyeast 1007 or White Labs WLP036)
3⁄4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step (Two Alternatives)

Medieval mash method (before the invention of the thermometer): Mash in at any tap water temperature, at an approximate liquor-to-grist ratio of 3.5:1 (1.7 qts./lb.). Slowly bring the entire mash to a boil, while stirring almost constantly. Lauter until the liquor surface is level with the top of the mash. Replenish the lautered liquor and boil the mash again. Lauter until the kettle original gravity (OG) is 1.042. Bring wort to
a boil. Boil the wort for 45 minutes, whirlpool for 15 minutes, cool, and ferment at the yeast’s mid-range temperature. Bottle or keg as normal.

Modern mash method (used in Bamberg): Mash-in at 95 °F
(35 °C); rest 5 minutes; raise temperature to 113 °F (45 °C); rest 20 minutes; raise temperature to 126 °F (52 °C); rest 20 minutes; raise temperature to 154 °F (62 °C); rest 20 minutes; raise temperature to 154 °F (68 °C); rest 20 minutes; raise temperature to 162 °F (72 °C); rest 20 minutes; raise temperature for mash-out at 172 °F (78 °C).

Boil the wort for 45 minutes, whirlpool for 15 minutes, cool, and ferment at the yeast’s mid-range temperature. Bottle or keg as normal.

Keutebier
(5 gallons/19 L, partial mash)
OG = 1.046 FG = 1.014
IBU = 5 SRM = 3.4 ABV = 4.7%

Ingredients
3 lbs. (1.36 kg) Pilsen dried malt extract
1.25 lbs. (0.57 kg) wheat dried malt extract
14 oz. (400 kg) Weyermann Beech-Smoked Barley Malt
6 oz. (170 g) instant oatmeal or malted oats
1 tsp. 88% lactic acid
2.5 AAU Hallertauer Perle hops (0.3 oz./11 g at 8.2% alpha acids) (in the mash)
Any German ale yeast (optimal: altbier-style Wyeast 1007 or White Labs WLP036)
3⁄4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Place the crushed grains in a muslin bag. Steep the grains in 2 qts. (2 L) of water at 154 °F (68 °C) for 60 minutes. Remove the grains and slowly wash with 2 qts. (2 L) of hot water. Top off kettle to 5.5 gallons (21 L), then stir in all the dried malt extract while off heat. Once fully dissolved, bring wort to a boil and boil for 30 minutes. When the boil is complete, whirlpool for 15 minutes, cool, and ferment at the yeast’s mid-range temperature. Bottle or keg as normal.

Sensory Evaluation of Test Brew: The color of this keutebier resembles that of rosé wine. There is a slight cherry and herb candy aroma in the nose. On the palate, the low hop content is only faint, which is fitting for a late-medieval interpretation of this style. This makes the beer taste slightly syrupy, with notes of honey and straw. It is also very low in effervescence. Interestingly, even though this brew was judged the least beer-like of the five recreations covered in this article, it was also deemed surprisingly refreshing, especially if served chilled.

Key Lime Session Mead
Key Lime Session Mead
(5 gallon/19 L batch)
OG = 1.054 FG = 0.997 (prior to backsweetening)
ABV: ~7.6%

Ingredients
7.1 lbs. (3.2 kg) mesquite honey
1.75 lbs. (0.8 kg) mesquite honey (for backsweetening)
15 g Lalvin 71B-1122 yeast
18 g BSG Startup™ (yeast re-hydration)
7.5 g BSG Superfood®
2.5 g diammonium phosphate (DAP)
24 fl. oz. (0.7 L) key lime juice
1.6 g potassium metabisulfite
3 g potassium sorbate
1 Tbsp. Sparkalloid
3/4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Place honey in a large fermenting bucket. Add 1.5 gallons (5.7 L) of hot water. Mix until the honey is well diluted. Top off to just shy of 5 gallons (19 L) with cold water and mix well. Mixing is the simplest form of aeration, but if you have a setup to aerate with forced oxygen this can also be used.

Prepare your Startup™ or other yeast re-hydration agent in 12 oz. (340 g) of 110 °F (43 °C) water. Add the yeast when the temperature drops below 104 °F (40 °C). Let it sit for 10 minutes. Add 1 Tbsp. of the prepared must and stir in the yeast. Allow this to sit for another 10 minutes. Activity should be obvious a few minutes after mixing the last time.

Once the temperature of the must and the rehydrating yeast are within 18 °F (10 °C) of each other the yeast can be pitched into the must and the bucket can be sealed with an airlock.

One third of the BSG Superfood® and DAP should be added at 24, 48 and 72 hours after yeast was pitched. A vigorous degassing with a spoon/paddle should be performed before each nutrient addition.

When the mead reaches terminal gravity, rack into a carboy and add the potassium metabisulfite and potassium sorbate. Allow this to sit for 1–2 days to ensure any active fermentation completes. Prepare Sparkalloid in 8 oz. (227 g) of boiled water for clarification purposes. Add the remaining honey (mix with a little hot water to liquefy), key lime juice, and Sparkalloid. Mix well. The gravity at this point should rise to about 1.010.

Once the mead is clear, or as clear as desired, it can be kegged or bottled. Mead can be left still or carbonated to 2–3 volumes of CO2.

IBU = 20 SRM = 4 ABV = 5.2%

For the most part, khorasan functions like any other raw wheat, and can be used in any recipe or style where a small amount of malted or unmalted wheat is called for.

Ingredients
9 lbs. (4.1 kg) 2-row pale malt
1.25 lbs. (0.57 kg) khorasan wheat
2.5 AAU Saaz hops (60 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 5% alpha acids)
7.5 AAU Saaz hops (10 min.) (1.5 oz./43 g at 5% alpha acids)
Lallemand Belle Saison or Wyeast 3711 (French Saison) or White Labs WLP590 (French Saison Ale) yeast
3⁄4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Mill the khorasan wheat to a coarse flour, milling with 2 pounds (0.91 kg) of 2-row pale malt and gelatinizing at 151 °F (66 °C). Once complete, add to mash tun and dough-in with remaining grain. Target a mash of around 1.2 quarts of water to 1 pound of grain (2.5 L/kg), and a temperature of 154 °F (68 °C) using 3.4 gallons (12.8 L) of water at 166 °F (74 °C). Hold at 154 °F (68 °C) until enzymatic conversion is complete, about 60 minutes. In your hot liquor tank, bring 4.4 gallons of water up to 170 °F (77 °C). Sparge slowly with 170 °F (77 °C) water, collecting wort until the pre-boil kettle volume is 6 gallons (23 L). Add 0.5 oz. (14 g) Saaz hops once a boil is reached. Total boil time is 60 minutes. After 50 minutes add 1.5 oz. (43 g) of Saaz hops. Boil 10 more minutes. Chill the wort to 68 °F (20 °C) and aerate thoroughly then pitch yeast. Ferment in primary at 68–74 °F (20–23 °C) for 10 days. Move to a secondary fermenter. Leave in secondary for 14 days or until beer is clear. Keg or bottle as normal.

Killing It NAB
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.013 FG = 1.010
IBU = 16 SRM = 2 ABV = 0.04%

Ingredients
2.1 lbs. (1 kg) Pilsner malt
0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) Vienna malt
0.25 lb. (113 g) crystal malt (20 °L)
1/2 tsp. yeast nutrients (10 min.)
2.1 AAU Perle hops (60 min.) (0.35 oz./10 g at 6% alpha acids)
1.5 oz. (43 g) Saphir hops (0 min.)
SafAle US-05 or LalBrew BRY-97 (West Coast Ale)

Step by Step
You are looking for 85% of the total volume to be water, so roughly 15.8 qts. (15 L). Heat brewing water to 185 °F (85 °C) then add grains slowly. Treat brewing water with acid to adjust pH to 5.2–5.4. Hold for 10 minutes, then begin a 5 minute vorlauf. Sparging is optional. Add water to the kettle to reach boiling volume. Readjust the pH to make sure wort is under 5.6. Boil for 60 minutes with a 20 minute post-boil whirlpool.

Ferment as you normally would, at below 64 °F (18 °C). The goal is to reach a final gravity of ~1.009–1.010. If you want to dry hop, be sure to cold crash prior and dry hopping cold. Be sure that the final pH is under 4 to guard against spoilage organisms. You may consider adding gum arabic or maltodextrin as a body enhancer if needed.

Ingredients
4.2 lbs. (1.9 kg) Weyermann Bohemian Pilsner Malt (1.5–2.5 °L)
5.2 lbs (2.4 kg) Weyermann Munich Malt Type II (9–11°L)
14 oz. (0.40 kg) Weyermann Caramunich® Type II (110–130°L)
0.1 lbs (0.05 kg) Weyermann Carafa® Special Type I (300–340°L)
4.1 AAU Czech Saaz hops (bittering) (1.0 oz./28 g of 4% alpha acid)
1 oz. Czech Saaz hops (flavor/aroma)
1 package of Wyeast 2278 (Czech Pils), White Labs WLP800 (Pils), or White Labs WLP802 (Czech Budejovice Lager); or 0.7 oz. (20 g) dried Fermentis Saflager W-34/70
1 cup light dried malt extract (for priming)

Step by Step
Dough in at about 122 °F (50 °C) and let the mash rest for 30 minutes. Then infuse the mash with near-boiling water, while stirring to avoid hot spots. Infuse until the mash reaches a temperature of about 144 °F (62 °C). Give the mash a 20-minute rest. Repeat the infusion to raise the mash temperature to about 162 °F (72 °C) for another 20-minute rest. Start sparging with near-boiling water until the mash temperature is at 172 °F (78 °C). Then reduce the sparge temperature to the mash-out temperature. Stop the sparge when the kettle gravity is at about 1.044 (11 °P). Boil for 60 minutes. Evaporation losses should raise the density of the wort to the target original gravity of 1.048 (12°P). Add the bittering hops about 20 minutes and the flavor/aroma hops about 40 minutes into the boil.

After shut-down, check the kettle gravity and liquor the wort down if necessary. Let the wort rest about 30 minutes so the trub can settle. Then heat-exchange it to the preferred fermentation temperature of around 53 °F (12 °C). Next, aerate the cool wort and pitch the yeast. Allow about a week for primary fermentation. Rack the brew when the gravity has dropped to about 1.018 (4.5 °P). Then reduce the temperature to 41 °F (5 °C) and let the brew lager for three or four weeks. After a final racking, pressurize it in a Cornelius keg for about two days or add the conditioning agent and bottle it. Store bottles cool for about a week to let the priming agent carbonate the brew. Serve your finished Bohemian Dunkel at about 45 to 50 °F (7 to 10 °C).

Kissmeyer Beer & Brewing: Baltic Porter
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.072 FG = 1.012
IBU = 45 SRM = 27 ABV = 8%

"Medium bodied, dry, with a crisp lager background. Medium bitterness, aroma and flavor dominated by roasted malts, noble hops, and a noticeable but not overpowering smokiness. The taste is rather long, crispy dry with intense roast maltiness, subtly enhanced by the addition of a little bit of raw licorice. Think: Your favorite Baltic porter with some extra layers of smoke, complexity and depth!" — Anders Kissmeyer

Ingredients
9 lbs. 14 oz. (4.5 kg) Pilsner malt
1.3 lbs. (0.58 kg) dark Munich malt
1 lb. (0.45 kg) hand smoked lager malt (using alder as the wood, maximum smoke intensity)
0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) dark crystal malt
6 oz. (0.17 kg) pale wheat malt
6 oz. (0.17 kg) chocolate malt
4 oz. (0.11 kg) black malt
1 lb. (0.45 kg) local honey (0 min.)
0.035 oz. (1 g) raw licorice root (0 min.)
12 AAU Perle hops (60 min.) (1.7 oz./49 g at 7% alpha acids)
1 AAU East Kent Golding hops (30 min.) (0.2 oz./5.7 g at 5% alpha acids)
1 AAU East Kent Golding hops (15 min.) (0.2 oz./5.7 g at 5% alpha acids)

3⁄4 cup (150 g) dextrose (if priming)

Step by Step
Adjust your water to 60 ppm of calcium using calcium chloride (CaCl2). Mash in at 122 °F (50 °C), before raising to a saccharification rest at 147 °F (64 °C) for 45 minutes, then 158 °F (70 °C) for 15 minutes, before mashing out at 172 °F (78 °C). Alternatively, a single infusion mash at 151 °F (66 °C) for 60 minutes is sufficient. Boil 60 minutes with hop additions as specified. Add the honey and raw licorice at the end of the boil. Cool wort to 57 °F (14 °C), aerate, pitch yeast, and then ferment at 57 °F (14 °C) until fermentation is complete (7 to 10 days). Cool beer to 41–46 °F (5–8 °C), leave at this temperature until all traces of sulfur and diacetyl are eliminated (5 to 10 days), then cool to just under 32 °F (0 °C) and cold lager for as long as possible (4 weeks will do, 8 weeks is better, 12 weeks is nice, 16 weeks near optimal). Aim for a carbonation level close to 2.5 volumes of CO2.

Partial mash option: Reduce the Pilsner malt in the all-grain recipe to 3.2 oz. (91 g) and add 2 lbs. (0.91 kg) Pilsner dried malt extract and 4.5 lbs. (2 kg) Pilsner liquid malt extract. Place the crushed grains in a large steeping bag and mash the crushed grains in 5.5 qts. (5.2 L) of water at 151 °F (66 °C) for 60 minutes. Recirculate (if possible) until wort runs clear, then begin running off wort. Rinse grain bed with hot water (around 180–190 °F/82–88 °C, but don’t let the grain bed exceed 170 °F/77 °C) until you have collected roughly 9 qts. (8.5 L) of wort. Add liquid and dried malt extract and water to make 5.5 gallons (21 L). Boil 60 minutes. Follow the remaining portion of the all-grain recipe.

American Gravøl
American Gravøl
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.080 FG = 1.018
IBU = 15 SRM = 7 ABV = 8.2%

This recipe is brewed in a way that I feel pays homage to the ingredients and processes I saw being used in Norway. That’s not to say it doesn’t involve a lot of improvisation. I used kveik given to me by Ivar (which he got from Sigmund Gjernes), but commercially-available kveik (some of which come from Gjernes’ homestead) will result in a tasty beer too. The resulting beer was a highly aromatic and malty beer, dark orange-amber in color. It had very strong notes of smoke, pine, berries, citrus peel, and a rich malt sweetness.

Ingredients
12 lbs. (5.4 kg) Simpsons Best pale ale malt
2.25 lbs. (1 kg) applewood smoked malt
2.25 lbs. (1 kg) cherrywood smoked malt
3.5 AAU Hallertau Mittelfrüh hops (1 oz./28 g at 3.5% alpha acids) (first wort hop)
6–7 small branches of juniper (see Tips for Success)
1 lb. (0.45 kg) apple wood chips
Imperial A44 (Kveiking) or Omega OYL-061 (Voss Kveik) or The Yeast Bay WLP4045 (Sigmund’s Voss Kveik) or LalBrew Voss Kveik yeast
1⁄3 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by step
Prepare mash water by steeping juniper branches and apple wood chips in 7 gallons (26.5 L) of 160 °F (71 °C) water. Let steep for at least one hour to infuse flavor and color, stirring and punching down the cap frequently. If your steeping vessel doesn’t have a false bottom or other means of straining, remove juniper and apple wood chips with long-handled scoop or colander, and set aside.

Heat water to 170 °F (77 °C) for a mash temperature of 160 °F (71 °C). Mash grains for at least two hours at 160 °F (71 °C). (You could mash even longer if you’d like.)

During the long mash, bring sparge water to holding temperature and add back juniper and apple wood chips. Let steep to infuse flavor and color. After mash rest, remove the juniper and wood chips from the sparge water and sparge mash to collect at least 6 gallons (23 L) of wort in boil kettle. Add the first wort hops. Also collect 1–2 cups (240–480 mL) of this wort in a sanitized jar and add kveik flakes; stir several times to reconstitute into a pitchable slurry. Keep this at room temperature, if not warmer.

Boil collected wort for two hours then use a wort chiller (or cool naturally) to 103 °F (39 °C). Pitch rehydrated kveik slurry. Fermentation should start very quickly after (if not almost immediately upon) pitching this mini-starter of kveik slurry.

Allow temperature to drop to 90–95 °F (32–35 °C) and maintain that temperature. Check gravity and temperature every day. My beer fermented to 1.018 in three days with the yeast I used. Condition for one week at least. For packaging, go with a low carbonation level at around 1.5 volumes.

Tips for Success:
Gravøl is what Norwegians call a beer brewed for a funeral. Of course the passing of a loved one is a sad occasion to brew, however, the intense fermentation power of kveik makes it possible to make a beer quickly so that the deceased can be honored with a living brew. I brewed this beer for a dear friend whose father passed in October 2019. I drank and shared about a half-gallon (2 L) of the live beer straight from the fermenter to celebrate the traditional oppskåke I’d learned about in Norway. I bottled two gallons (8 L) of the very young beer between plastic PET bottles and flip-tops, and kegged the remaining beer.

Since I wouldn’t be brewing over an open fire, which would over the long boil impart a smokiness to the wort, I decided to use some apple and cherry wood smoked malt. Instead of the alderwood that is used traditionally in western Norway for steeping in the mash and sparge water, I used applewood chips (yep, the kind that you might use for grilling). I used about one pound (0.45 kg) of chips for the full 5-gallon (19-L) batch, but you could go with more if you’re not seeing a big color difference in your mash or sparge water. I was lucky enough to find a type of juniper tree in a local Minneapolis park that a forest guide friend uses for making wilderness teas so I felt safe using its branches and berries. Note that not all juniper and its relative family of cedar trees are safe to consume. Please take caution with both the juniper and wood chips. For the hops, go with a low-alpha acid variety; hops are not really for flavor here, more for some balance and preservation. We want to highlight the flavors of the kveik, juniper, and wood chips.

Kiwi-Strawberry Melomel
(3.5 gallons/13.2 L)
OG = 1.068

Ingredients
6.5 lbs. (3 kg) light honey (clover is best here)
1/2 tsp. gypsum
1 tsp. citric acid
Prise de mousse yeast
2.2 lbs. (1 kg) fresh, bruised strawberries
5 or 6 peeled and mashed kiwis
1/2 cup corn sugar for priming

Step by Step
Heat honey, gypsum, and citric acid in 3 gals. (11 L) water. Bring to 175 °F (80 °C) and hold for 15 minutes. Chill to 75 °F (24 °C) and pitch with yeast. Seal fermenter and put the mead in a relatively cool (65 to 70 °F/18 to 21 °C) corner. After 10 to 14 days, rack onto strawberries and kiwis. Age on fruit three to four weeks, then rack into a third fermenter. Condition six to eight weeks, then prime with corn sugar and bottle in champagne bottles. Leave the bottled mead undisturbed in a cool, dark place for three months before you even think about trying one. The first one will probably disappoint you. Leave it another three months and try it again. Like bottle-conditioned beer, bottled sparkling mead will cast a considerable amount of sediment, so decant carefully when serving. Age cool for up to a year

This doppelbock is much darker tasting than others, with massive aromas and flavors of fruitcake, port, figs and raisins. Although extremely rich and thick, this beer is readily drinkable which poses a dilemma after a liter or so. There seem to be a lot of German bierkellars that have tilted, uneven floors!

Ingredients
14 lb. 4 oz. (6.5 kg) Munich malt (20 °L)
4 lb. 12 oz. (2.2 kg) Munich malt (10 °L)

This employs a triple decoction mash program. Mash in cold with 2–2.5 qt./lb. (4.2–5.2 L/kg) water. Bring up to 95 °F (35 °C) with direct heat. Pull a third of the mash, boil for 30 minutes. Add back to main mash to bring temperature up to 131 °F (55 °C). Repeat the decoction. Add back to main mash, which should be at 146 °F (63 °C). Repeat decoction, boil longer than first two decoctions. Add back to main mash to raise temperature to 166 °F (74 °C). Let stand a few minutes then move on to lautering and sparge. Wort boil time is 120 minutes. Ferment at 50 °F (10 °C). Lager at 30 °F (-1.1 °C) for four to five months.

Most Munich malt extracts are a made from a mixture of pale malt and Munich malt, so this clone may not be quite as malty as the original.

Ingredients
3 lb. 5 oz. (1.5 kg) Munich malt (20 °L)
11 oz. (0.31 kg) Carafa® Special III malt
10 lbs. (4.5 kg) Munich liquid malt extract

White Labs WLP833 (German Bock) or Wyeast 2487 (Hella-Bock) yeast
0.75 cups corn sugar (for priming)

Step by Step
Put crushed grains in a large nylon steeping bag. Heat 5.5 qts. (5.2 L) of water to 163 °F (73 °C) and pour into your 2.0-gallon (7.6-L) cooler. Slowly submerge grain bag, then open the bag and use a large brewing spoon to ensure that grain mixes completely with the water. Let mash rest, starting at 152 °F (67 °C) for 45 minutes. While mash is resting, heat 0.75 gallons (2.8 L) of water to 152 °F (67 °C) in your brewpot. Also heat 5.5 qts. (5.2 L) of water to 180 °F (82 °C) in a large kitchen pot.

Recirculate your partial mash wort by drawing off a pint or two of wort from the cooler and returning it to the top of the mash. Repeat until wort is clear or 3 quarts (~3 L) have been recirculated. Next, run off entire first wort and add to the hot wort in your kettle. Stir 180 °F (82 °C) water into grains in cooler until liquid level is the same as during the first mash. Let rest for 5 minutes, then recirculate and run off wort as before. Bring wort to a boil, then turn off heat and stir in roughly a third of the liquid malt extract. Resume heating, add bittering hops and boil for 60 minutes. Stir in remaining liquid malt extract with 15 minutes left in boil.

After the boil, put a lid on your brewpot and cool the wort (either in a cold-water bath in your sink or with a wort chiller). Cool until the side of the brewpot no longer feels warm. Rack cool wort to fermenter and top up to 5 gallons (19 L) with cool water. Aerate and pitch yeast. Ferment at 50 °F (10 °C). Lager in secondary at 30 °F (-1.1 °C) for 4–5 months.

Wyeast 1318 (London Ale III) yeast or Omega OYL-052 (Conan) or LalBrew New England yeast
¾ cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Mill the grains, then mix with 4.9 gallons (18.5 L) of 167 °F (75 °C) strike water to achieve a single infusion rest temperature of 152 °F (67 °C). At this time add 50 ppm of gypsum. Hold at this temperature for 60 minutes. Mashout to 170 °F (77 °C) if desired.

Vorlauf until your runnings are clear before directing them to your boil kettle. Batch or fly sparge the mash to obtain 6.5 gallons (25 L) of wort. Pre-boil pH should 5.2 to 5.4. Boil for 90 minutes.

After the boil, add 150 ppm of calcium chloride, cool the wort to approximately 190 °F (88 °C), and add the Citra® hops. Whirlpool for 40 minutes before further chilling the wort to 68 °F (20 °C). Pitch yeast. Maintain rough fermentation temperature but allow for a free rise to 72 °F (22 °C) by the end of primary fermentation for this beer.

Once primary fermentation is complete, rack the beer off the trub or drop the cone at ambient temperature. Add the dry hops sequentially as indicated and let them extract for 1 day each. During this time shake the carboy or degas with CO2 to increase the rate of hop oil extraction. Cold crash for 24 hours before bottling or kegging the beer. Carbonate to approximately 2.3–2.4 volumes.

Follow the remainder of the all-grain recipe instructions for post-boil and fermentation directions.

Tips for Success:
With such a fruity, hop-forward beer, you could correctly assume that water chemistry is quite important. For the all-grain brewer, shoot for a 3:1 ratio of chloride-to-sulfate prior to pitching. Unfortunately, for the extract brewer, you’re at the whims of the maltster. If you’re feeling adventurous, add 50–100 ppm of calcium chloride to tilt the balance to chlorides. Personally, I’d err on the side of caution as too little will still make the batch drinkable but too much may cause it to leave a "chemical" taste on the tongue.

The other major consideration to concern yourself with is the yeast pitch rate. With an OG = 1.076, I’d recommend a fresh starter. A strong, healthy fermentation will afford a well-attenuated beer with proper biotransformation of hop oils.

OG = 1.062  FG = 1.012
IBU = 25  SRM = 12.5  ABV = 6.5%

This traditional Oktoberfest is a classic take on the German style, featuring an amber color and sweet, malty notes.

Ingredients
12 lbs. (5.4 kg) Munich malt (9 °L)
1.25 lbs. (0.56 kg) Victory® malt
10 oz. (0.28 kg) crystal malt (15 °L)
4.5 AAU U.S. Saaz hop pellets (80 min.) (1 oz./28 g at 4.5% alpha acids)
2.4 AAU East Kent Golding hop pellets (30 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 4.75% alpha acids)
1⁄2 tsp. Irish moss (30 min.)
1⁄2 tsp. yeast nutrient (15 min.)
White Labs WLP810 (San Francisco Lager) or Wyeast 2112 (California Lager) yeast
1/2 cup (100 g) dextrose (if priming)

Step by Step
This is a single step infusion mash. Mix all of the crushed grains with 4.6 gallons (17.5 L) of 168 °F (76 °C) water to stabilize at 151 °F (66 °C). This is a medium-thin mash using 1.4 quarts of strike water per pound of grain (2.9 L/kg). This ratio will help to maximize fermentability. Mash for 60 minutes and slowly sparge with 175 °F (79 °C) water. Collect approximately 6.2 gallons (23.5 L) of wort runoff and boil for 80 minutes. While boiling, add the hops, Irish moss, and yeast nutrient as per the schedule. After the boil is complete, cool the wort to 65 °F (18 °C). Pitch your yeast and aerate the wort heavily. Allow the beer to cool to 58 °F (14 °C). Hold at that temperature until fermentation is complete. This may take 12 to 14 days. After fermentation is complete, gently transfer to a carboy, avoiding any splashing to prevent aerating the beer. Allow the beer to condition for an additional week. Prime and bottle condition or keg and force carbonate to 2.2 volumes CO2. Allow the beer to age for at least four more weeks to fully develop the flavors and enjoy your Oktoberfest clone.

Partial mash option:
Reduce the 2-row pale malt in the all-grain recipe to 18 oz. (0.51 kg) and add 6.6 lbs. (3 kg) Briess Munich liquid malt extract. Mash the milled grains in 2.5 gallons (9.5 L) of water at 151 °F (66 °C) for 30 minutes. Remove grains from the wort and rinse with 2 quarts (1.8 L) of hot water. Top your kettle off to 6 gallons (23 L) and boil for 80 minutes. Follow the remaining portion of the all-grain recipe.

4 AAU Hallertauer hops (20 min.) (1.0 oz./28 g of 4.0% alpha acids)
1.0 oz. (28 g) Tettnanger hops (10 min.)
0.5 oz. (14 g) Tettnanger hops (5 min.)
1.5 oz. (43 g) Saaz hops (dry hop)
Wyeast 2206 (Bavarian Lager) or White Labs WLP820 (Octoberfest/Märzen) yeast (make 2–4 L yeast starter)
3/4 cup corn sugar (for priming)

Step by step:
Mash with 4.3 gallons (16.3 L) of strike water at 122 °F (50 °C) for 20 minutes. Raise to 151–153°F (67-68 °C) for 45 minutes. Raise to 170 °F (77 °C) for 10 minutes. Lauter as usual. Bring to a full boil for 90 minutes. You can add a portion of the first Hallertuaer hop addition as a first wort hops during the sparge phase if you so desire. Add second charge of Hallertauer with 20 minutes remaining in boil. Add two charges of Tettnanger hops with 10 and five minutes left in boil, respectively.

Shut down heat, then give your wort a long stir to create a whirlpool. Let settle for 10 minutes. Cool your wort down to yeast pitching temperature. Aerate wort and pitch yeast starter. Ferment at 50 °F (10 °C) for ten days. Raise temperature to 60 °F (16 °C) for 2 days, then rack to secondary for 2 weeks at 32-40 °F (0-5 °C). Dry hop with Saaz hops for 7 days. Prime with corn sugar and bottle or keg and force carbonate.

Extract With Grains Option:
Replace Pilsner malt with 5.75 lbs. of malt extract (such as Weyermann or Durst). Steep light Munich, Carahell and Carafoam in three gallons of water at 150°F. After 30 minutes, remove grain bag and rinse grains with two quarts of warm water. Bring steeping water to boil, add malt extract and a tsp. of 88% lactic acid to the kettle. Shorten the boiling time to 60 minutes. Add 11 AAU of Hallertau hops at the start of the boil instead of 9 AAU of hops for 90 minutes.

OG = 1.048 (11.9 °P) FG = 1.009 (2.3 °P)
IBU= 25 SRM = 4 ABV = 5.1%

Ingredients
9.25 lb. (4.2 kg) Durst continental Pilsner malt (2 °L) or similar
0.5 lb. (227 g) Weyermann Vienna malt (4 °L)
5 AAU Hallertau pellet hops (1.25 oz./35 g at 4% alpha acids) (60 min.)
White Labs WLP029 (German Ale/Kölsch) or Wyeast 2565 (Kölsch) yeast
3/4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Mill the grains and dough-in targeting a mash of around 1.5 quarts of water to 1 pound of grain (a liquor-to-grist ratio of about 3:1 by weight) and a temperature of 149 °F (65 °C). Hold at 149 °F (65 °C) until enzymatic conversion is complete. Raise the temperature to mash out at 168 °F (76 °C). Sparge slowly with 170 °F (77 °C) water, collecting wort until the pre-boil kettle volume is around 6.5 gallons (24.6 L) and the gravity is 1.037 (9.3 °P).

The total wort boil time is 90 minutes, which helps reduce DMS levels in the beer. Add the bittering hops with 60 minutes remaining in the boil. Add Irish moss or other kettle finings with 15 minutes left in the boil. Chill the wort rapidly to 60 °F (16 °C), let the break material settle, rack to the fermenter and aerate thoroughly.

Use 2.5 liquid yeast packages or make a starter with fewer packages. Ferment at 60 °F (16 °C). Lager for at least four weeks before bottling or serving. When finished, carbonate the beer to approximately 2.5 volumes and serve at 50 °F (10 °C).

Kölsch II
Kölsch II
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.049 (12.3 °P) FG = 1.010 (2.6 °P)
IBU = 28 SRM = 3 ABV = 5.2%

Ingredients
9.5 lb. (4.3 kg) Durst Continental Pilsner malt (2 °L) or similar
0.5 lb. (227 g) wheat malt (3 °L)
5 AAU Hallertau pellet hops (60 min.) (1.25 oz./35 g at 4% alpha acids)
2 AAU Hallertau pellet hops (15 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 4% alpha acids)
White Labs WLP029 (German Ale/Kölsch) or Wyeast 2565 (Kölsch) yeast
3/4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Mill the grains and dough-in targeting a mash of around 1.5 quarts of water to 1 pound of grain (a liquor-to-grist ratio of about 3:1 by weight) and a temperature of 149 °F (65 °C). Hold the mash at149 °F (65 °C) until enzymatic conversion is complete. Raise the temperature to mash out at 168 °F (76 °C). Sparge slowly with 170 °F (77 °C) water, collecting wort until the pre-boil kettle volume is around 6.5 gallons (24.4 L) and the gravity is 1.038 (9.6 °P). The total wort boil time is 90 minutes, which helps reduce DMS levels in the beer. Add the bittering hops with 60 minutes remaining in the boil. Add the Irish moss or other kettle finings and the late hops with 15 minutes left in the boil.

Chill the wort rapidly to 60 °F (16 °C), let the break material settle, rack to the fermenter and aerate thoroughly. Use 2.5 liquid yeast packages or make a starter with fewer packages. Ferment at 60 °F (16 °C). Allow the beer to lager for at least four weeks before bottling or serving. When finished, carbonate the beer to approximately 2.5 volumes and serve at 50 °F (10 °C).

Kölsch One and Two
Kölsch One: "1,2,3,4 Kolsch"
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.051 FG = 1.012
IBU = 30 SRM = 4 ABV = 5.1%

I used a bit more hops in the this recipe as they were all very low alpha acids. I think more aroma, less bitterness is better, and using the aroma hops early in first wort hops works for whatever reason to really develop the beer's complexity.

Ingredients
1 lb. (0.45 kg) Weyermann Floor-malted Bohemian Wheat malt
2 lbs. (0.91 kg) Warminster Floor-malted Maris Otter malt
3 lbs. (1.4 kg) Franco Belges Belgian Pilsner malt
4 lbs. (1.8 kg) Weyermann Barke® Pilsner malt
3 oz. (85 g) torrified wheat
3 oz. (85 g) Weyermann acidulated malt
1/2 lb. (0.23 kg) rice hulls
3.8 AAU Mount Hood hops (first wort hop) (1 oz./28 g at 3.8% alpha acids)
1.9 AAU Saaz hops (first wort hop) (1/2 oz./14 g at 2.9% alpha acids)
1.8 AAU Tettnang hops (60 min.) (1/2 oz./14 g at 2.7% alpha acids)
1 oz. (28 g) Saaz hops (15 min.)
1/4 oz. (7 g) Saaz hops (0 min.)
Wyeast 2565 (Kölsch) or White Labs WLP029 (German Ale/Kölsch) or SafAle K-97 or LalBrew Köln yeast
3/4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
I used Martin Brungard’s water recommendation for Kölsch from the May/June 2017 issue of Zymurgy. My water is very hard so I made up ten gallons distilled water with these additions. These amounts are per each five gallon, obviously double for ten:
1 gram gypsum
2 grams Epsom salts
1.25 grams table salt
Calcium lactate, made by reacting 2.7 ml of 88% Lactic acid and 1.5 grams chalk (calcium carbonate).

This is a two step infusion mash, aim for 149–152 °F (65–67 °C), my actual was 150 °F (66 °C) for 60 minutes. Then 158 °F (70 °C) for 15–30 minutes. Mashout at 170 °F (77 °C). Recirculated by hand, slow, continuous sparge, collected over 7 gallons (26.5 L), first running measured 19 °P (1.080 SG), monitored runoff with refractometer, which never dipped below 3 °P (1.012 SG). Performed a 90-minute, vigorous boil, adding hops as indicated in ingredients list. After whirlpool, I chilled with a stainless steel chiller.

I used the Wyeast Kolsch yeast, but I'm sure others would perform well. It was prepared in a two liter starter several days prior on stirplate and chilled. The wort was rapidly chilled to 58 °F (14 °C), then decanted the yeast starter, pitchin the yeast. Finally I aerated the wort by shaking the fermenter.

Fermenter was held at 58 °F (14 °C) for four days, then allowed to come up to room temperature for an additional week. Racked to secondary to find 1.012 SG. Crashed to 38 °F (3 °C) with a 3–4 week cold conditioning. Finally package with by bottle conditioning with priming sugar.

I really do like the technique of first wort hopping, I feel that in such a delicately balanced beer, the hop flavor just seems more integrated without being overbearing.

Kombucha
This is Kombucha Kamp’s short-cut method for brewing up delicious kombucha quickly and safely. Since the yeast and bacteria are temperature-sensitive, the water should be body temperature (about 100 °F/38 °C) or lower before adding the SCOBY. To shorten the wait time, brew a tea concentrate that is then diluted with cool water to bring the temperature down quickly so you can immediately add the SCOBY and starter liquid. This ensures the sweet tea is not left out and potentially exposed to contaminants.

Kombucha
(1 gallon/4 L)

Scale up or down depending on the size of your fermentation vessel.

Equipment
Tea kettle
Fermenting vessel
Cloth cover
Rubber band

Ingredients
1 cup (200 g) sugar
4–6 loose leaf bags of tea (1 bag of tea = 1 tsp
SCOBY
1 cup starter liquid
1 gallon (4 L) purified/bottled water

Step by step
Boil 4 cups of purified water. Add hot water and tea bags to pot or fermenting vessel. Steep 7–15 minutes, then remove tea bags. Add sugar and stir to dissolve. Fill vessel most of the way with purified water, leaving just 1–2 inches (2.5–5 cm) from the top for breathing room with purified cold water. Add SCOBY and starter liquid. Place the cloth over the vessel to cover it and secure the cloth with the rubber band. Place the container in a warm (75–85 °F/24–29 °C is the best range, 80 °F/27 °C is ideal), ventilated area out of direct sunlight and do not disturb for seven days.

After 7 days, or when you are ready to taste your kombucha, gently insert a straw beneath the SCOBY and take a sip. If too tart, then reduce your fermentation cycle next time. If too sweet, allow to ferment for a few more days. Continue to taste every day or so until you reach your optimum flavor preference. Usual fermentation is between 7 and 21 days, depending on desired flavor. An optional next step is to decant and flavor if you would like.

Drink as desired! Start off with 4–8 oz. (120–240 mL) on an empty stomach in the morning, then with meals to help with digestion or as your body tells you it would like some more! Drink plenty of water to flush out any toxins released by the organic acids in kombucha.

Tips for Success:

Small variations in tea or sugar used are not a concern. Increase or decrease the amounts to find the flavor you prefer, but never use less than ¾ cup (150 g) sugar or 3 bags/tsp. of tea per gallon (4 L).

To dechlorinate tap water, if you prefer to use that vs. bottled or purified water, allow to sit out overnight uncovered or boil for
10 minutes and then cool to needed temperature.

Your SCOBY is a living organism — treat it with care and it will be your "booch buddy" for life!

American Imperial Stout
American Imperial Stout
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.130 FG = 1.040
IBU = 60 SRM = 86 ABV = 12%

Our imperial oatmeal stout takes big and bold to the next level. This is a double mashed stout using an intricate malt bill with a lower percentage of base malt and the addition of rye malt as well as de-husked and debittered black malt. This helps to prevent introducing any ashy, smoke, or tannic character to the beer. The resulting beer is a massive imperial stout that will last for years in your cellar.

Ingredients
14.5 lbs. (6.6 kg) 2-row malted barley (55%)2.6 lbs. (1.2 kg) flaked oats (10%)
1 lb. (0.45 kg) Munich dark malt (3.5%)
1.7 lbs. (0.77 kg) Carafa® Special III malt (6.5%)
1.7 lbs. (0.77 kg) chocolate rye malt (6.5%)13 oz. (370 g) roasted barley (3%)
1.7 lbs. (0.77 kg) crystal rye malt (75 °L) (6.5%)
2.4 lbs. (1.1 kg) brown sugar (9%)
19 AAU Warrior hops (90 min.) (1.25 oz./35 g at 15% alpha acids)
1 tsp. yeast nutrient (10 min.)
1⁄2 Whirlfloc tablet (10 min.)
White Labs WLP090 (San Diego Super Strain), Wyeast 1728 (Scottish Ale), or SafAle US-05 yeast
2⁄3 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by step
If starting with soft or reverse osmosis water, add 4 g calcium carbonate per 5 gallons (19 L) of strike water.

This beer is double mashed, meaning you will be mashing twice to get your kettle up to volume. If your mash tun is oversized and can handle it as a single mash, then go that route. Also, the wort will be boiled for 3–4 hours, so whether you double mash or not, be prepared for a long brew day. Knowing your system’s average boil-off rate is helpful to know how much wort to collect in the kettle prior to boiling.

We are essentially looking for just the first runnings to create a monster of a beer. If you are double mashing, mash half the grains in 6 gallons (23 L) of strike water to achieve a mash temperature of 148 °F (64 °C). After the mash is complete, run off to the kettle to about half the total volume required, sparging only if the volume is short. Repeat with the second round of grains to reach full pre-boil kettle volume. An extended boil along with the addition of brown sugar will help boost your gravity to 1.130. It is a good idea to take wort gravity readings over the course of the boil on the hour to monitor how close the wort is to hitting the 1.130 gravity. Add the hops and brown sugar during the final 90 minutes of the boil. Make sure to add more yeast nutrient than normal during the boil.

Your yeast pitch should be 5–6 times the normal pitch rate and be sure to aerate the wort if using a liquid strain or re-pitching yeast. Ferment at 66 °F (19 °C). Note that fermentation temperature can run quite high if not controlled. Keep the beer several degrees below recommended fermentation temperature if using ambient air temperature as the control. Warm up to 72 °F (21 °C) once fermentation begins to show noticeable signs of slowing. Fermentation will take 10–14 days total. Allow at least one month to condition at 55–60 °F (13–16 °C) after either racking off the yeast or dropping yeast from the bottom of the cone.

Transfer to a serving keg or bottle and prime with sugar targeting 2.3 volumes CO2.

Partial mash option: With this much specialty grain, brew-in-a-bag is the way to go. Swap out 12 lbs. (5.4 kg) of the 2-row pale malt for 6.25 lbs. (2.8 kg) extra light dried malt extract. Mash the crushed pale and dark Munich malts and flaked oats in a large brewing bag in 6 gallons (23 L) of water at 148 °F (64 °C). Hold at this temperature for 45 minutes. Add the remaining crushed grains and steep an additional 15 minutes. Remove grains. Top up the kettle to 6.5 gallons (25 L) with water. Off heat add the dried malt extract. Once fully dissolved, bring wort to a boil and boil for 75 minutes adding hops at the beginning of the boil. Follow the all-grain recipe for fermentation and packaging instructions.

Kraig's Chocolate Raspberry Ale
(5 gallons/19 L, extract with grains)
OG = 1.053 FG = 1.012
IBU = 30 SRM = 14 ABV = 5.4%

Ingredients
6.6 lbs. (3 kg) Muntons light liquid malt extract
1 lb. (0.45 kg) crystal malt (20 °L)
4 oz. (113 g) chocolate malt
4 bags (12 oz./340 g) red raspberries (secondary)
6 oz. (170 g) unsweetened, dark chocolate (15 min.)
7.5 AAU Fuggle pellet hops (55 min.) (1.5 oz./43 g at 5% alpha acids)
1 oz. East Kent Goldings pellet hops (5 min.)
Wyeast 1098 (British Ale) liquid yeast
3⁄4 cup corn sugar (for priming)

Step by Step
Mill or coarsely crack the crystal and chocolate grains. Place the grains in one gallon (3.8 L) of water. Heat until 150 °F (66 °C). Remove pot from heat and wait for sparge water to reach 170 °F (77 °C). Sparge into brew kettle.

Add the malt extract to the brew kettle. Increase brew kettle liquid to 3 gallons (11 L). Stir well. Bring liquid to a boil. When 55 minutes remain, add Fuggle hop pellets. When 15 minutes remain, add unsweetened, dark chocolate. Stir well. When 5 minutes remain, add East Kent Goldings pellet hops.

Cool the wort then transfer to the primary fermenter. Add enough clean water to get 5 gallons (19 L) and pitch the yeast.

After two weeks, transfer the beer from the primary to the secondary fermenter on top of the red raspberries. Avoid splashing. Let secondary fermentation go for 2 weeks.

Allow to bottle condition for three to four weeks before serving.

IBU = 50 SRM = 3 ABV = 4.1-5.7% (strain dependent)

For the results from KROC's yeast experiment, visit the full article here

Ingredients
9.5 lbs. (4.3 kg) continental Pilsner malt (2 °L)
9.6 AAU Magnum pellet hops (90 min.)
(1 oz./28 g at 9.6% alpha acids)
6.8 AAU Hersbrucker pellet hops (5–0 min.) (2.25 oz./64 g at 3% alpha acids)
10.8 AAU Spalt pellet hops (5-0 min.) (2.25 oz./64 g at 4.8% alpha acids)
Yeast strain of choice
Priming sugar (if bottling)

Step by Step
We pre-treated our strike water with 0.9 grams/gallon gypsum and 0.6 grams/gallon calcium chloride to promote a healthy fermentation and hop bitterness. Heat 3.5 gallons (13 L) to achieve a stable mash temperature at 150 °F (66 °C). Hold at this temperature until starch conversion is complete. Sparge with 170 °F (77 °C) water, collecting wort until the pre-boil kettle volume is around 6.5 gallons (25 L).

The total wort boil time is 90 minutes adding the Magnum hops at the very beginning of the boil. Mix all the Spalt and Hersbrucker hops together and start to add slowly with 5 minutes remaining in the boil. Space the addition out over the final 5 minutes.

Whirlpool the wort for 20 minutes then chill the wort to desired fermentation temperature and aerate thoroughly. Pitch the yeast of your choice and ferment at recommended temperature, about 52 °F (11 °C) for bottom
fermenting yeast and 68 °F (20 °C) for top fermenting yeast. If using a bottom fermenting yeast, once active fermentation is complete, bring the beer up to diacetyl rest for two days, then slowly chill back to lagering temperature. After proper lagering time (about one month), rack to a keg and force carbonate or rack to a bottling bucket, add priming sugar, and bottle. Target a carbonation level of 2 to 2.5 volumes.

Wyeast 2272 (North American Lager) or White Labs WLP800 (Pilsner Lager) yeast (3 qt./~3 L yeast starter)
3/4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Be sure to start with either soft water or mix with reverse osmosis or distilled water to create a low-carbonate water profile. Mash the grains and maize 12.2 qts. (11.5 L) of water to get a single-infusion mash temperature of 152 °F (67 °C) for 45 minutes (or you could also do a step mash with a 15-minute rest at 122 °F (50 °C) and a 45-minute rest at 152 °F/67 °C). Collect 5.5 gallons (21 L) of wort, add 1 gallon (3.8 L) of water, then boil for 90 minutes. Add hops and Irish moss at times indicated. Cool, aerate, and pitch yeast. Ferment at 50 °F (10 °C) and then lager at 40 °F (4.4 °C) for 2–4 weeks. After fermentation is complete, bottle or keg as usual.

Partial mash option: Substitute 5.75 lbs (2.6 kg) of the 2-row malt in the all-grain recipe with 4 lbs. (0.34 kg) extra light dried malt extract, and reduce the flaked barley to 1 lb. (0.45 kg). Place crushed malt and flaked barley in a nylon steeping bag and steep in 3 qts. (2.8 L) of water at 150 °F (66 °C) for 45 minutes. Rinse grains with 2 qts. (2 L) of water at 170 °F (77 °C). Add water to make 3 gallons (11 L), stir in dried malt extract and bring to a boil for 60 minutes. Add hops and Irish moss as indicated, and the liquid malt extract with 15 minutes remaining in the boil. Cool wort to about 50 °F (10 °C) and transfer to fermenting vessel. Top up to 5 gallons (19 L) with water, aerate and pitch yeast. Follow the remaining portion of the all-grain recipe.

Ingredients
6.6 lbs (3.0 kg) Coopers light malt extract syrup
0.75 lb. (0.34 kg) Dingeman Pilsner malt
0.75 lb. (0.34 kg) Weyermann Pilsner malt
1 tsp. Irish moss
9.0 AAU Northern Brewer hops (60 min.) (1 oz./28 g of 9% alpha acid)
3.5 AAU Czech Saaz hops (20 min.) (1 oz./28 g of 3.5% alpha acid)
4.7 AAU Hallertau Hersbrucker hops (5 min.) (1 oz./28 g of 4.7% alpha acid)
3.5 AAU Czech Saaz hops (5 min.) (1 oz./28 g of 3.5% alpha acid)
White Labs WLP830 (German Lager) or Wyeast 2206 (Bavarian Lager) yeast
O.75 cup of corn sugar (for priming)

Step by Step
Steep crushed grains in 3 gallons (11 L) of water at 150 ºF (66 ºC) for 30 mins. Remove grains from wort, add Northern Brewer hops, malt syrup and bring to a boil. Add Irish moss and boil for 60 mins. Add the first addition of Czech Saaz hops for last 20 mins of boil. Add Hallertau Hersbrucker and final addition of Czech Saaz for last 5 mins. of boil. When done boiling, add wort to 2 gallons (7.6 L) cool water in a sanitary fermenter and top off with cool water to 5.5 gallons (20.9 L). Cool wort to 75 ºF (24 ºC) aerate the beer and pitch yeast. Allow the beer to cool over the next few hours to 65 ºF (18 ºC) and hold until the yeast has started fermentation. When fermentation starts, reduce temperature to 50 ºF (10 ºC) and hold until beer has dropped to final gravity. This should take about 3 weeks. Bottle your beer, lager at 45 ºF (7 ºC) for 4–6 weeks and Enjoy!

All-grain option: Use 4.75 lbs. (2.2 kg) of both Dingeman Pilsner and Weyermann Pilsner malts. Mash grains at 151 ºF (66 ºC) for 60 mins. Boil for 90 mins. Lower the amount of Northern Brewer boiling hops to 0.66 oz. (18.5 grams) to account for higher extraction ratio of a full boil. LaConner Brewing uses the first wort addition method of hopping, so add the Northern Brewer hops to the wort when the runoff is finished, and leave them in the beer during the boil. The remainder of the recipe is the same as the extract.

TIPS FOR SUCCESS:
Brewmaster Jeremy Marshall notes that if you have to "miss" on this recipe, miss on the side of less hops rather than more. Having just finished a bottle of New Dogtown Pale Ale, I can personally verify that the malt character is both delightful and necessary, and overloading it with hops would be a mistake. If your version comes across as overly fruity or lacking in bready malt flavor and aroma, back down the hops until it comes out again!

And for your dry hops, Jeremy has a very specific suggestion: Look for the most oily, dankest Amarillo® you can get and "middle-harvest, citrusy" Simcoe®.

American Oatmeal Stout
American Oatmeal Stout
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.068 FG = 1.014
IBU = 60–65 SRM = 35 ABV = 7%

For the regular strength stout recipe we’ve combined a classic oatmeal stout recipe with an American stout recipe. We keep a similar percent of base malt vs. specialty malt from our session stout, just adding more of everything. We tone down the black and roast malt character and up the chocolate malt character with this recipe. Oats take the place of the flaked barley to help increase the mouthfeel and body. Hopping-wise we’re shooting for just over 60 IBUs. Sticking mainly to American varieties with Simcoe® and Centennial adding flavor and aroma to the beer, we do add a touch of East Kent Golding with 15 minutes left in the boil to add a depth of hop complexity. We’re still looking for the beer to ferment a tad dry, but want to ensure the yeast can get through everything, so we’ll drop the mash temperature down to 154 °F (68 °C) and add extra yeast nutrient. This recipe is very similar in composition to the session stout, but with more pronounced ingredients and bolder flavor and aroma. We’ll use calcium sulphate and calcium chloride to help balance the hops. Otherwise the brewing procedures follow suit with our session stout.

Ingredients
11.5 lbs. (5.2 kg) 2-row pale malt (78%)
1.6 lbs. (0.73 kg) flaked oats (11%)
14 oz. (400 g) chocolate malt (6%)
6 oz. (170 g) roasted barley (2.5%)
6 oz. (170 g) crystal malt (120 °L) (2.5%)
12.8 AAU Warrior hops (75 min.) (0.85 oz./24 g at 15% alpha acids)
2.5 AAU East Kent Golding hops (15 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 5% alpha acids)
0.5 oz. (14 g) Centennial hops (5 min.)0.5 oz. (14 g) Simcoe® hops (5 min.)
1 tsp. yeast nutrient (10 min.)
1⁄2 Whirlfloc tablet (10 min.)
Wyeast 1056 (American Ale), Omega Yeast OYL-004 (West Coast Ale 1), or LalBrew BRY-97 (American West Coast Ale) yeast
2⁄3 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by step
If starting with soft or reverse osmosis water, add 4 g calcium carbonate, 2.5 g calcium sulphate, and 4 g calcium chloride per 5 gallons (19 L) of strike water.

Mash in, targeting a mash temperature at 154 °F (68 °C). Hold here for 60 minutes, then begin the lauter process. Sparge with enough water to collect 7 gallons (26.5 L) of wort in the kettle. Boil for 90 minutes, adding hops, nutrients, and kettle fining per the ingredients list. After the boil is complete, turn off heat, add the final hop addition, then give the wort a long stir to create a whirlpool and let settle for 5 minutes.

Chill wort to 68 °F (20 °C), aerate well if using a liquid yeast strain, then pitch the yeast. Ferment at this temperature for two weeks. Transfer to a serving keg or bottle and prime with sugar targeting 2.3 volumes CO2.

Partial mash option: Swap out 10 lbs. (4.5 kg) of the 2-row pale malt for 5.25 lbs. (2.4 kg) extra light dried malt extract. Steep crushed pale malt and flaked oats in a muslin bag submerged in 2 gallons (7.6 L) water at 154 °F (68 °C) for 45 minutes. Add the remaining crushed grains in a separate muslin bag. Allow those to steep with the grains for another 15 minutes. Remove both grain bags, placing them in a large colander and rinsing them with 1.5 gallons (5.6 L) of hot water. Top up the kettle to 5 gallons (19 L) with water. Off heat add the dried malt extract. Once fully dissolved, bring wort to a boil and boil for 60 minutes. Follow the remainder of the all-grain recipe, topping the fermenter up to 5 gallons (19 L) prior to pitching yeast.

Rolling Rock Extra Pale is the United States leader in a beer using an "off-flavor" to differentiate itself from all of the other American pale lagers. Rolling Rock has made a name for itself by brewing a pale lager with a significant amount of DMS (Dimethyl Sulfide) in its flavor profile. The best way for a homebrewer to get this flavor in your beer is to boil your beer with the lid of your pot covering as much of the kettle as possible without boiling over.

Ingredients
6.5 lbs. (3.0 kg) 6-row pale malt
1 lb. (0.45 kg) flaked rice
1.5 lbs. (0.68 kg) flaked corn
5.6 AAU Willamette hops (60 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 5% alpha acids)
2.25 AAU Tettnanger hops (60 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 4.5% alpha acids)
1/2 teaspoon Irish moss (15 min.)
White Labs WLP840 (American Lager) or Wyeast 2035 (American Lager) yeast
¾ cup (150 g) dextrose (if priming)

Step by Step
Mash grains at 153 °F (67 °C) for 60 minutes. Mash out, vorlauf, and then sparge at 167 °F (75 °C) to collect approximately 7 gallons (26.5 L) of wort. Boil for 90 minutes, with the lid on your kettle while being careful not to cause a boil-over. Add hops at times indicated. Chill to 68 °F (20 °C), aerate, and pitch yeast. Hold beer at 68 °F (20 °C) until the yeast starts fermenting, and then cool to 52 °F (11 °C) for the remainder of fermentation. About 3 days after hitting yoru final gravity, raise the temperature of the beer to about 68 °F (20 °C) for 3 days for a diacetyl rest. Transfer to secondary and lager the beer at about 35 °F (2 °C) for another 3 weeks before bottling or kegging.

Partial mash option:
Reduce the 6-row pale malt in the all-grain recipe to 2 lbs. (0.91 kg), reduce the flaked corn to 1 lb. (0.45 kg), and eliminate the flaked rice. Add 2 lbs. 10 oz. (1.2 kg) light dried malt extract and 0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) rice syrup solids. Steep the 6-row pale malt and flaked corn in a muslin bag in 1 gallon (3.8 L) of water at 150 °F (65 °C) for 45 minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove grains from the wort and rinse with 2 qts. (1.8 L) of 170 °F (77 °C) water and then top the kettle up to 6 gallons (23 L) and add the extracts. Boil for 60 minutes. Follow the remaining portion of the all-grain recipe.

Lawson's Finest Liquids: Double Sunshine clone
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.074 FG = 1.013
IBU = 100+ SRM = 6 ABV = 8%

Double Sunshine is a sought-after "Vermont-style" Double IPA. It’s packed with juicy tropical fruit flavors and bright herbal aromas thanks to the abundance of US-grown Citra hops.

INGREDIENTS
9.5 lb. (4.3 kg) 2-row pale malt
2.5 lb. (1.1 kg) Vienna-style malt
1 lb. (0.45 kg) flaked oats
12 oz. (0.34 kg) carapilsen malt (7–9°L)
6 oz. (0.17 kg) caramunich-type malt (20–30°L)
1 lb. (0.45 kg) dextrose (10 mins.)
10.5 AAU Columbus hops (60 mins.) (0.75 oz./21 g at 14% alpha acids)
12.5 AAU Citra hops (20 mins.) (1 oz./21 g at 12.5% alpha acids)
37.5 AAU Citra hops (5 mins.) (3 oz./84 g at 12.5% alpha acids)
37.5 AAU Citra hops (knockout) (3 oz./84 g at 12.5% alpha acids)
3 oz. (84 g) Citra hops (dry hop)
Fermentis Safale US-05, Lallemand BRY-97, Wyeast 1056 (American Ale), or White Labs WLP001 (California Ale) yeast (as a 3.5 L yeast starter)
3/4 cup (150 g) dextrose (for priming)

STEP BY STEP
A few days before brew day, make a yeast starter. You will need 254 billion healthy yeast cells. Mash at 152°F (67°C) for 45 minutes. Mash out, vorlauf, and then sparge at 170°F (77°C). Boil for 60 minutes, adding the hops as instructed and the dextrose with 10 minutes left in the boil. After the boil is complete, begin a whirlpool in the kettle and let the knockout hops rest in the hot wort for at least 30 minutes before chilling. Chill the wort, pitch the yeast, and ferment at 68°F (18°C) for 1 week. Cool to 55°F (13°C) to settle the yeast. Dump the yeast from the bottom of fermenter or rack to a clean, sanitized vessel. Add the dry hops and let the beer sit for an additional 4 to 7 days at 55–57°F (13–14°C). Bottle or keg as usual.

EXTRACT WITH GRAINS OPTION:
Substitute the 2-row pale malt in the all-grain recipe with 6.6 pounds (3 kg) light liquid malt extract, skip the carapilsen malt, and boost the dextrose up to 1.5 pounds (0.68 kg) (versus 1 pound/0.45 kg in the all-grain recipe). Mix the crushed Vienna-style malt, flaked oats, and caramunich-type malts into 2 gallons (7.6 L) water to achieve a temperature of 152°F (67°C), then hold at this temperature for 45 minutes. Rinse the grains with 2.5 quarts (2.4 L) hot water, add the liquid extract, and bring to a boil. Top off the kettle to 6.5 gallons (25 L). Boil for 60 minutes. Follow the remaining portion of the all-grain recipe.

Tips for Success:
Having a strong and healthy fermentation as well as following good practices during downstream beer handling are key to trying to replicate a beer like Double Sunshine IPA. Be sure to run a clean fermentation and you also need to make sure oxygen has no chance for uptake post fermentation.

Sean Lawson advises homebrewers to, "determine if you have hard or soft water. I recommend John Palmer’s How to Brew for reference. If you have hard water, then cut by at least half with distilled or reverse osmosis (RO). With soft water, a basic guideline for IPAs would be to add equal parts gypsum and calcium chloride to bring total calcium content over 50 ppm." If you homebrew with a water source that is chlorinated, one Campden tablet in 20 gallons (76 L) of water (left overnight) will rid your water of chlorine compounds that can lead to off-flavors in your beer.

For all-grain brewers, a handful of rice hulls in the mash may help you if your brew setup is prone to a stuck mash. Rice hulls are a great tool when using moderate to high percentages of gummy grains such as flaked oats.

Lawson's Finest Liquids Super Session #2 clone
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.050 FG = 1.017
IBU = 47 SRM = 5 ABV = 4.3%

Sean Lawson designed Super Session to be a hoppy, flavorful beer with low alcohol for those times when you are having more than one.

INGREDIENTS
8.6 lb. (3.9 kg) 2-row pale ale malt
1 lb. (0.45 kg) Carapils malt
6 oz. (170 g) crystal malt (10°L)
6 oz. (170 g) Munich malt (10°L)
2.5 AAU Amarillo pellet hops (60 mins.) (0.25 oz./7 g at 10% alpha acids)
5 oz. (142 g) Amarillo pellet hops (0 mins.)
3 oz. (85 g) Amarillo pellet hops (dry hop)
1/2 teaspoon Irish moss (30 mins.)
Wyeast 1056 (American Ale), White Labs WLP001 (California Ale), Lallemand BRY-97, Fermentis Safale US-05, or Mangrove Jack’s M44 (US West Coast) yeast
2/3 cup (130 g) dextrose (if priming)

STEP BY STEP
Mash the grains at 158°F (70°C) for 60 minutes. Raise the mash temperature to 165°F (74°C) and sparge with enough 175°F (79°C) water to collect approximately 6 gallons (23 L) of wort. Boil the wort for 60 minutes. Add the first Amarillo hop addition at the beginning of the boil, primarily as a foam inhibitor. Add the Irish moss for the last 30 minutes. Turn off the burner at the end of the boil and remove the pot from the heat source (if you’re brewing on an electric burner). Add 5 ounces (142 g) of Amarillo hops and stir. After about 3 to 4 minutes, begin using your wort chiller to drop the temperature of the wort to pitching temperature. This addition is a bit tricky, but the goal is to have the large amount of hops in your wort for about 5 minutes after the wort has finished boiling but hasn’t yet cooled to below approximately 150°F (66°C). This extracts a small amount of hop bitterness and a large amount of hop flavor. When you have cooled the wort to about 80°F (27°C), you can strain the wort into a fermenter. Aerate the wort and pitch the yeast. Ferment at 68 to 70°F (20 to 21°C) to help hold the aromatics in the beer. When fermentation is complete, rack the beer off the trub and add the remaining Amarillo dry hop addition. Allow the beer to absorb the dry hop flavors for about 4 days. Bottle or keg as usual.

EXTRACT WITH GRAINS OPTION:
Substitute the 2-row pale ale malt with 3.3 pounds (1.5 kg) Briess light unhopped liquid malt extract and 2.1 pounds (0.95 kg) Briess light dried malt extract. Steep the crushed malts in 2.5 gallons (9.5 L) of water at 155°F (68°C) for 30 minutes. Remove the grains from the wort. Add the malt extracts, stir well to incorporate, and boil for 60 minutes (see the all-grain recipe for notes on hop additions). Chill the wort, transfer to your fermenter, and top up with filtered water to 5 gallons (19 L). Follow the remaining portion of the all-grain recipe.

baking sheets. Toast the flakes for about 20 minutes shaking the sheet every couple of minutes. Use your nose as a guide to know when they are finished.

Place crushed and flaked grains in a grain bag and add to 1 gal (3.8 L) water to achieve a mash temperature of 150 °F (66 °C) for 45 minutes. Rinse the grains with 2 qts. (1.9 L) hot water, and top off kettle to 6 gal. (23 L). Add extract off heat then bring to a boil. After boil is complete, begin a whirlpool in the kettle and let the knockout hops rest in the hot wort for at least 30 minutes before chilling.

Chill the wort rapidly to 68 °F (20 °C). Ferment at 68 °F (20 °C) for one week. Cool to 55 °F (13 °C) to settle yeast from beer. Dump the yeast or rack the beer to a clean, sanitized vessel. Add the dry hops and let the beer sit on the dry hops for an additional four to seven days at 55–57 °F (13–14 °C). Your beer is now ready to rack into a keg, or into bottles with priming sugar.

Tips for Success:
When toasting flaked grains at home the key is getting the flaked grains to a point where your entire kitchen is smelling of wonderfully toasted bread. It will add a layer of complexity to the final beer, which is a fundamental part of this impeccably-brewed black IPA. Experimenting with toasting the flaked grains is probably a good idea to get this process down pat before brew day. Do this by trying out different toasting levels and tasting them in small test batches to find the color and corresponding flavor that tastes best. If you find that your flaked grains make your mash a little gummy, try adding a handful of rice hulls to break things up a bit.

Also make sure to use Carafa® Special, or similarly de-husked malted barley, as this is the de-husked version of Weyermann’s Carafa® malt. Using de-husked malts reduces astringency in the beer, which is common when brewing with highly-roasted grains. This is a key to producing the dark color of the beer without also getting the bite found in other darker beers.

Don’t skimp on the hops when brewing a black IPA. A common mantra is to hop a black IPA like it were an imperial IPA. This will allow the hop characteristics to shine above the roasted aspects of this beer style.

Step by Step
In your brewpot, heat 3.5 quarts (3.3 L) of water to 163 °F (73 °C). Add crushed grains to a nylon steeping bag and steep for 45 minutes at 152 °F (67 °C). While grains are steeping, heat 1.5 quarts (1.4 L) of rinse (sparge) water to 170 °F (77 °C). After steep, put a colander over your brewpot and put the grain bag in it. Rinse grains with 170 °F (77 °C) sparge water. Add water to brewpot to make 4.0 gallons (15 L). (If you boil a smaller volume, you will not be able to extract the proper amount of bitterness from the hops.)

Bring "grain tea" and water to a boil and add dried malt extract. Boil for 60 minutes, adding hops at times indicated in the ingredient list. Keep a smaller pot of boiling water handy, and keep the boil volume topped up to 4.0 gallons (15 L). Stir in the liquid malt extract at the end of the boil and let it steep for 15 minutes before cooling. Cool wort and transfer to fermenter. Top up to 5 gallons (19 L) with cool water and aerate thoroughly. Pitch yeast and follow fermentation instructions in all-grain recipe.

Step by Step
Mill the grains and dough-in targeting a mash of around 1.5 quarts of water to 1 pound of grain (a liquor-to-grist ratio of about 3:1 by weight) and a temperature of 152 °F (67 °C). Hold the mash at 152 °F (67 °C) until enzymatic conversion is complete. Infuse the mash with near-boiling water while stirring or with a recirculating mash system raise the temperature to mash out at 168 °F (76 °C). Sparge slowly with 170 °F (77 °C) water, collecting wort until the pre-boil kettle volume is around 5.9 gallons (22.3 L) and the gravity is 1.048 (11.8 °P).

Once the wort is boiling, add the bittering hops. The total wort boil time is 1 hour after adding the bittering hops. During that time add the Irish moss or other kettle finings with 15 minutes left in the boil and add the last two hop additions at 10 minutes remaining and at flame out. Chill the wort to 67 °F (19 °C) and aerate thoroughly. The proper pitch rate is 10 grams of properly rehydrated dry yeast, 2 packages of liquid yeast, or 1 package of liquid yeast in a 2-liter starter.

Ferment around 67 °F (19 °C) until the yeast drops clear. With healthy yeast, fermentation should be complete in a week or less. Allow the lees to settle and the brew to mature without pressure for another two days after fermentation appears finished. Rack to a keg and force carbonate or rack to a bottling bucket, add priming sugar, and bottle.

Step by Step
If you can’t get fresh liquid malt extract, it is better to use an appropriate amount of dry malt extract (DME) instead.

Mill or coarsely crack the specialty malt and place loosely in a grain bag. Avoid packing the grains too tightly in the bag, using more bags if needed. Steep the bag in about 1 gallon (~4 liters) of water at roughly 160 °F (71 °C) for about 30 minutes. Lift the grain bag out of the steeping liquid and rinse with warm water. Allow the bags to drip into the kettle for a few minutes while you add the malt extract. Do not squeeze the bags. Add enough water to the steeping liquor and malt extract to make a pre-boil volume of 5.9 gallons (22.3 liters) and a gravity of 1.0485 (11.8 °P). Stir thoroughly to help dissolve the extract and bring to a boil.

Once the wort is boiling, add the bittering hops. The total wort boil time is 1 hour after adding the bittering hops. During that time add the Irish moss or other kettle finings with 15 minutes left in the boil and add the last two hop additions at 10 minutes remaining and at flame out. Chill the wort to 67 °F (19 °C) and aerate thoroughly. The proper pitch rate is 10 grams of properly rehydrated dry yeast, 2 packages of liquid yeast, or 1 package of liquid yeast in a 2 liter starter. Follow the fermentation and packaging instructions for the all-grain version.

Tips For Success:
Generally speaking, the darker the malt the less you will want to use in an American pale. Focus your specialty malt usage more on the bready malt notes and make sure that the malt character does not start to overwhelm the easy drinking and hoppy balance that is American pale ale.

I really like using citrusy or piney American variety hops such as Cascade, Centennial, Columbus, Simcoe®, and Amarillo® for flavor and aroma, but there are plenty of great examples out there that use a wide variety of hops from around the world. You can use almost any hop you feel has a pleasant character. It is the overall impression that matters.

Left Hand Brewing Co.’s Oktoberfest clone
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.061 FG = 1.010
IBU = 25 SRM = 9 ABV = 6.6%

Ingredients
7.25 lbs. (3.3 kg) Munich malt (10 °L)
5.7 lbs. (2.6 kg) Pilsner malt
4.5 AAU Apollo hops (60 min.) (0.25 oz./7.1 g at 18% alpha acids)
2.5 AAU Mt. Hood hops (25 min.) (0.5 oz./14.2 g at 5% alpha acids)
1.75 AAU Mt. Hood hops (5 min.) (0.35 oz./9.9 g at 5% alpha acids)
1 Whirlfloc tablet (25 min.)
Wyeast 2352 (Munich Lager II), White Labs WLP860 (Munich Helles Lager), or SafLager S-189 yeast
¾ cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Mill the grains, then mix with 5 gallons (19 L) of approximately 131 °F (55 °C) water to achieve a 122 °F (50 °C) mash temperature. Let the mash rest for 10 minutes. During the mash rest, check the pH. The target is 5.4 pH; add lactic acid to achieve the target. Once the pH is within range, raise the temperature of the mash to 147 °F (64 °C) and hold for 30 minutes. Next, raise the temperature of the mash to 154 °F (68 °C) and hold for 30 minutes. Transfer 40% of the mash to a separate vessel and bring to a boil. Boil for 15 minutes. The aroma will be marvelous. Transfer boiled mash back to lauter tun.

Vorlauf for 15 minutes or until wort is clear. Run off the wort to the kettle, then begin to sparge once you have 1–2 gallons (3.8–7.6 L) wort in the kettle. Due to the decoction, keep the mash bed fairly wet to avoid a stuck bed. Sparge four gallons (15.1 L) of water at 172 °F (78 °C). Lauter until you have 6.5 gallons (24.6 L) of wort.

Heat wort to a rolling boil, start a 60-minute boil timer and add first hop addition of Apollo hops. Add the second hop addition and Whirlfloc with 25 minutes left in the boil. Add the final hop addition of Mt. Hood with 5 minutes left. Once the boil is complete, whirlpool the wort and let rest for 15 minutes.

Chill the wort to 50 °F (10 °C). Add a healthy yeast pitch to the fermenter and aerate with pure oxygen (unless using dry yeast strain). Ferment at 52 °F (11 °C) until the beer is below 1.030, then increase temperature slightly to 57 °F (14 °C) for a diacetyl rest. Leave at that temperature until beer has been terminal and stable for three days. Drop temperature to 32 °F (0 °C), dump the yeast after 10 days and lager for at least 30 more days. Bottle or keg and carbonate to 2.6 v/v.

Left Hand Brewing Co.’s Oktoberfest clone
(5 gallons/19 L, extract only)
OG = 1.061 FG = 1.010
IBU = 25 SRM = 9 ABV = 6.6%

Ingredients
3.8 lbs. (1.7 kg) Munich dried malt extract
3 lbs. (1.36 kg) Pilsen light dried malt extract
4.5 AAU Apollo hops (60 min.) (0.25 oz./7.1 g at 18% alpha acids)
2.5 AAU Mt. Hood hops (25 min.) (0.5 oz./14.2 g at 5% alpha acids)
1.75 AAU Mt. Hood hops (5 min.) (0.35 oz./9.9 g at 5% alpha acids)
1 Whirlfloc tablet (25 min.)
Wyeast 2352 (Munich Lager II), White Labs WLP860 (Munich Helles Lager), or SafLager S-189 yeast
¾ cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Heat 3 gallons (11.4 L) of water in your kettle. Bring to, or at least near, a boil. Remove from heat and stir in the malt extract slowly to avoid clumping. Once all extract is in and dissolved, return to boil (for 60 minutes) and add the first hop addition.

Add the second hop addition and Whirlfloc with 25 minutes left in the boil. Add the final hop addition of Mt. Hood with 5 minutes left. Once the boil is complete, whirlpool the wort and let rest for 15 minutes.

Chill the wort to 50 °F (10 °C). Top your fermenter with pre-boiled and chilled water also at 50 °F (10 °C) to yield a total of 5 gallons (19 L).

Add a healthy yeast pitch to the fermenter and aerate with pure oxygen (unless using dry yeast strain). Ferment at 52 °F (11 °C) until the beer is below 1.030, then increase temperature slightly to 57 °F (14 °C) for a diacetyl rest. Leave at that temperature until beer has been terminal and stable for three days. Drop temperature to 32 °F (0 °C), dump the yeast after 10 days and lager for at least 30 more days. Bottle or keg and carbonate to 2.6 v/v.

TIPS FOR SUCCESS:
The all-grain version will provide a more "true-to-the-original" representation of the beer because, according to Head Brewer Adam Lawrence, "The decoction is everything in this beer." But those who are not yet ready to take on all-grain or decoctions will find the extract recipe results in a suitable and tasty beer.

The key to produce a clean lager is to have an ample and healthy yeast pitch and to oxygenate thoroughly if using a liquid yeast strain. It’s better to pitch a little extra yeast than not enough, so it’s strongly recommended to do a large starter and decant after yeast settles or pitch more than one sachet of dry yeast, especially since this is a fairly strong Märzen at 6.6% ABV.

(5 gallons/19 L, extract with grains)
OG = 1.049 FG = 1.012
IBU = 9 SRM = 4ABV = 4.8%

This recipe is our play on the traditional Gose and is a big hit with our customers every time it comes out in the summer. Kettle souring, or fermenting with Lacto, can be difficult for many homebrewers, so we rely on a bunch of acidulated malt to create a mildly tart and refreshing beer that anyone can make. The additional adjuncts not only make this a fun recipe for people to brew, it delivers a light, but complex citrus flavor with a noticeable but not overpowering coriander and salt character that pairs well with food and summertime. The small ABV allows the fans of this beer style to make a day of sitting on the patio, relaxing with friends, and enjoying the sun.

Ingredients

2 lbs. (0.9 kg) acidulated malt
3 lbs. (1.35 kg) wheat dried malt extract
3 lbs. (1.35 kg) Pilsen light liquid malt extract
2.8 AAU Czech Saaz Hops (60 min.) (1 oz./28 g at 2.8% alpha acids)
1 oz. (28 g) lime peel (15 min.)
1 oz. (28 g) lemon peel (15 min.)
1 oz. (28 g) coriander (cracked) (15 min.)
1 oz. (28 g) sea salt (15 min.)
Wyeast 1007 (German Ale) or Imperial Yeast G03 (Dieter) or Safale K-97 yeast.
5⁄8 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by step

Steep crushed grain at 145–155 °F (63–68 °C) in 1–2 gallons (4–8 L) of water for at least 30 minutes. Remove grains and let drain into kettle. Add 2–4 additional gallons (8–15 L) of water (depending on how much your kettle can hold) and bring to a boil. Remove pot from burner and stir in the liquid and dried malt extracts, being careful not to scorch the bottom of the pot. Return kettle to the burner and bring to a boil. Add hops and boil 60 minutes. With 15 minutes remaining in the boil, add lime peel, lemon peel, cracked coriander, and sea salt.

When the boil is complete, quickly cool wort to below 80 °F (27 °C) and transfer to fermenter. Top fermenter up to 5.25 gallons (20 L) if necessary. Aerate and then pitch yeast. Ferment according to the yeast you choose. After fermentation is complete (after approximately two weeks), bottle or keg as normal.

Not all lambics are made with fruit, of course — if you sweeten the finished product with candi sugar, you have faro; if you blend old and new lambics, you have gueuze (pronounced "geuz" with a hard "g"). All are based on a wheat beer that has been allowed to ferment more or less spontaneously, with naturally occurring local yeasts. Like Champagne, lambic is a geographic designation: Beers made in this style outside of the Senne valley should not be called lambics.

Ingredients
3 lbs. (1.36 kg) Pilsner malt
2 lbs. (0.91 kg) malted wheat
1.5 lb. (0.68 kg) flaked wheat
2 lbs. (0.91 kg) extra light dried malt extract
4 AAU well-aged aroma hops: such as Saaz, East Kent Goldings or Tettnang (60 min.) (1 oz./28 g at 4% alpha acid)
Belgian ale yeast (White Labs WLP550 or Wyeast 1762)
Lambic bacteria culture (recultured yeast from commercial lambic, Wyeast 3278 or both)
6 to 9 lbs. (2.7 to 4.1 kg) cherries, raspberries, peaches or other fruit (frozen until ready to use)
1 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Heat 9 quarts (8.5 L) water to 163 °F (73 °C). Crush whole grains and add, with flaked wheat, to liquor. Hold mash at 152 °F (67 °C) for 75 minutes. Runoff and sparge with 12 quarts (11.4 L) water at 170 °F (77 °C). Add malt extract, stir well, bring to a boil. Add hops, boil 60 minutes. Remove from heat. Add to fermenter along with enough water to make up 5.25 gallons (20 L).

Cool to 70 °F (21 °C), pitch ale yeast. Ferment at 68 °F (20 °C) for two weeks, rack onto fruit in your secondary and add lambic culture. Condition cool (50 °F/10 °C)) for three to four weeks. Rack into third vessel to clarify at 50 °F (10 °C) for two weeks. Keg and force carbonate or prime with corn sugar, bottle and age at least three to four weeks at 45 to 50 °F (8 to 10 °C). Serve at 40 °F (4 °C) in either a heavy glass tumbler or a champagne-style flute.

All-grain option:
Replace the dried malt extract with another 1.75 lbs. (0.8 kg) each Pilsner and wheat malt. Increase mash water to 15 quarts (14.2 L) and sparge water to 20 quarts (19 L). Mash time and temperatures will be the same. Proceed as above from boiling.

OG = 1.030 FG = 1.004
IBU = 15 SRM = 10–15 ABV = 3.5%

Ingredients
1.8 lbs. (0.82 kg) 6-row malted barley
1.8 lbs. (0.82 kg) wheat bran
1.7 lbs. (0.77 kg) light molasses (10 min.)
3.6 AAU Cluster whole-leaf hops (first wort hop) (0.66 oz./19 g at 5.5% alpha acids)
1 star anise, crushed (5 min.)
Lallemand Nottingham, or SafAle S-04, or Wyeast 1098 (British Ale), or White Labs WLP007 (English Dry Ale) yeast
6.85 oz. (195 g) brown sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Boil roughly 1.25 gallons (5 L) of water and dough in the mash tun with the wheat bran. Rest 15–20 minutes then measure the temperature. Add roughly 1.25 gallons (5 L) of room temperature water a little at a time to bring the temperature to around 156 °F (69 °C). This extra water will allow you to break up the bran easier while mixing to thin out the mash and ensure that there are no dough balls.

Add 6-row malted barley to reach a target mash temperature of about 150 °F (66 °C), then rest for 60 minutes. Sparge with 172 °F (78 °C) water (mash tun will rise to 168 °F/76 °C), and lauter to 6.5 gallons (25 L) in the kettle along with the hops.

Total boil time is 90 minutes, adding molasses at 10 minutes until flameout. Stir well to mix the molasses into solution. At 5 minutes until flameout add the crushed star anise. At flameout, whirlpool for 15 minutes, then knock to
65 °F (18 °C). Transfer to the fermenter, pitch yeast, and ferment at that temperature. No aeration is needed or a yeast starter if using a liquid yeast strain.

Once fermentation is complete, transfer the beer over to a bottling bucket or keg for packaging.

Bottle or keg condition to 2.8 volumes of CO2 using brown sugar. You must accurately measure the volume of beer needing to be primed to hit your target. Dose the brown sugar at a rate of 1.37 oz. per gallon (10.26 g/L) and let rest at room or ambient temperature for about three days to condition.

Liquid Pumpkin Pie
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.054 FG = 1.014
IBU = 15 SRM = 13 ABV = 5.4%

Ingredients
4 lbs. (1.8 kg) UK Golden Promise™ malt
2 lbs. (0.91 kg) German Vienna malt
1.5 lbs. (0.68 kg) German dark Munich malt
12 oz. (0.34 kg) flaked oats
12 oz. (0.34 kg) flaked wheat
12 oz. (0.34 kg) Belgian Caravienne® malt
6 oz. (170 g) UK brown malt
2 oz. (57 g) UK chocolate malt
4.1 AAU UK Goldings hops (60 min.) (0.7 oz./20 g at 5.9% alpha acids)
8 oz. (0.23 kg) natural brown sugar (15 min.)
3 oz. (85 g) light molasses (15 min.)
9 lbs. (4.1 kg) canned pumpkin puree (plain, unspiced)
6 cinnamon sticks, broken up (0 min.)
1.5 Tbsp. crystalized ginger, chopped (0 min.)
1 whole nutmeg, chopped (0 min.)
10 dried allspice berries, crushed (0 min.)
0.25 tsp. ground mace (0 min.)
4 green cardamom pods, split, husks discarded, seeds crushed (0 min.)
Wyeast 1272 (American Ale II) or White Labs WLP051 (California Ale IV) yeast
3⁄4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Make a 1-qt. (1-L) yeast starter 2–3 days before brew day.

Prepare the pumpkin (can be done the night before). Spread puree into a large baking dish. Roast at 400 °F (204 °C) for about an hour, stirring every 15 minutes, until fairly dry and caramelized but not burned. Put in a fine mesh bag. If prepared the night before, allow to cool, cover, and refrigerate until brew day. Remove from refrigerator and bring to room temperature before using.

Prepare spices and place them in a fine mesh bag. I use reverse osmosis (RO) water. Add 1⁄4 tsp. 10% phosphoric acid per 5 gallons (19 L) of brewing water, or until water measures pH 5.5 at room temperature. Add 1 tsp. calcium chloride (CaCl2) to the mash. On brew day, mash in the first five malts and grains at 131 °F (55 °C) in 15 qts.
(14 L) of water, and hold this tem-perature for 15 minutes. Raise the temperature by infusion or direct heating to 149 °F (65 °C) for 30 minutes. Raise the temperature to 158 °F (70 °C) for 30 minutes. Finally, raise to 168 °F (76 °C) to mashout. Add the pumpkin in the mesh bag, and the Caravienne®, brown and chocolate malts, and recirculate for 15 minutes, recirculating over the top and through the mesh bag. Fly sparge with 168 °F (76 °C) water until 6.5 gallons (25 L) of wort is collected. After the wort has been collected, add the mesh bag of pumpkin to the kettle. Remove the bag when the wort has come to a boil, allowing liquid to drip back into the kettle.

Boil the wort for 90 minutes, adding the hops, sugar, and molasses at times indicated. After the heat is turned off, add the spices and let steep for 10 minutes. Remove the spices and let the wort stand for an additional 10 minutes before chilling to 66 °F (19 °C).

Oxygenate, then pitch the yeast starter. Allow fermentation temperature to rise to no more than 70 °F (21 °C) until fermentation is complete. Rack and allow the beer to drop bright, using crash cooling or fining if necessary. Adjust spices to taste, if desired. Prime and bottle condition, or keg and force carbonate to 2 to 2.5 volumes.

IBU = 55 SRM = 8 ABV = 6.9%

Ingredients
6.3 lbs. (2.9 kg) triticale malt
6.3 lbs. (2.9 kg) 2-row pale malt
1.4 lbs. (0.64 kg) Gambrinus honey malt
8 oz. (227 g) rice hulls
11 AAU Idaho Seven hops (60 min.) (1 oz./28 g at 11% alpha acids)
1 oz. (28 g) Idaho Seven hops (5 min.)
1 oz. (28 g) Idaho Seven hops (0 min.)
2 oz. (57 g) Idaho Seven hops (dry hop)
Wyeast 1056 (American Ale) or White Labs WLP001 (California Ale) or Safale US-05 yeast
2⁄3 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Heat 4.5 gallons (17 L) of water, treated to imitate the waters of London, so the mash temperature lands in the 148–154 °F (64–67 °C) range. Add enough of this water to the mash tun to cover the false bottom and mix with 4 oz. (113 g) of the rice hulls. Let soak for a few minutes. Add the grist, remaining water and rice hulls, stirring to combine and break up any dough balls. Maintain 148–154 °F (64–67 °C) for 50 minutes. Add 1 gallon of 190 °F (88 °C) to the mash tun to mash out for 10 minutes. Vorlauf until the wort runs clear, then sparge with 170 °F (77 °C) water and collect 6 gallons (23 L) into the kettle.

Boil for 60 minutes, adding hops at times indicated in the ingredient list and adding 1 tab of Whirlfloc at 10 minutes remaining.

Quickly cool to 68 °F (20 °C), aerate the wort, and pitch yeast. After 6 or 7 days, when airlock activity slows to less than one bubble every 60 seconds and primary fermentation appears complete, transfer the beer off of the trub and into a secondary fermenter and add dry hop addition for 10 days.
Bottle and add priming sugar or keg and force carbonate to 2.3 volumes.

Wyeast 1187 (Ringwood Ale) or White Labs WLP005 (British Ale) or Safale S-04 yeast
¾ cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Mill the grains, then mix with 3.4 gallons (12.8 L) of 166 °F (74 °C) strike water to achieve a single infusion rest temperature of 151 °F (66 °C). Hold at this temperature for 60 min. Mashout to 170 °F (77 °C).

Vorlauf until your runnings are clear before directing runnings to your boil kettle. Batch or fly sparge the mash to obtain 6.5 gallons (25 L) of wort. Boil for 60 minutes, adding hops at the indicated times left in the boil. At 15 minutes left in boil, add either Irish moss, Whirlfloc, other kettle fining agent of your choice to the wort.

After the boil, whirlpool for a couple of minutes and allow the wort to settle before rapidly chilling the wort to slightly below fermentation temperature, which is 66 °F (19 °C) for this beer. Pitch yeast.

Maintain fermentation temperature to avoid too many esters, which can easily occur with this strain. You may need a diacetyl rest for this strain so don’t hesitate to raise the temperature of the fermentation at least 4 °F (2 °C) during the last third of fermentation. Bottle or keg the beer and carbonate to approximately 2.6 volumes.

¾ cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Bring 6.5 gallons (25 L) of water to roughly 150 °F (66 °C). Steep the chocolate and crystal malts for 15 minutes before removing. Add the DME and maltodextrin, with stirring, before heating to a boil. Boil for 60 minutes, adding hops at the indicated times left in the boil. At 15 minutes left in boil, add either Irish moss, Whirlfloc, other kettle fining agent of your choice to the wort.

After the boil, whirlpool for a couple of minutes before rapidly chilling the wort to slightly below fermentation temperature, which is 66 °F (19 °C) for this beer. Pitch yeast.

Maintain fermentation temperature to avoid producing excess esters. You may need a diacetyl rest for this strain so don’t hesitate to raise the temperature of the fermentation at least 4 °F (2 °C) during the last third of fermentation. Bottle or keg the beer and carbonate to approximately 2.6 volumes.

Tips for Success:
This amber beer is all about balance without sacrificing either the depth of flavor or drinkability. For the ingredients to really shine, ensure that you’re using the freshest versions of them possible. In addition, aim for gypsum and calcium chloride water additions to hit 247 ppm and 100 ppm, respectively. As is the case with most British ale yeasts, you’ll probably pick up a bit of diacetyl, so don’t be afraid to perform a diacetyl rest. When in doubt, microwave a beer sample for 30 seconds, which will volatilize any aromatics including 2,3-butanedione.

IBU = 31 SRM = 3 ABV = 5.3%

Winner of the 10th Annual Virginia Beer Blitz (Hampton, Virginia: 383 entries)

Ingredients
9 lbs. 10 oz. (4.4 kg) floor-malted Pilsner malt
3 oz. (85 g) acidulated malt
7.2 AAU Magnum hops (60 min.) (0.6 oz./17 g at 12% alpha acid)
1.5 AAU Hallertauer hops (15 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 3% alpha acids)
0.5 oz. (14 g) Hallertauer hops (0 min.)
Saflager W-34/70 or White Labs WLP830 (German Lager) or Wyeast 2124 (Bohemian Lager) yeast
3⁄4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
If you opt to use the liquid yeast strains, two or three days before brew day, make an appropriate-sized yeast starter, aerating the wort thoroughly (preferably with oxygen) before pitching the yeast. This can be skipped if you use the dried yeast. Prepare brewing water to the following profile: 75 ppm calcium, 2 ppm magnesium, 17 ppm sodium, 92 ppm sulfate, 78 ppm chloride, 32 ppm bicarbonate.

This recipe uses a step mash. Mash in the malts at 125 °F (52 °C) in 15 qts. (14 L) of prepared water, and hold this temperature for 20 minutes. Raise mash temperature to 145 °F (63 °C) and hold for 40 minutes. Raise mash temperature to 158 °F (70 °C) and hold for 30 minutes. Raise to 168 °F (76 °C) and hold for 10 minutes. Sparge with 168 °F (76 °C) water until 6.5 gallons (25 L) of wort is collected.

Boil the wort for 90 minutes, adding the hops at times indicated in the ingredients list. Chill the wort rapidly to 45 °F (7 °C). Rehydrate the dry yeast, then pitch into oxygenated wort. Ferment at 50 °F (10 °C) for 2 weeks, raise to 60 °F (16 °C) for one week, lower temperature slowly to
34 °F (1 °C) and lager for two weeks. Prime and bottle condition, or keg and force carbonate.

OG = 1.048 FG = 1.008
IBU = 31 SRM = 4 ABV = 5.3%

Ingredients
6.6 lbs. (3 kg) Pilsner liquid malt extract
7.2 AAU Magnum hops (60 min.) (0.6 oz./17 g at 12% alpha acids)
1.5 AAU Hallertauer hops (15 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 3% alpha acids)
0.5 oz. (14 g) Hallertauer hops (0 min.)
Saflager W-34/70 or White Labs WLP830 (German Lager) or Wyeast 2124 (Bohemian Lager) yeast
3⁄4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Use 6 gallons (23 L) of water in the brew kettle; heat to 158 °F (70 °C). Turn off heat. Add the liquid malt extract and stir thoroughly to dissolve the extract completely. You do not want to feel liquid extract at the bottom of the kettle when stirring with your spoon. Turn the heat back on and bring to a boil. Boil the wort for 60 minutes, adding the hops at the times indicated in the ingredients list. Chill the wort rapidly to 45 °F (7 °C).

Rehydrate the dry yeast, then pitch into oxygenated wort. Ferment at 50 °F (10 °C) for 2 weeks, raise to 60 °F (15 °C) for one week, lower temperature slowly to 34 °F (1 °C) and lager for two weeks. Prime and bottle condition, or keg and force carbonate.

Tips for Success:
This beer was the first Pilsner that Brian and his brother Scott had brewed, and it was the first beer in a series of lagers they planned (so they can reuse the yeast in multiple batches). To really nail this technically challenging style, Brian recommends really paying attention to controlling fermentation temperature, oxygenating the wort, practicing better yeast management and pitching, limiting cold side aeration, designing water chemistry, and refining other processes. For more on making a yeast starter, check out byo.com/resources/build-a-yeast-starter.
One of the biggest keys to brewing award-winning lagers is to control your fermentation temperatures. Fermenting above the normal temperature range may produce excessive fruity-flavored esters or harsh-flavored fusel alcohols.

For all-grain brewers, a note on brewing water. You can make a perfectly fine German Pilsner with most water, (within reason). But if you want to make award-winning examples, it pays to pay attention to your brewing water. Brewing very clean lagers requires very low carbonate water, hence the recipe included in the all-grain recipe here. If you aren’t sure what your brewing water profile is, you can request a water report from your municipal water source. Or start with reverse osmosis (RO) water and build the profile provided.

OG = 1.055 (13.6 °P) FG = 1.013 (3.4 °P)
IBU = 26 SRM = 5 ABV = 5.5%

Ingredients
5.5 lb. (2.5 kg) American two-row malt (2 °L)
3.75 lb. (1.7 kg) rye malt (4 °L)
3 lb. (1.4 kg) wheat malt (2 °L)
3.25 AAU Simcoe® pellet hops (60 min.) (0.25 oz./7 g of 13% alpha acids)
3.5 AAU Amarillo® pellet hops (15 min.) (0.35 oz./10 g of 10% alpha acids)
4.55 AAU Simcoe® pellet hops (15 min.) (0.35 oz./10 g of 13% alpha acids)
5 AAU Amarillo® pellet hops (0 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g of 10% alpha acids)
White Labs WLP320 (American Hefeweizen), Wyeast 1010 (American Wheat) or Fermentis Safale US-05 yeast

Step by Step
Mill the grains and dough-in targeting a mash of around 1.5 quarts of water to 1 pound of grain (a liquor-to-grist ratio of about 3:1 by weight) and a temperature of 152 °F (67 °C). Hold the mash at 152 °F (67 °C) until enzymatic conversion is complete. Infuse the mash with near boiling water while stirring or with a recirculating mash system raise the temperature to mash out at 168 °F (76 °C). Sparge slowly with 170 °F (77 °C) water, collecting wort until the pre-boil kettle volume is around 5.9 gallons (22.3 L) and the gravity is 1.047 (11.7 °P).

Once the wort is boiling, add the bittering hops. The total wort boil time is one hour after adding the bittering hops. Add Irish moss or other kettle finings and the 15 minute hop additions with 15 minutes left in the boil. Add the last hop addition just before shutting off the burner. Chill the wort rapidly to 65 °F (18 °C), let the break material settle, rack to the fermenter, pitch the yeast and aerate thoroughly.

Use 10 grams of properly rehydrated dry yeast, two liquid yeast packages or make a starter. Ferment at 65 °F (18 °C). Carbonate the beer to approximately 2.5 volumes.

After the break (about 5 min. into boil), add Chinook hops and boil 40 min. Add 1 oz. Mt Hood and boil 15 min. more. Add final Mt Hood addition and boil 5 more minutes. Total boil is about 60 min. Turn off heat and stir to create a whirlpool. Let settle for 10 minutes. Chill to yeast pitching temperature, about 68 °F (20 °C). Transfer to primary and top off to 5 gal (19 L) if needed. Ferment at 68 to 70 °F (20 to 21 °C). Ferment for seven to fourteen days. Bottle or keg as usual.

OG = 1.016 FG = 1.013
IBU = 19 SRM = 2 ABV = 0.5%

Ingredients
3 lbs. (1.36 kg) German Pilsner malt
3.2 oz. (91 g) wheat malt
3.2 oz. (91 g) Carapils® malt
4.5 AAU Hallertau Mittelfrüh hops (60 min.) (1 oz./28 g at 4.5% alpha acids)
4.5 AAU Hallertau Mittelfrüh hops (10 min.) (1 oz./28 g at 4.5% alpha acids)
White Labs WLP306 (Torulaspora delbrueckii) or SafAle LA-01

Step by step
Strike in with a very thin mash, roughly 2 qts./lb. (4.2 L/kg). This is a single infusion mash performed for 60 minutes at 162 °F (72 °C). Begin lautering by raising to mash out at 170 °F (77 °C). An infusion of boiling water is recommended for rapid termination of enzymatic activity. Sparge with enough water so that you are not exceeding 1.5x the amount of initial strike water used between the boiling infusion and sparge water. Top up your kettle to 6 gallons (23 L) with water. Bring wort to a boil. Total boil time is 60 minutes. Add the first hops just after boil is achieved. Add the second hop addition with 10 minutes remaining in the boil.

Chill the wort down to 50 °F (10 °C) and pitch the yeast. Hold at this temperature for one week then check the gravity. If gravity is stable, move the beer to a lager vessel and reduce the temperature to 34 °F (1 °C). Hold at this temperature for two weeks. Keg and force carbonate to 2.8 v/v.

(5 gallon/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.039 FG =1.005
IBU = 20 SRM = 4 ABV = 4.5%

This is out attempt to brew a beer full of flavor but low in calories

Ingredients
7.4 lbs. (3.4 kg) pale malt
1.25 lbs. (0.57 kg) rye malt
6.75 AAU Columbus hops (15 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 13.5% alpha acids)
1 oz. (28 g) Kohatu hops (0 min.)
4 oz. (113 g) Nelson Sauvin hops (dry hop)
1 oz. (28 g) grains of paradise (15 min.)
1⁄2 tsp. Glucoamylase (AMG) in fermenter
Omega West Coast Ale I (OYL-004) or SafAle US-05 yeast
3⁄4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by step
Focusing on mash schedule and exogenous enzymes, I endeavored to make a flavorful all-grain beer with an ABV above 4% but that comes in at about 120 calories per 12-ounce (355-mL) serving. As we discussed previously, mash schedule is important in reducing the unfermentable dextrins that add unwanted calories. In my converted cooler mash tun I know I consistently lose 8 °F (4 °C) when I mash in, so to target the 149 °F (65 °C) we mentioned before I mash in at 157 °F (69 °C). It is incredibly useful to have this kind of understanding of your equipment. You can come to learn the ins and outs of your setup over time or you can spend the time to do several trials to fine tune it. After mashing in I let that temperature coast downward. In fact, because I wanted to move the temperature into beta amylase range for this beer, I left the lid off of the mash tun for the first 30 minutes and stirred it three or four times. In those 30 minutes the temperature dropped to 145 °F (63 °C) and I put the lid on, losing just 1 °F (2 °C) over the final 30 minutes of the mash. These steps helped make sure I maximized the fermentable potential in my conversion and minimized dextrin production.

The boil for this beer is very straightforward. Sixty-minute boil, adding spices and hops with 15 minutes remaining in the boil and hops again at flame out. The grains of paradise are a spice I love in lighter beers. It is related to cardamom and comes from West Africa. Grains of paradise bring a sweet and spicy flavor but also have a botanical component. I always get a subtle lavender and juniper when I use this spice.

After cooling to my yeast-pitching temperature and inoculating with yeast, I added glucoamylase. Earlier we mentioned "exogenous enzymes," these being ones that you are adding to your process as opposed to "endogenous," which would be the naturally occurring enzymes in your base malts. Glucoamylase will continue to break down any of the remaining dextrin chains into fermentable glucose molecules.

With the mash schedule, and the use of the glucoamylase in the fermenter, I have been able to push the final gravity as low as 1.002 but over my trails with this process I average 1.005. The beer is light with a spicy bite on the tongue and subtle botanical aromas in the nose. With a starting gravity of 1.039 and a final gravity of 1.005 this recipe comes in at around 4.5% ABV and 125 calories, just missing my goal of 120 calories. If desired, I could push the final gravity down a little by swapping some of the grain out and replacing it with 100% fermentable sugar.

Partial mash option: Swap out 6 lbs. (2.7 kg) of the pale malt for 3 lbs. (1.4 kg) of extra light dried malt extract. Mash the crushed grains in a muslin bag in 1 gallon (3. 8L ) water. In a similar fashion as the all-grain version, mash for 60 minutes starting at 149 °F (65 °C) and allowing the temperature to drop to about 145 °F (63 °C) during the first 30 minutes, then maintain that temperature for the duration. Remove the bag and wash grains with 1 gallon (4 L) of hot water. Top up the kettle and add dried malt extract and bring to a boil. Follow the all-grain instructions for boil, fermentation, and packaging.

Lupulin Brewing Co.’s Sophistry 06 clone
Lupulin Brewing Co.’s Sophistry 06 clone
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.072 FG = 1.015
IBU = 27* SRM = 5 ABV = 7.5%

* Beers heavily dry hopped can differ greatly from the calculated IBU levels that a beer calculator may provide. While our calculator says that this beer will contain 27 IBUs, when measured on a spectrophotometer, this beer actually reads around 50–60 IBUs.

"Our Sophistry series of IPAs is our way of playing around with new hops, techniques, and combinations to find fun new flavors," said Matt Schiller, Co-Founder and Head of Brewing Operations at Lupulin Brewing, in Big Lake, Minnesota. For the sixth Sophistry release, Lupulin focused on brand new hops Lotus™, Altus™, and Sultana™, in combination with Citra®, Lemondrop™, and Sabro™. "We were looking for a nice citrus/tropical effect with a kiss of vanilla and we got it."

Ingredients
5.4 lbs. (2.9 kg) 2-row pale malt
4.2 lbs. (1.9 kg) Golden Promise pale ale malt
1.6 lbs. (0.73 kg) flaked wheat
1.6 lbs. (0.73 kg) flaked oats
0.8 lb. (0.36 kg) maltodextrin
0.45 oz. (13 g) lemon peel (5 min.)
9 AAU Citra® hops (30 min.) (0.75 oz./21 g at 12% alpha acids)
30 AAU Lotus™ hops (hop stand) (1.9 oz./54 g at 16% alpha acids)
30 AAU Altus™ hops (hop stand) (1.9 oz./54 g at 16% alpha acids)
14 AAU Sultana™ hops (hop stand) (1 oz./28 g at 14% alpha acids)
25 AAU Citra® Cryo hops (hop stand) (1 oz./28 g at 25% alpha acids)
3.2 oz. (90 g) Citra® hops (dry hop)
1.9 oz. (54 g) Lemondrop™ hops (dry hop)
3.2 oz. (90 g) Sabro™ hops (dry hop)
Omega OYL-11 (British Ale V), or Wyeast 1318 (London Ale III), or LalBrew Verdant IPA yeast
2⁄3 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
This is a single infusion mash. Begin by heating 20.5 qts. (19.5 L), this is 1.5 qts. strike water per pound of grain (3 L/kg), up to 164 °F (73 °C). Mix with grains to achieve a stable mash temperature at 150 °F (66 °C). After 60 minutes begin recirculation. Sparge with enough water to collect 6.5 gallons (24.6 L) of wort in your kettle. Boil wort for 60 minutes, adding the first addition of hops with 30 minutes remaining. With 5 minutes remaining in the boil add the lemon peel, maltodextrin, and a kettle fining agent such as Whirlfloc or Irish moss if desired.

After the boil is complete, cool down to 170 °F (77 °C) and then add the hop stand additions, stir the kettle to create a vigorous whirlpool, cover, and let stand for 15 minutes before cooling to yeast-pitching temperature.

Pitch yeast and begin fermentation at 66 °F (19 °C) and ramp to 72 °F (21 °C) throughout fermentation. After active fermentation is complete, add the dry hops for three days then transfer off the hops. Cold crash the beer to near freezing, but only if you have a vessel in which positive CO2 pressure can be placed on the beer. You don’t want any suckback of oxygen into your vessel. After two days, the beer is ready. You may want to transfer your beer to a serving keg if dispensing on draft. Bottle and prime or force carbonate to 2.4 volumes CO2.

IBU = 25 SRM = 31 ABV = 3.8%

Ingredients
3.5 lbs. (1.6 kg) Muntons light dried malt extract
12 oz. (0.34 kg) 2-row pale ale malt
8.0 oz. (0.23 kg) crystal malt (90 °L)
3.0 oz. (85 g) chocolate malt
3.0 oz. (85 g) roasted barley (300 °L)
5.0 oz. (142 g) roasted barley (500 °L)
1.0 oz. (28 g) black patent malt
0.50 lbs. (0.23 kg) lactose (15 min.)
0.25 cup Splenda (optional, at bottling/kegging)
1 tsp. Irish moss
7.5 AAU Magnum hops (60 min.) (0.47 oz./13 g of 16% alpha acids)
Wyeast 1968 (London ESB Ale), White Labs WLP002 (English ale) or Nottingham dried yeast (1 qt./~1 L yeast starter)
2/3 cup corn sugar (for priming)

Step by Step
Place crushed grains in a nylon steeping bag. In a large kitchen pot, heat 3.0 qts. (2.8 L) of water to 163 °F (73 °C). Submerge grain bag in water and let steep at 152 °F (67 °C) for 45 minutes. (If temperature drops below 148 °F (64 °C), heat to 152 °F (67 °C) again.) While grains are steeping, heat 1.5 qts. (~1.5 L) of water to 170 °F (77 °C) in a sauce pan. Also, begin heating 2 gallons (7.6 L) of water to a boil in your brewpot. When steeping is done, place a colander over your brewpot and lift the grain bag into it. Pour the "grain tea" through the bag (which will strain out most of the grain bits), then rinse the bag with the 1.5 qts. (~1.5 L) of 170 °F (77 °C) water.

Heat the (roughly) 3 gallons (11 L) of wort in your brewpot to a boil, then stir in dried malt extract. (It will foam a bit, so don’t pour all the extract in at once.) Bring the wort back to a boil, add the hops and boil for 60 minutes. Add Irish moss and lactose with 15 minutes left in boil.

After the boil, put a lid on your brewpot and cool the wort (either in a cold-water bath in your sink or with a wort chiller). Cool until the side of the brewpot no longer feels warm. Transfer wort to your fermenter and top up to 5 gallons (19 L) with cool water. Aerate the wort and pitch your yeast. Ferment at 70 °F (21 °F). When fermentation slows to halt, rack to secondary. Bottle with corn sugar (or keg) a few days later. (You may want to add a bit a Splenda — an (unfermentable) artificial sugar — if you want the beer to be a little sweeter. Taste an untreated sample in your botting bucket or keg before deciding.)

1 tsp Irish moss (15 min.)
White Labs WLP005 (British Ale) or Wyeast 1098 (British Ale) yeast
0.75 cup of corn sugar for priming

Step by Step
Steep the crushed malts in three gallons of water at 150 ºF (66 ºC) for 30 minutes. Remove the grains from the wort. Add the malt syrup and malt powder and bring to a boil. Add the Centennial (bittering) hops and boil for 60 minutes. Add the aroma hops (Cascade) for the last two minutes of the boil.

When done boiling, strain out hops, add the wort to two gallons of cool water in a sanitary fermenter, and top off with cool
water to 5.5 gallons (21 L). Cool the wort to 80 ºF (27 ºC), aerate the beer and pitch your yeast. Allow the beer to cool over the next few hours to 68–70 ºF (20-21 ºC) and ferment for 10–14 days. Add the 0.5 oz. (14 g) of Cascade pellets to dry-hop your beer for five to seven days, then bottle your beer. Pellet hops work well when dry-hopping this beer.

All-grain option:
Replace the light malt syrup and powder with 10 pounds (4.5 kg) of British pale ale malt and 1.5 pounds (0.68 kg) Munich malt. Mash all your grains at 155 ºF (68 ºC) for 45 minutes. Collect enough wort to boil for 90 minutes and have a 5.5 gallon (21 L) yield. The remainder of the recipe is the same as the extract. Don’t forget to add the dry hops!

Ingredients
5 lbs. 10 oz. (2.6 kg) 2-row pale malt
3 lb. 6 oz. (1.5 kg) white wheat malt
6 oz. (0.17 kg) acidulated malt
2.5 AAU Cascade hops (60 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g of 5% alpha acids)
2.5 AAU Cascade hops (45 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g of 5% alpha acids)

0.5 oz. (14 g) Cascade hops (whirlpool)
0.5 oz. (14 g) Columbus hops (hopback)
Wyeast 1187 (Ringwood Ale) or White Labs WLP005 (British Ale) yeast
3/4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Single infusion mash at 150 °F (66 °C). Boil for 60 minutes. Fermentation temperature is 70 °F (21 °C). "We filter our version of Hocus Pocus bright, but a bit of yeast won’t hurt if filtration isn’t possible. Also, we run our wort through a hopback prior to the wort chiller to achieve maximum hop aroma. We use rice hulls to aid in the lautering process because the large percentage of wheat. This will depend on brewhouse design. Be sure to give the brew a proper diacetyl rest; a large fermentation with Ringwood (150 bbls) needs 24 hours to reduce the buttery character." If you don’t have a hopback or use a whirlpool step, see the extract recipe for an alternate hopping schedule.

Step by Step
Mill the grains and mash in 3.3 gallons (12.5 L) of water at 149 °F (65 °C) for 60 minutes. Vorlauf until your runnings are clear and sparge the grains with enough 168 °F (75 °C) water to obtain a 6-gallon (23 L) pre-boil volume. Once you have collected the full volume, remove enough wort to cover the sea buckthorn berries and begin steeping them separately. Boil the wort for 60 minutes adding the hops at the times indicated in the ingredients list. After the boil, turn off the heat, add the sea buckthorn berries with their steeping liquid and rest for 20 minutes. Chill the wort to about 64 °F (18 °C), transfer it to the fermenter, aerate, and pitch the yeast.

Ferment for two days at 66 °F (19 °C). After two days mash the gooseberries to a pulp and bring them to a boil. Cool the gooseberries to 68 °F (20 °C) and add them to the fermenter at the peak of fermentation. Ferment for an additional seven days then rack to a secondary fermenter for additional clearing if desired. Once fermentation is complete, mix the sea salt into a 1⁄2 cup (0.12 L) of boiling water, cool, add to the beer, and then bottle or keg the beer and carbonate.

Tips for Success:
Salty Kiss is a traditional German Gose. Gose is a top-fermented beer style from the German city of Leipzig, which uses at least 50% wheat in the grist, they are by definition tart, herbal and refreshing but what really characterises them is a defined saltiness which traditonally would have come from the particular water in the area they were brewed. Dried sea buckthorn berries can be purchased online. Sea buckthorn is a unique sour-flavored berry that is considered a "super-food" as it is rich in nutrients and phytochemicals such as vitamin C, carotenoids, vitamin E, amino acids, essential fatty acids, minerals, sterols and flavonols. Sea buckthorn berries can be used to make pies, preserves, fruit wines, and cosmetics, and their inclusion in this recipe along with sea salt will give your beer a very unique flavor twist.

Maine Beer Co.'s iconic New England-style IPA features an intense citrus, grapefruit, tropical fruit, lemon, and pine hop profile.

Ingredients
14 lbs. (6.35 kg) 2-row pale malt
6 oz. (0.17 kg) dextrine malt
3 oz. (85 g) crystal malt (40 °L)
13 oz. (0.37 kg) dextrose sugar (15 min.)
8.3 AAU Falconer’s Flight® hops (30 min.) (0.75 oz./21 g at 11% alpha acids)
9.8 AAU Simcoe® hops (30 min.) (0.75 oz./21 g at 13% alpha acids)
8.3 AAU Citra® hops (5 min.) (0.75 oz./26 g at 11% alpha acids)
8.3 AAU Falconer’s Flight® hops (5 min.) (0.75 oz./21 g at 11% alpha acids)
9 AAU Mosaic™ hops (5 min.) (0.75 oz./21 g at 12% alpha acids)
22 AAU Citra® hops (0 min.) (2 oz./57 g at 11% alpha acids)
2 oz. (57 g) Mosaic™ hops (dry hop)
2 oz. (57 g) Falconer’s Flight® hops (dry hop)
2 oz. (57 g) Simcoe® hops (dry hop)
Wyeast 1056 (American Ale) or White Labs WLP001 (California Ale) or Safale US-05 yeast
3⁄4 cup (150 g) dextrose (if priming)

Step by Step
Mill the grains and mix with 4.8 gallons (18.2 L) of 160 °F (71 °C) strike water to reach a mash temperature of 148 °F (64 °C). Hold this temperature for 60 minutes. Vorlauf until your runnings are clear. Sparge the grains with 3.6 gallons (11.7 L) and top up as necessary to obtain 6.5 gallons (25 L) of wort. Boil for 60 minutes, adding hops according to the ingredient list. After the boil, turn off heat and begin a whirlpool of the hot wort. Let stand for 20 minutes, then chill the wort to slightly below fermentation temperature, about 65 °F (18 °C). There should be 5.5 gallons (21 L) of wort in your kettle. Aerate the wort with pure oxygen or filtered air and pitch yeast. Ferment at 67 °F (19 °C) for 7 days. Add the dry hops and raise to 72 °F (22 °C) for three more days. Once the beer reaches terminal gravity, bottle or keg the beer and carbonate to approximately 2.5 volumes. You may want to cold-crash the beer prior to packaging to 35 °F (2 °C) for 48 hours to improve the clarity.

Extract with grains option:
Substitute the 2-row pale malt and dextrin malt in the all-grain recipe with 9 lbs. (4.1 kg) extra light liquid malt extract. Bring 5.4 gallons (20 L) of water to approximately 162 °F (72 °C) and steep milled specialty grains in grain bags for 15 minutes. Remove the grain bags, and let drain fully. Add liquid extract while stirring, and stir until completely dissolved. Boil for 60 minutes. Follow the remaining portion of the all-grain recipe.

Tips for Success:
Maine Beer Company keeps a tight hold on the "official" recipe for Dinner, which is only brewed in small batches and at not-quite-regular intervals. Their website states that they use 6 lbs. (2.7 kg) of dry hops per barrel of Dinner. That translates to roughly 1 lb. (0.45 kg) of dry hops per 5-gallon (19-L) batch of beer. On a homebrew scale this could be detrimental to your beer. Oxidation and vegetal qualities from the hops being the main causes for concern. Consensus among the BYO staff was that 6 oz. (170 g) would be better on a homebrew scale, but feel free to experiment by adding more. Needless to say, late and dry hopping is essential to Dinner’s success. Maine Beer Co. utilizes a hop-burst type technique for Dinner, so feel free to substitute your favorite hop-burst schedule here. Dry hop only after fermentation has completed. Three days with a free addition of pellets seems sufficient to mirror the hop nose on Dinner, utilize seven days if you are using whole leaf hops.

Making Mozzarella
There are few cheeses as versatile as fresh mozzarella. Sliced up and served with fresh tomatoes and basil, melted on a flatbread pizza, tossed with pasta and olive oil, served on a burger, or even by itself accompanied by your favorite homebrew, fresh mozzarella can make any meal seem a little more seasonal. But if you want to make a dish that is truly homemade, don’t Go to the grocery store and buy a piece of cheese — try putting together your own batch of fresh mozzarella.

Before You Start
A quick search of the Internet or cheesemaking references will result in lots of varying recipes for making fresh mozzarella. This is no cause for concern as there are many recipes and methods for making mozzarella — and most are successful. You can use the recipe in this article, or choose another that suits you. Do not, however, combine recipes or swap out ingredients or measurements. Unlike adding a dash of "this and that" or making substitutions when cooking, cheese recipes are written to replicate certain conditions, and following the directions for a set recipe will give you the best chances for success. If, for some reason, your recipe doesn’t produce the results you want, only then should you go back and tweak the ingredients or try a new recipe.

To make roughly ¾ to 1 pound (0.34 to 0.45 kg) of mozzarella, you will need a gallon (3.8 L) of non-ultra pasteurized milk, rennet (either animal-based or vegetarian), citric acid, salt and a source of non-chlorinated water. (See recipe on page 35 for the amounts). You can use a gallon of normally pasteurized, store-bought whole or low-fat milk, but be sure to check the label to make sure it is not ultra pasteurized. Ultra pasteurizing heats milk proteins too high for cheesemaking purposes and your curd will not set properly. As a general rule of thumb, the more local the milk, the less likely it will be ultra pasteurized.

Milk can be whole, low fat or skim, however lower fat content in the milk will make cheese that is dryer and less flavorful. Also, if you purchase your citric acid or rennet in dry forms, dissolving the ingredients in non-chlorinated water is a must as the chlorine will break down the enzymes in the rennet and your curd may not set up properly. If you are using dried rennet and citric acid, dissolve them in water according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

For equipment, you will need a non-reactive, 6–8 quart (~6–8 L) stock pot (stainless steel or enamel is best), a non-reactive slotted spoon (plastic or stainless steel are best), a quick-read or cheese thermometer that can measure between 80 and 120 °F (27 and 49 °C), a stainless steel or plastic colander, a knife (preferably serrated) that reaches the bottom of the stock pot, a non-reactive 4–6 quart (4–6 L) sauce pan that can accommodate your colander, a 2-cup (473-mL) liquid measuring cup and a set of US measuring spoons (Photo 1). A pair of rubber gloves is also helpful.

Clean and Sanitize
Just like brewing, cheesemaking requires clean, sanitized equipment and surfaces. When making an unripened cheese like mozzarella, unwanted bacteria will not necessarily ruin your cheese but it can most definitely make someone sick. If you decide to go on to making other cheeses in the future, especially ripened cheese, bacterial contamination could not only make someone sick, they can also ruin your cheese, so carry your brewing cleaning and sanitation practices over when you make cheese. Treat your equipment and work area as you would if you were handling any other food — avoid any bacterial contamination. Wash all your surfaces and equipment with soap and water and follow up with an anti-microbial sanitizer. Bleach diluted in water works fine for cheesemaking. Keep a cup of it handy for re-sanitizing your spoon or thermometer should they become contaminated for any reason.

For this story, I ordered a "30 Minute Mozzarella" kit from The New England Cheesemaking Supply Company in Ashfield, Massachusetts, which contains powdered ingredients, a thermometer and a simple recipe, (adapted on page 35). A kit will make gathering your ingredients much easier, although you can purchase rennet and citric acid separately at any store that stocks cheesemaking supplies.

Troubleshooting
As simple as this recipe is, it’s safe to say that making mozzarella takes a little practice to get the hang of, so don’t feel bad about a funny batch or two. You will start to get the feel of what to look for when the curd sets up, how long to leave them in the rennet and how to stretch and form the curds as you become a more experienced cheesemaker. If you are very timid, try to find a local cheesemaker or cheesemaking supplier that can walk you through the process the first time. Just like brewing, cheese takes a little experimentation to get it just right.

If you find that you are having a lot of trouble getting the initial curd to set up, even after a few tries, you will probably have to try a different brand of milk. More local milk tends to be less pasteurized, and you can try buying milk from a local dairy if you’re really having trouble. This recipe should work for store-bought, homogenized milk, though, so try another brand first. Another problem may be that the water you used to dissolve the rennet and citric acid could be chlorinated, which will break down the enzymes in the rennet. Use bottled water next time as most bottled waters are not chlorinated. The curd may also not set up because you could be stirring the milk too much after adding the rennet. Be sure to only stir in the rennet for about 15 seconds just to incorporate it before allowing the milk to sit
very still.

If you are having trouble stretching the cheese, you may need to warm it up a little bit more by re-dipping in the water bath. If you’re still having trouble stretching, try using more citric acid in your next batch. The cheese’s acidity is what makes it pliable and stretchy, allowing you to work the curds into cheese. Too much acidity, however, can turn the cheese into a big mess. If you’re having trouble stretching the cheese with the amount of citric acid in this recipe, try increasing it by another
1 1/2 teaspoons.

If your cheese seems dry, and you are using something other than whole milk, consider trying whole milk next time. If you’re using whole milk and the cheese is still too dry for you, skip the heating and stirring step after cutting the curd. You could also try adding a little bit less citric acid to the milk (about 1/4 tsp.) or stretching the cheese less before chilling it down in the ice bath.

Your Cheesy Future
If you enjoy your first attempts at cheesemaking and would like to learn more, there are a lot of pathways to explore. In addition to soft cheeses, like mozzarella, there are also hard cheeses, cheeses ripened by mold or bacteria and a nearly endless variety of specialty cheeses. In the future, when someone asks you how your latest batch is aging, you may have to ask,
"beer or cheese?"


RECIPE:

Ingredients
1 gallon (3.8 L) of whole, low-fat or skim milk (not ultra pasteurized)
1 1/2 tsp. citric acid
1/4 – 1/2 rennet tablet or 1/4 tsp. liquid rennet
1 1/4 cup water (cool, non-chlorinated)
salt
icewater bath

Step by Step
Once you have all your materials together, start by dissolving the rennet tablet in 1/4 cup of the water (if you started from dry ingredients).

Dissolve the citric acid in the remaining cup of water.

Pour the milk into the large stock pot and add the dissolved citric acid. Stir well.

Put the pot of milk on the stove and heat the milk to 90 °F (32 °C). Continue to stir as the milk heats. When the milk reaches 90 °F (32 °C), take the pot off the stove and very gently stir in the rennet in an up-down motion for 15 seconds. It is crucial to the curd that you don’t over stir during this step as you may inadvertently cut the curd with your spoon, which can prevent your initial curd from setting up properly. Cover the pot and allow it to sit very still for about five minutes.


After five minutes have passed, remove the lid and check on the cheese curd. The curd should have set up in a solid, custard-like mass in the pot and you should be able to see a clear separation between the curd and the whey around the edge of the pot. You can put your spoon into the pot in between the edge of the pot and the curd and pull the curd away. If the curd hasn’t set up firmly, cover the pot again and let it sit for up to 15 minutes. If the curd still doesn’t set up, try heating the milk to 95 or 100 °F (35 or 38 °C). If the curd is still not setting up properly (ie: grainy and looks like ricotta), your milk may have been pasteurized at a high heat and the proteins will not form a curd. (If this happens, see the section on troubleshooting on page 38.)

Assuming your curd set up properly, the next step is cutting the curd. Take your knife and cut the curd in a checkerboard pattern from top to bottom and side-to-side, making cubes of about 3⁄8 of an inch. The curd should resemble a firm yogurt.

Once you’ve cut the curd, put the pot back on the heat, warm the curds and whey up to 110 °F (43 °C) and remove from the heat again and gently stir the curds for two to five minutes. This allows the curd to firm up a little bit more. The longer you stir, the firmer the finished cheese.

Now ladle your curds into the strainer to separate them from the whey. If you have a purpose for using the whey, such as making a batch of ricotta, reserve it to the side and store for another time. Otherwise discard the whey.

In the smaller sauce pan, heat a few quarts of water to 185 °F (85 °C). You may salt the water if you would like your finished cheese to be a little salty. Dip the colander of curds into the hot water bath, heating them up to about 135 °F (57 °C) or until they become gooey and stretchable. If you have a pair of rubber gloves, this is a good time to put them on as you will be working the hot curds with your hands.



When the curds get stretchy, start out by kneading them like a piece of bread dough on a clean surface, working gently at first. When the curd cools down and becomes less pliable, put it back in the colander and dip it in the water bath again. After a few cycles, you will see the cheese starting to get smooth and shiny. Drain off the whey as you work the cheese. At this point you can start stretching it like taffy instead of kneading. Alternately stretch the cheese and bring it back together until it becomes white and shiny, dipping back in the hot water bath as needed. You can add salt during the stretching process, as well as herbs or spices, if desired.

When you achieve a good stretchiness and a shiny look, form the mozzarella into a ball and plunge it into a cold water bath to cool and set for about ten minutes.


After the cheese is cooled and set, you can slice it up and enjoy it right away or wrap it in plastic wrap and store it in the refrigerator for up to three to five days. Mozzarella also freezes well in an airtight plastic bag with the air removed.

Mamacita's Dark Kölsch
Mamacita's Dark Kölsch
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.050 FG = 1.014
IBU = 27 SRM = 21 ABV = 4.7%

An homage to St. Arnold Brewing’s Santo, which was in the brewery’s regular rotation from 2011 until they discontinued brewing it in 2021.

Ingredients
4 lbs. (1.8 kg) American six-row malt
2.5 lbs. (1.1 kg) Munich dark malt (20 °L)
2.5 lbs. (1.1 kg) Munich light malt (10 °L)
1.5 lbs. (0.68 kg) flaked corn
3.5 oz. (100 g) Carafa® II (425 °L)
3 oz. (86 g) American chocolate malt (350 °L)
5 AAU Tettnanger hops (first wort hop) (1.1 oz./31 g at 4.5% alpha acids)
4.5 AAU Tettnanger hops (15 min.) (1 oz./28 g at 4.5% alpha acids)
SafAle K-97 or other Kölsch/German Ale yeast; SafLager 34/70 or other German lager yeast; or White Labs WLP 940 (Mexican Lager) yeast
¾ cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Mash in with 4.1 gallons (15.5 L) of water treated to moderate alkalinity at 152 °F (67 °C) and hold for 60 minutes if doing single-infusion mash. If doing a step mash, mash in at 144 °F (62 °C) for 30 minutes and then raise the temperature to 156 °F (69 °C) and rest an additional 30 minutes. Mash out at 170 °F (77 °C) for 10 minutes if desired. Recirculate the wort until clear, add first wort hops to the brew kettle and drain the first runnings into the kettle. Batch or fly sparge to collect 6.5 gallons (24.6 L) of wort, this should take approximately 4.1 gallons (15.5 L) of additional water.

Boil for 90 minutes, adding hops as indicated. Yeast nutrient and kettle finings may also be added, if desired.

Chill the wort to 2–3 °F (1–2 °C) below your yeast’s lowest recommended fermentation temperature and pitch an adequate quantity of healthy yeast (1 packet of dry ale yeast, 2–3 packets of dry lager yeast, or a minimum of a 3-L/3-quart starter of liquid yeast plus adequate oxygen). Let the temperature rise to the desired fermentation temperature, hold until high kräusen or half of extract has been consumed, then let the temperature rise uncontrolled.

When fermentation is complete, the beer benefits from lagering appropriate to the yeast type, 2–4 weeks for ale, 4–6 weeks if a lager yeast was used. Spund, force carbonate, or bottle condition to 2.5 volumes.

Partial mash option:
Replace the six-row and both Munich malts with 3.75 lbs. (1.7 kg) of light or Pilsen dried malt extract and 1.5 lbs. (0.68 kg) light Munich malt.

In order to convert the starch in the flaked corn, use about an equivalent (1.5 lbs./0.68 kg) of light Munich malt. Place both grains in a muslin bag and submerge in 5 quarts (4.8 L) of 164 °F (73 °C) water. The mash should stabilize around 152 °F (67 °C). Try to maintain this temperature for 45 minutes. In a separate small grain bag, add the crushed roasted malts. Steep those in the mash for the final 15 minutes. When one hour has passed, remove both bags, place them in a colander and slowly rinse them with 1 gallon (3.8 L) of hot water. Add water to make 3 gallons (11 L) of wort and stir in 2 lbs. (0.91 kg) of a light or Pilsen dried malt extract and the first wort hops.

Bring to a boil and boil for 60 minutes adding the second hop addition
for the final 15 minutes along with a yeast nutrient and kettle fining if desired. With 10 minutes remaining, add the remaining 1.75 lbs. (0.8 kg) Munich dried malt extract. After the boil is complete, chill the wort, transfer to your fermenter and top off to 5 gallons (19 L). Follow the remainder of the all-grain recipe.

Recipe Notes:
The name for this beer came from enjoying a beer at Mamacita’s restaurant in Pasadena, Texas that inspired this recipe. I didn’t know what the beer I ordered was, but I was enchanted! I took notes on the flavors (chocolate, malt, breadiness, low to no hop character, some maize flavor, no esters, table strength) and, unfortunately, forgot to ask what the beer was on the way out.

Back in Denver I attempted to reproduce it. The first brew was close, at least to my notes. It was a clean, dark lager, good chocolate notes, perhaps a bit more intense than I intended. I was on the sixth iteration before we were back in Pasadena. It was then that I sat at the bar and chatted with the bartender, eventually figuring out that the beer in question was Santo, a dark Kölsch from Saint Arnold Brewing. This recipe is iteration #9 for me, and the first I’ve done with a German ale yeast. Previously I’ve used a Mexican lager strain. Both versions are quite delicious. The key to success is to manage the fermentation well using temperature control appropriate to your chosen strain of yeast and pitching plenty of it.

Mango Habanero Cherry Bomb Sauce
Mango Habanero Cherry Bomb Sauce
(Approximately 60 fluid oz. (1.75 L) finished hot sauce)

Though not a beer recipe, this hot sauce made with Lactobacillus-fermented hot peppers is another use I have for my "kettle" souring keg. It’s a cleaner tasting alternative to vinegar-based sauces. The fruit adds sweetness that balances the heat. Use this sauce on eggs, burritos, pizza, or your favorite chip or cracker-like delivery vehicle.

Ingredients (day 1)
4 tbsp. corn sugar
1⁄2 Goodbelly StraightShot or 1 Swanson Probiotic L. plantarum capsule
48 fluid oz. (1.4 L) spring water or other dechlorinated water
4 oz. (0.11 kg) orange habanero peppers, sanitized, stemmed and quartered
16 oz. (0.45 kg) cherry peppers, sanitized, stemmed and cut into eighths
5 large cloves garlic, sanitized and crushed
Sea salt

Ingredients (after fermentation)
16 oz. (0.45 kg) mango chunks

Step by Step

Pre-Fermentation Process

Stir together the sugar, the Goodbelly or the contents of the L. plantarum capsule, and water in a mixing bowl. Add the prepared peppers and garlic. Weigh the mixed ingredients (excluding the weight of the bowl) and add sea salt equal to 3% of the other ingredients’ weight, stirring well.

Fermentation Process

Transfer ingredients to souring keg. Seal the keg and purge with CO2, leaving about 20 PSI of pressure in the headspace after purging.

Allow the L. plantarum to ferment the pepper mixture for about 3 days at 95 °F (35 °C) or about a week at room temperature, shaking/swirling the keg daily.

Post-Fermentation Process

Transfer the pepper mixture to a blender and blend until most of the seeds are no longer whole. Pour the contents into a pot and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until liquid is reduced by about 50%. Transfer to the blender and purée along with the mango chunks. Transfer to the kettle and heat to at least 180 °F (82 °C) and hold for at least 8 minutes. Bottle in sanitized bottles or jars and refrigerate until use.

Tips for success:

If fermenting in a container other than a dedicated souring keg, flood the container headspace (if possible) with CO2 and cover as tightly as possible. Keep the container close to 95 °F (35 °C).

Leaving 20 PSI of pressure in the souring keg’s headspace after purging helps ensure positive pressure to keep the
keg sealed.

If you do not have a spunding valve, check the keg’s pressure periodically and if the souring keg’s pressure actually increases (unlikely), bleed some of it off using the pressure relief valve.

Don’t worry if your souring keg’s thermowell doesn’t reach all the way down into the pepper mixture. It will still measure the temperature well enough.

This recipe makes a fairly thick, "toothy" sauce that can be poured very controllably without a "shaker" bottle insert. For a thinner sauce, you could skip the "simmer until reduced" step, but you’d need a blender larger than the typical 2-qt. (2-L) size, or would have to split the final purée step into two stages.

This recipe can easily be scaled up, with all ingredients
scaled proportionally, as there is plenty of room in the souring keg. However, the purée steps would have to be split into multiple stages.

As written, the recipe makes a sauce with a "medium" or "medium-plus" heat. For a hotter sauce, increase the habanero peppers and decrease the cherry peppers, while holding the total weight constant. For a smokier, less "citrusy" sauce, substitute red Fresno peppers for the cherry peppers. Finally, try other fruits (raspberries work well) as a substitute for some or all of the mango.

FG = 1.017 (4.4 °P)
IBU = 73 SRM = 48 ABV = 7.2%

Ingredients
13.47 lb. (6.11 kg) Great Western domestic pale malt (2 °L) (or similar)
14.46 oz. (410 g) Briess black barley (500 °L) (or similar)
10.93 oz. (310 g) Great Western crystal malt (40 °L) (or similar)
10.93 oz. (310 g) dark chocolate malt (420 °L)
15 AAU Horizon pellet hops (60 min.) (1.16 oz./33 g of 13% alpha acids)
7.6 AAU Centennial pellet hops (5 min.) (0.84 oz./24 g of 9% alpha acids)
White Labs WLP001 (California Ale) or Wyeast 1056 (American Ale) or Safale US-05 yeast

Step by step
Mill the grains and dough-in targeting a mash thickness that will allow your system to achieve the necessary pre-boil volume and gravity. Hold the mash at 154 °F (68 °C) until enzymatic conversion is complete. Infuse the mash with near boiling water while stirring, or with a recirculating mash system raise the temperature to mash out at 168 °F (76 °C). Sparge with 170 °F (77 °C) water, collecting wort until the pre-boil kettle volume is around 6.5 gallons (25 L) and the gravity is 1.056 (13.7 °P).

The total boil time is 90 minutes. Add the bittering hops with 60 minutes remaining in the boil. Add the remaining hop addition at 5 minutes. Chill the wort to 67 °F (19 °C) and aerate thoroughly. The proper pitch rate is 2.5 packages of liquid yeast or 1 package of liquid yeast in a 3.1-liter starter. Ferment at 67 °F (19 °C) until the yeast drops clear. Allow the lees to settle and the brew to mature without pressure for another two days after fermentation appears finished. Rack to a keg and force carbonate or rack to a bottling bucket, add priming sugar, and bottle. Target a carbonation level of 2.5 volumes.

Step by step
Mill or coarsely crack the specialty malt and place loosely in a grain bag. Avoid packing the grains too tightly in the bag. Steep the bag in about 1 gallon (~4 liters) of water at roughly 170 °F (77 °C) for about 30 minutes. Lift the grain bag out of the steeping liquid and rinse with warm water. Allow the bags to drip into the kettle while you add the malt extract. Do not squeeze the bags. Add enough water to the steeping liquor and malt extract to make a pre-boil volume of 5.9 gallons (22.3 L) and a gravity of 1.061 (15 °P). Stir thoroughly to help dissolve the extract and bring to a boil.

The total wort boil time is 60 minutes. Add the bittering hops as soon as the wort begins to boil. Add Irish moss or other kettle finings with 15 minutes left in the boil. Add the remaining hop addition at 5 minutes. Chill the wort to 67 °F (19 °C) and aerate thoroughly. The proper pitch rate is 2.5 packages of liquid yeast or 1 package of liquid yeast in a 3.1-liter starter. Ferment at 67 °F (19 °C) until the yeast drops clear. Follow the remaining carbonation and packaging instructions for the all-grain recipe.

Maple Beer
Maple Beer
(5 gallons/19 L, extract with grains)
OG = 1.041 FG = 1.010
IBU = 13 SRM = 16 ABV = 5.1%

The original gravity is calculated based on the estimated OG on brew day. The ABV is calculated based on the beer after the maple syrup addition. This volume of maple syrup will add ~8 gravity points to 5 gallons (19 L).

Ingredients
3.5 lbs. (1.6 kg) extra light dried malt extract
1 lb. (0.45 kg) crystal malt (80 °L)
0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) Maltodextrine
1 oz. (28 g) chocolate malt (500 °L)
6.6 gallons (25.1 L) maple sap (gravity of 1.005)
18.3 oz. (540 mL) maple syrup (darkest grade)
3.4 AAU Willamette hops (60 min.) (0.7 oz./20 g at 4.8% alpha acids)
1/2 tsp. yeast nutrient
1 Whirlfloc® tablet
1.5 oz. (40 g) American oak chips
Wyeast 1968 (London ESB) or White Labs WLP002 (English Ale) yeast
2/3 cup maple syrup (if priming)

Step by step
Heat the maple sap to about 160 °F (71 °C). Add the crushed grains in a muslin bag. Steep the grain for 20-30 minutes in the sap, then remove and allow the grains to drip back into the pot. Add the dried malt extract and bring to a boil. The pre-boil wort volume should be around 6.6 gallons (25.1 L) and a gravity of 1.034.

The total boil time is 60 minutes. Add hops according to the ingredients schedule. Add Whirlfloc® and yeast nutrient with 10 minutes left in the boil.

While the boil is taking place, use your oak chips to make a "tea." Do this by placing the chips in a small sauce pan and filling it with just enough water to cover the chips. Boil 10 minutes, remove from heat, cover the pot, and reserve.

At the end of the boil there should be about 5.5 gallons (21 L) of wort in your kettle. Chill the wort to 63 °F (17 °C), pitch the yeast and ferment at the same temperature until completion.

The remainder of this recipe is the same as the all-grain version (to the left).

Maple Imperial Stout
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.076* FG = 1.021
IBUs = ~35 SRM = 45 ABV = 9.6%
* Prior to maple syrup addition

Ingredients
10.5 lbs. (4.8 kg) 2-row pale malt
2 lbs. (0.9 kg) Munich malt
1 lb. (0.45 kg) flaked oats
1 lb. (0.45 kg) Carafa® III malt
0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) crystal malt (20 °L)
4 oz. (113 g) chocolate wheat malt
8.5 AAU Northern Brewer hops (60 min.) (1 oz./28 g at 8.5% alpha acids)
8.5 AAU Northern Brewer hops (5 min.) (1 oz./28 g at 8.5% alpha acids)
32 fl. oz. (950 mL) very dark maple syrup (secondary)
Wyeast 1318 (London Ale III), White Labs WLP066 (London Fog), or
LalBrew Verdant IPA yeast
3⁄4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Brewers with access to maple sap may replace all brewing water with sap for this recipe. Those without access to sap can add 0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) corn sugar as substitute. The gravity of maple sap for this recipe is assumed to be ~1.005, though this will vary — take a gravity reading of the sap before brewing to adjust accordingly.

Mash grains in sap at 154 °F (68 °C) for 60 minutes. Sparge as normal and boil for 60 minutes adding hops according to ingredients list. Cool the wort to fermentation temperature and aerate the wort if using a liquid strain.

Ferment at 69–72 °F (21–22 °C).When primary fermentation is complete, rack beer to secondary vessel, then add 32 fl. oz. (950 mL or 2.8 lbs./1.3 kg) very dark (previously called Grade C) maple syrup. Allow two to three weeks for additional fermentation before packaging as normal.

Maple Marzen
Maple Marzen
(5 gallons/19 L, extract with grains)
OG = 1.056 FG = 1.013
IBU = 31 SRM = 10 ABV = 5.7%

Ingredients
5 gals. (19 L) maple sap (if available) boiled down to 2.5 gals. (9.5 L)
0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) dark Munich malt (20° L)
0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) Carapils malt
1 oz. (28 g) chocolate malt
5 lbs. (2.3 kg) light dried malt extract
1 cup pure maple syrup
7.4 AAU Perle hops (45 min.) (1 oz./28 g at 7.4% alpha acids)
4 AAU Tettnanger hops (15 min.) (1 oz./28 g at 4% alpha acids)
Wyeast 2206 (Bavarian Lager) or White Labs WLP820 (Oktoberfest/Marzen Lager) yeast
3/4 cup granulated maple sugar or 1 cup of maple syrup for priming

Step by Step
In semi-condensed maple sap or in 2 gals. (7.6 L) of cold water, steep dark Munich, Carapils, and chocolate malts. Heat gradually up to 170 °F (77 °C) , remove grains, and wash with 2 qts. (2 L) hot water back into kettle. Bring up to boiling. Remove briefly from the heat and add malt extract and maple syrup (if you started with just water instead of sap, add 2 cups of maple syrup instead of 1). Return to heat and boil 15 minutes. Add Perle hops and boil 30 minutes. Add Tettnanger hops and boil 15 minutes more. Remove from heat, chill, add to fermenter, and top off to 5.25 gals. (20 L) with water or semi-condensed maple sap.

At 75 °F (24 °C) pitch a clean neutral lager yeast slurry and ferment at 65 to 70 °F (18 to 21 °C) for a day or so until active. Then cool down to 50 °F (10 °C) and ferment three to four weeks at this cool temperature. Rack to secondary, lager another five to six weeks. Prime with maple sugar or syrup. Age in bottles for a few months (make it in March; serve it at Oktoberfest!).

All-grain version: Swap out the dried malt extract with 9.5 lbs. (4.3 kg) of 2-row pale malt. You will need roughly 3.5 gallons (13.3 L) of either strike water or sap (semi-condensed or not). Mash at 152 °F (67 °C) for one hour. If you have enough, you can swap out the sparge water for sap. Boil for a total of 60 minutes, adding 2 cups of maple syrup if you did not use any maple sap.

Note on Maple Syrup
I can't emphasize enough how important it is to use real, pure maple syrup or fresh sap. Your choice of maple products will influence the beer:

Fresh sap, because it is less processed to begin with, will give a lighter flavor but noticeable sweetness and will not affect the color. Fancy grade-A syrup will not change the color much either but will give a richer flavor. Darker syrups (which I prefer) will give more amber color, more smoky sweetness, and some woody character to the beer. Use what you have access to, of course, but I recommend going for the "coarser" products. They're usually a little less expensive, too.

Patience is very important with this brew. Maple sugar, like honey, is very complex and takes a long time to ferment. When this beer is young, it may be phenolic and even sour. These flavors will mellow with age, even disappear after a couple months of conditioning. So follow my recommended aging schedule. You don't want to look like a sap in front of your Oktoberfest guests.

Market Garden Brewery's Progress Pilsner clone
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.050 FG = 1.008
IBU = 37 SRM = 4 ABV = 5.5%

Progress Pilsner, created in the style of a German Pilsner, is one of three year-round beers at Market Garden Brewery in Cleveland, Ohio.

Ingredients
9 lbs. (4.1 kg) Avangard German Pilsener malt
0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) Weyermann Carahell® malt (10 °L)
0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) acidulated malt
3.5 AAU Czech Saaz hops (first wort hop) (1 oz./28 g at 3.5% alpha acids)
3.5 AAU Czech Saaz hops (60 min.) (1 oz./28 g at 3.5% alpha acids)
1 AAU Spalter Select hops (30 min.)  (0.5 oz./14 g at 2% alpha acids)
3.5 AAU Czech Saaz hops (10 min.) (1 oz./28 g at 3.5% alpha acids)
2 oz. (57 g) Czech Saaz hops (0 min.)
White Labs WLP830 (German Lager) or Wyeast 2124 (Bohemian Lager) yeast
3/4 cup (150 g) dextrose (if priming)

Step by Step
This is a multi-step mash. Start with 5 gallons (19 L) of low carbonate strike water. This is a ratio of 2 quarts per pound of grain (4.2 L/kg) to provide a thin mash with high enzymatic activity. Follow this mash schedule: Start at 131 °F (55 °C) and hold for 10 minutes for the protein rest. Raise the grain bed to 145 °F (63 °C) and hold for 30 minutes for beta amylase conversion. Raise the grain bed to 158 °F (70 °C) and hold for 10–15 minutes until starch conversion is complete. Finally raise the grain bed to 170 °F (77 °C) for mash out. Sparge with enough water to collect 7.1 gallons (26.8 L) of wort pre-boil. Add the first wort hops during the sparge. Bring the wort to a boil, and add the hops according to the ingredients list. Boil for 90 minutes. Chill to 48–50 °F (9–10 °C), aerate, and pitch the yeast. Ferment at 52 °F (11 °C) until around 1.012 SG, then let the temperature rise to 56–58 °F (13–14 °C) for a diacetyl rest. After 72 hours at terminal gravity, drop the temperature 2–3 °F (1-1.5 °C) per day until you reach 40 °F (4 °C). Transfer the beer to a secondary and slowly cool to 28 °F ( -2 °C) (or as close to freezing as you can without freezing) for 6 to 8 weeks until clear. Bottle or keg as usual.

Extract with grain option:
Replace the Pilsner and acidulated malts with 6.6 lbs. (3 kg) Pilsen liquid malt extract and 7 mL lactic acid (88%). Steep the crushed malt in 5 gallons (19 L) as the water heats up. When the water hits 170 °F (21 °C) remove the grains. Remove from brewpot from heat and add the lactic acid, Pilsen liquid malt and first wort hops. Stir until all the extract is fully dissolved and bring to a boil. Boil for 60 minutes adding the remaining hops according to the ingredients list. After the boil, top up to 5 gallons (19 L) and follow the remainder of the all-grain recipe.

(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.054FG = 1.014
IBU = 30SRM = 11ABV = 5.2%

A traditional Vienna-style lager that has a semi-dry, toasted malt finish. A great session beer and a menu mainstay since Market Garden Brewery’s opening in Cleveland, Ohio in 2011.

Ingredients
8 lbs. (3.6 kg) Vienna malt
2.5 lbs. (1.1 kg) dark Munich malt(20 °L)
1 lb. (0.45 kg) biscuit malt
0.5 lb. (0.22 kg) acidulated malt
5 AAU Hallertau Tradition hops (60 min.) (1 oz./28g at 5% alphaacids)
2.5 AAU Hallertau Tradition hops (20 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 5%alpha acids)
3.25 AAU Hallertau Tradition hops (10 min.) (0.65 oz./18 g at 5%alpha acids)
1 oz. (28 g) Hallertau Tradition hops (0 min.)
White Labs WLP830 (German Lager) or Wyeast 2124 (Bohemian Lager) or Saflager W-34/70 yeast
3⁄4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Using high-quality malts and a grist of 3-to-1 water-to-grain weight ratio (~1.5 qts/lb), perform a step mash beginning with a 131 °F (55 °C) protein rest. Each step should be about 20 minutes. Raise temperature to 145°F (63 °C) to convert beta amylase before raising to 158 °F (70 °C) for alpha amylase conversion. Finally, mash out at 170 °F (77 °C). Sparge with 5 gallons (19 L) of water at 170 °F (77 °C) and collect 6.75 gallons (25.5 L) of wort.

Boil for 75 minutes. If you choose to add any fining agents such as Whirlfloc or Irish moss, do so with 10 minutes remaining in the boil. At flameout, whirlpool the beer and add the final hop addition. Give the wort a long stir and let settle for 10 minutes. Chill rapidly to 52 °F (11 °C). Pitch the yeast and oxygenate thoroughly.

Ferment at 52 °F (11 °C) for seven days before raising temperature to 56–60 °F for a 2-day diacetyl rest. Once complete, slowly drop the temperature a few degrees per day until reaching 40 °F (4 °C) over the course of a week. Once 40 °F (4 °C) is achieved, drop the temperature to 30 °F (-1 °C) for cold conditioning. Lager the beer for four weeks. Force carbonate to 2.5 volumes or prime and bottle condition. If bottle conditioning, leave the beer at 70–75 °F (21–24 °C) for about two weeks.

Step by Step
Heat 2 gallons (7.6 L) of water to 161 °F (72 °C) and place large steeping bag containing the crushed grains into a 5-gallon
(19-L) pot. Submerge the bag and stir grains to ensure sufficient hydration. Mash for 45 minutes targeting a mash temperature of 149 °F (65 °C). Remove bag from pot and sparge with 170 °F (77 °C) water to collect 2.25 gallons (9.5 L) of wort.

Top off kettle with water to make 3 gallons (11 L) and stir in 2 lbs. (0.91 kg) of the Vienna malt extract. Adding this amount of extract here will improve the isomerization of the bittering hops. When the extract is dissolved, bring to a boil for 60 minutes, adding hops according to the schedule. If you choose to add any fining agents such as Whirlfloc or Irish moss, do so with 10 minutes remaining in the boil. Add remaining malt extract in the last 15 minutes of the boil.

At flameout, add the final hop addition, then give the wort a long stir and let settle for 10 minutes.. Cool wort to 52 °F (11 °C) and rack to fermenter. Top off wort with pre-chilled water to bring volume up to 5 gallons (19 L). Oxygenate thoroughly and pitch yeast.

Follow the fermentation, lagering, and packaging instructions outlined in the all-grain version of this recipe.

American-Style Lager
American-Style Lager
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.046 FG = 1.008
IBU = 15 SRM = 2–4 ABV = 4.9%

Ingredients
7 lbs. (3.2 kg) 2-row pale malt
2.5 lbs. (1.1 kg) raw rice or corn
0.25 lb. (113 g) acidulated malt
12 AAU Mt. Hood hops (60 min.) (2 oz./56 g at 6% alpha acids)
0.5 oz. (14 g) Mt. Hood hops (dry hop) (optional)
White Labs WLP080 (Cream Ale Yeast Blend) or a packet each of SafAle S-04 and SafLager W-34/70 yeast
3⁄4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by step
Mill the 2-row malt and remove half a pound (0.23 kg) for use in the cereal mash process; set the rest aside for now. Crush the raw grain and add it plus the half pound (0.23 kg) of 2-row you set aside into a muslin or nylon mesh bag and secure the top.

Heat 1.25 gallons (5 L) of water (4:1 water-to-grist) in a large pot to the proper strike temperature for a 158 °F (70 °C) mash rest. Add the bag(s) of grain to the pot and rest at 158 °F (70 °C) for 15–30 minutes (this is also an opportunity to use White Labs Ultra-Ferm if you choose). It is important to make every effort to keep the grain off the bottom of the pot to avoid scorching. This can be achieved by suspending the bags with clips on the rim of the pot or good old-fashioned constant stirring.

After the initial rest, bring the pot up to boiling for no less than 30 minutes. When the pot begins to boil, start your regular mash-in regimen with the remaining milled 2-row and acidulated malt in a separate pot at a 3:1 water-to-grist (approximately 3.5 gallons/13 L). Target an initial mash temperature around 130 °F (54 °C). As the cereal mash is done boiling, if you timed things up correctly, you are ready to raise the temperature of your larger mash to your desired saccharification temperature. Carefully add the boiled grain and liquid into your larger mash; add additional hot liquor or heat if necessary to raise the temperature to the desired temperature. From this point, vorlauf and sparge as you normally would.

Boil the wort for 60 minutes, adding hops at the beginning of the boil. Add kettle finings like Irish moss or Whirlfloc, if desired, with 15 minutes left in the boil. Chill wort to 50 °F (10 °C), aerate thoroughly, then pitch yeast. Ferment at 50 °F (10 °C) for ten days. On day ten, allow the temperature to rise for another 7 days until it reaches no higher than 62 °F (17 °C). At this point, rack the beer into another carboy and allow another 3 weeks at 45 °F (7 °C) before packaging. You may also add an optional dry hop during the transfer to secondary, but tread lightly so as to not conceal the grain’s flavor.

An optional alternative approach to this or other similar recipes would substitute koji-fermented grain in for the raw grain and omit the cereal mash process. While brew day is made easier, the steps to produce the koji-fermented grains are meticulous, time-consuming, and require ample foresight. Also, be prepared for quite a different flavor profile if you choose this method, especially depending on your koji spore of choice; my favorite koji for brewing is any used in sake production.

Maui Brewing Co.’s flagship porter, flavored with hand-toasted coconut.

Ingredients
8 lbs. (3.6 kg) Maris Otter pale malt
12 oz. (0.34 kg) pale chocolate malt
4 oz. (113 g) caramel malt (80 °L)
4 oz. (113 g) Special B malt
2 oz. (57 kg) chocolate malt
8 oz. (0.23 kg) dark candi syrup (15 min.)
1 lb. (0.45 kg) corn sugar (15 min.)
8.3 AAU Golding hop pellets (60 min.) (1.15 oz./33 g at 7.2% alpha acids)
1 lb. (0.45 kg) shredded coconut, toasted (secondary)
Wyeast 2007 (Pilsen Lager) or Wyeast 1272 (American Ale II) yeast
3⁄4 cups corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
On brew day, prepare your ingredients; mill the grain, measure your hops, and prepare your water. This recipe uses reverse osmosis (RO) water. Add 1 tsp. gypsum (CaSO4), 1⁄2 tsp. calcium chloride (CaCl2) and 2 tsp. calcium carbonate (CaCO3) to the mash per 10 gallons of RO water.

Heat to 3.5 gallons (13.3 L) strike water to achieve a stable mash temperature at 152 °F (67 °C). Raise to mash out and begin to lauter. Boil for 90 minutes, adding the hops after 30 minutes at a boil, and the corn sugar and dark candi syrup with 15 minutes left in the boil. After you turn off the heat, chill the wort to yeast pitching temperature and oxygenate heavily. Ferment at 50–55 °F (10–13 °C) if using the lager strain and 60–65 °F (16–18 °C) if using the ale strain.

After fermentation is complete, toast the shredded coconut (non-sweetened, no preservative) at low oven temperature (~250 °F/121 °C) flipping often to avoid burning, until golden brown. The reaction may take as little as 10–15 minutes or as much as 25–30 minutes. Add the coconut to secondary in a sanitized bag. Age on the coconut for 24 hours to 4 days. If flavor is lacking, follow up with coconut extract at packaging time. It is recommended to lager the beer for a couple weeks before drinking to clarify and help remove coconut solids. Bottle with priming sugar or force carbonate the serving keg to 2.4 volumes CO2.

Ingredients
4.5 lbs. (2 kg) dark dried malt extract (17 °L)
12 oz. (0.34 kg) pale chocolate malt
4 oz. (113 g) caramel malt (80 °L)
4 oz. (113 g) Special B malt
2 oz. (57 kg) chocolate malt

3⁄4 cups corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
On brew day, prepare your ingredients; mill the grain, measure your hops, and prepare your water. This recipe uses reverse osmosis (RO) water. Add 1 tsp. gypsum (CaSO4), 1⁄2 tsp. calcium chloride (CaCl2) and 2 tsp. calcium carbonate (CaCO3) to the mash per 10 gallons of RO water.

Heat to 5.5 gallons (21 L) brewing water and place the crushed grain in a muslin bag. Steep the grains in the brewing water for 20 minutes as the water heats up. Remove the grain bag when the temperature reaches 170 °F (77 °C). Remove from heat and stir in the dried malt extract. Once the extract is fully dissolved, bring the wort to a boil and boil for 60 minutes, adding the hops once a boil is achieved. Add the corn sugar and dark candi syrup with 15 minutes left in the boil. After you turn off the heat, chill the wort to yeast pitching temperature and oxygenate heavily. Ferment at 50-55 °F (10-13 °C) if using the lager strain and 60-65 °F (16-18 °C) if using the ale strain.

After fermentation is complete, toast the shredded coconut (non-sweetened, no preservative) at low oven temperature (~250 °F/121 °C) flipping often to avoid burning, until golden brown. The reaction may take as little as 10–15 minutes or as much as 25–30 minutes. Add the coconut to secondary in a sanitized bag. Age on the coconut for 24 hours to 4 days. If flavor is lacking, follow up with coconut extract at packaging time. It is recommended to lager the beer for a couple weeks before drinking to clarify and help remove coconut solids. Bottle with priming sugar or force carbonate the serving keg to 2.4 volumes CO2.

Tips for Success:
Instead of a direct addition of coconut, you could also add the coconut to this recipe as a homemade extract. To do this, the day before brew day fill a 1-gallon (3.8-L) glass jar with shredded coconut and a moderate quality vodka. Let the coconut steep in the vodka until your beer is finished fermenting, and then add the extract to the finished beer to taste.

IBU = 27SRM = 7.5ABV = 5.5%

A lighter, Mexican amber interpretation of the traditional Vienna-style lager from McFate Brewing Co. in Scottsdale, Arizona.

Ingredients
6.4 lbs. (2.9 kg) Weyermann Pilsner malt
3.5 lbs. (1.6 kg) Weyermann Vienna malt
2.25 oz. (64 g) acidulated malt
6 oz. (172 g) dextrose corn sugar
1 oz. (28 g) Weyermann Carafa® Special III (600 °L)
6.4 AAU Warrior hops (60 min.) (0.4 oz./11 g at 16% alpha acids)
1 oz. (28 g) Czech Saaz hops (0 min.)
1⁄2 tsp. Irish moss or Whirlfloc (15 min.)
White Labs WLP830 (German Lager) or Wyeast 2124 (Bohemian Lager) or Saflager W-34/70 yeast
3⁄4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Using a very loose mash with a 4-to-1 water to grain weight ratio (~1.9 qts./lb.), target a mash temperature of 150 °F (66 °C) and perform a single-infusion mash for 30 minutes or until proper conversion has occurred. Recirculate your wort through the grain bed until clear then sparge with a maximum of 3 gallons (11 L) of sparge water. The loose mash should provide a majority of the water needed. If your runoff goes above a pH of 5.5, add water to top off instead of running the risk of pulling any astringency from the spent grain bed.

Boil for 90 minutes, adding hops and fining agents as indicated. At flameout, rapidly chill the wort to 48 °F (9 °C) and pitch plenty of healthy yeast. Oxygenate thoroughly. Keep at 48 °F (9 °C) for 4 days, then raise to 54 °F (12 °C) for a diacetyl rest for about 6 days. Not only will this take care of any diacetyl issues, the elevated temperatures will help ferment some remaining sugars, giving the beer a slightly drier character. Starting on day 11, lower the temperature 2 °F (1 °C) per day until reaching 40 °F (4 °C). Hold it at this temperature for 7 days then drop it to 32 °F (0 °C) for transfer to keg to drop out any additional yeast still in suspension.

Force carbonate to 2.5 volumes or prime and bottle condition leaving the bottles at 70–75 °F (21–24 °C) for two weeks to properly condition. Serve in a Pilsner glass at approximately 45–48 °F (7–9 °C).

White Labs WLP830 (German Lager) or Wyeast 2124 (Bohemian Lager) or Saflager W-34/70 yeast
3⁄4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Place crushed de-bittered Carafa® III malt into a steeping bag and submerge in 2.5 gallons (9.5 L) of water as the water heats up. Remove steeping grains when water temperature reaches 155 °F (68 °C). Remove pot from heat and add 3 lbs. (1.4 kg) of the Pilsen malt extract, stirring well. Add water to boil kettle to bring volume up to 3.5 gallons (13.2 L). Resume heating brew kettle and boil for 60 minutes, adding hops and fining agents according to the ingredient list. Add remaining malt extract and corn sugar in the last 15 minutes of the boil. Cool wort to 48 °F (9 °C) and rack to fermenter. Top off wort with pre-chilled water to bring volume up to 5 gallons (19 L). Oxygenate thoroughly and pitch yeast.

Keep at 48 °F (9 °C) for 4 days, then raise to 54 °F (12 °C) for a diacetyl rest for about 6 days. Not only will this take care of any diacetyl issues, the elevated temperatures will help ferment some remaining sugars, giving the beer a slightly drier character.

McKenzie’s Brew House’s Saison Vautour clone
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.057 FG = 1.006
IBU = 30 SRM = 4 ABV = 6.7%

Saison Vautour is named for the vultures that ominously circle the brewery on brew days. This is the recipe for McKenzie’s Brew House’s multi-gold-medal-winning rye saison from head brewer Ryan Michaels. It’s a good example of how a very simple recipe can result in a beer of extraordinary complexity. The clean version has a wonderful rustic character from the rye and yeast, while the barrel-aged version adds some tartness and funk.

Ingredients
9 lbs. (4.1 kg) Pilsner malt
2 lbs. (0.91 kg) rye malt
0.50 lbs. (0.23 kg) soft blond candi sugar
5.1 AAU Hallertau Tradition hops (60 min.) (1.3 oz./37 g of 4% alpha acids)
1.5 AAU Hallertau Tradition hops (15 min.) (0.35 oz./10 g of 4% alpha acids)
1.25 AAU East Kent Goldings hops (15 min.) (0.25 oz./7.1 g of 5% alpha acids)
1.5 AAU Hallertau Tradition hops (5 min.)
1.25 AAU East Kent Goldings hops (5 min.)
White Labs WLP566 (Belgian Saison II) yeast
4.5 oz. (127 g) table sugar (for priming)

Step by Step
Mash at 145 °F (63 °C) for 60 minutes. Boil for 90 minutes adding hops as indicated. Start fermentation at 60 °F (16 °C) and allow to rise into the mid-80s °F (28–29 °C). When the gravity is stable, bottle with enough priming sugar to reach 2.5 volumes of CO2.

To mimic the barrel-aged version, rack to secondary and add 1 oz. (28 g) of medium toast French oak cubes (boiled to extract excess tannins and to sanitize), along with either a pack of Wyeast Lambic Blend (WY3278) or the dregs from two bottles of your favorite unpasteurized sour beer. Allow the gravity to stabilize before bottling, aiming for 2.5 volumes of carbonation.

Partial Mash Equivalent:
Replace the Pilsner malt with 0.50 lbs. (0.23 kg) of table sugar and 4.25 lbs. (1.9 kg) of Pilsner dried malt extract. Mash the rye malt for 45 minutes at 150 °F (66 °C) before adding the extract and sugar.

IBU = 28 SRM = 35 ABV = 5.1%

Ingredients

8.5 lb. (3.85 kg) Thomas Fawcett & Sons Maris Otter pale ale malt (or similar English pale ale malt)
14.1 oz. (400 g) Great Western flaked oats 1 °L
10.6 oz. (300 g) Briess Victory® malt 28 °L
10.6 oz. (300 g) Thomas Fawcett & Sons chocolate malt 350 °L
7.1 oz. (200 g) Thomas Fawcett & Sons roasted barley 500 °L
7.1 oz. (200 g) Thomas Fawcett & Sons crystal malt 85 °L
7.5 AAU Kent Goldings pellet hops (60 min.) (1.5 oz./42 g at 5% alpha acids)
White Labs WLP002 (English Ale) or Wyeast 1968 (London ESB) yeast

Step by Step

Spread the flaked oats out on a cookie sheet and toast them in the oven around 300 °F (149 °C) until they begin to slightly color up and give off a nutty oatmeal cookie character. Mill all of the grains together and dough-in targeting a mash of around 1.5 quarts of water to 1 pound of grain (a liquor-to-grist ratio of about 3:1 by weight) and a temperature of 154 °F (68 °C). Hold the mash at 154 °F (68 °C) until enzymatic conversion is complete. Infuse the mash with near-boiling water while stirring or with a recirculating mash system raise the temperature to mash out at 168 °F (76 °C). Sparge slowly with 170 °F (77 °C) water, collecting wort until the pre-boil kettle volume is around 5.9 gallons (22.3 L) and a gravity of 1.046 (11.5 °P).

The total wort boil time is 60 minutes. Add the hops once the wort reaches a full boil and then start your timer. Add Irish moss or other kettle finings with 15 minutes left in the boil.
Chill the wort to 68 °F (20 °C) and aerate thoroughly. The proper pitch rate is two packages of liquid yeast or 1 package of liquid yeast in a 2-liter starter. Ferment at 68 °F (20 °C). When fermentation is finished, carbonate the beer to approximately 2 to 2.5 volumes.

Step by Step

Ask your local homebrew shop for an English-style liquid malt extract or an extract made from 100% Maris Otter malt. If you cannot get fresh liquid malt extract, it is better to use an appropriate amount of dried malt extract (DME) instead.

Spread the flaked oats out on a cookie sheet and toast them in the oven around 300 °F (149 °C) until they begin to slightly color up and give off a nutty oatmeal cookie character. Mill or coarsely crack the oats with the rest of the specialty malt and place loosely in a grain bag. Avoid packing the grains too tightly in the bag, using more bags if needed. Steep the bag in about 1 gallon (~4 liters) of water at roughly 170 °F (77 °C) for about 30 minutes. Lift the grain bag out of the steeping liquid and rinse with warm water. Allow the bags to drip into the kettle. Do not squeeze the bags. Add the malt extract and enough water to make a pre-boil volume of 5.9 gallons (22.3 L) and a gravity of 1.046 (11.5 °P). Stir thoroughly to help dissolve the extract and bring to a boil.

The total wort boil time is 60 minutes. Add the hops once the wort reaches a full boil and then start your timer. Add Irish moss or other kettle finings with 15 minutes left in the boil.

Chill the wort to 68 °F (20 °C) and aerate thoroughly. The proper pitch rate is 2 packages of liquid yeast or 1 package of liquid yeast in a 2 liter starter. Ferment at 68 °F (20 °C). When fermentation is finished, carbonate the beer to approximately 2 to 2.5 volumes.

(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.099 FG = 1.026
IBU = 28 SRM = 20 ABV = 10.6%

Ingredients
17.8 lbs. (8.1 kg) British pale ale malt
17.6 oz. (0.5 kg) crystal malt (45 °L)
14.1 oz. (0.4 kg) Munich malt (8 °L)
7 oz. (0.2 kg) crystal malt (120 °L)
1.8 oz. (50 g) roasted barley (500 °L)
6.5 AAU Kent Goldings hops (60 min.) (1.3 oz./37 g at 5% alpha acids)
2 AAU Kent Goldings hops (10 min.) (0.4 oz./11 g at 5% alpha acids)
1 tsp Irish moss (optional)
White Labs WLP028 (Edinburgh Ale) or Wyeast 1728 (Scottish Ale) yeast

Step by Step
When I homebrew, I use Crisp Malting's British Pale Ale malt (made from Maris Otter) as my base grain, but other malts of a similar nature should work well. Remember, the bulk of the flavor comes from the base grain, so try to get British pale ale malt.

Currently I use the Thomas Fawcett crystal and pale chocolate malts, as they have a great flavor that is very British. For Munich malt we're currently using Best Malz. For any of these malts, feel free to substitute any high quality malt of a similar flavor and color from a different supplier. My hops are in pellet form and come from Hop Union, Willamette Valley, or Hopsteiner depending on the variety.

Mill the grains and dough-in targeting a mash of around 1.5 qts. (1.4 L) of water to 1 pound (0.45 kg) of grain (a liquor-to-grist ratio of about 3:1 by weight) and a temperature of 154 °F (68 °C). Hold the mash at 154 °F (68 °C) until enzymatic conversion is complete. Infuse the mash with near- boiling water while stirring or with a recirculating mash system raise the temperature to mash out at 168 °F (76 °C). Sparge slowly with 170 °F (77 °C) water, collecting wort until the pre-boil kettle volume is around 6.5 gallons (25 L) and the gravity is 1.076. If you should come up short on the pre-boil gravity, top it off with some dried malt extract (DME).

The total wort boil time is 90 minutes. This helps concentrate the wort and aids in the development of flavor compounds. You should check the gravity of your wort before you add your first hop addition. If the boil is not tracking according to plan, keep boiling until you are at the right gravity, and then add your first hop addition. The first hop addition comes with 60 minutes remaining in the boil. If you wish, add Irish moss or other kettle finings with 15 minutes left in the boil and the final hop addition with 10 minutes left.

Chill the wort to 65 °F (18 °C) and aerate thoroughly. The proper pitch rate is 3 packages of liquid yeast, or 1 package of liquid yeast in a 1.5-gallon (6 L) starter. Ferment at 65 °F (18 °C) to start, raising the temperature gradually to 70 °F (21 °C) for the last 1⁄3 of fermentation. When finished, carbonate the beer to approximately 2 volumes CO2.

Step by Step
Ask your local homebrew shop for an English-style liquid malt extract. If they do not have any, many online suppliers sell an English-style extract made from 100% Maris Otter malt. Always choose the freshest extract that fits the beer style. If you cannot get fresh liquid malt extract, it is better to use an appropriate amount of dried malt extract (DME) instead.

Mill or coarsely crack the specialty malt and place loosely in a grain bag. Avoid packing the grains too tightly in the bag, using more bags if needed. Steep the bag in about 1 gallon (~4 L) of water at roughly 170 °F (77 °C) for about 30 minutes. Lift the grain bag out of the steeping liquid and rinse with warm water. Allow the bags to drip into the kettle for a few minutes while you add the malt extract. Do not squeeze the bags. Add enough water to the steeping liquor and malt extract to make a pre-boil volume of 6.5 gallons (25 L) and a gravity of 1.076. Stir thoroughly to help dissolve the extract and bring to a boil.

IBU = 21 SRM = 5 ABV = 5.3%

Ingredients
5.5 lbs. (2.5 kg) German wheat malt
4 lbs. (1.8 kg) North American 2-row malt
1 lb. (454 g) Munich malt
8 oz. (227 g) caravienne malt or caramel (20 °L) malt
2.25 AAU Czech Saaz hops (first wort hop) (0.75 oz./21 g at 3.0% alpha acid)
2.6 AAU Hallertauer hops (20 min.) (0.75 oz./21 g at 3.5% alpha acid)
2.6 AAU Hallertauer hops (10 min.) (0.75 oz./21 g at 3.5% alpha acid)
1 oz. (28 g) Czech Saaz hops (5 min.)
1 oz. (28 g) Cascade hops (dry hop)
Wyeast 1272 (American Ale II) or White Labs WLP051 (California Ale V) or Mangrove Jack’s M36 (Liberty Bell Ale) yeast
3⁄4 cup (150 g) corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
This recipe uses reverse osmosis (RO) water. Adjust all brewing water to a pH of 5.5 using phosphoric acid. Add 1 tsp of calcium chloride to the mash.

Mash in all malts at 131 °F (55 °C) and rest for 10 minutes. Pull a thick decoction (about 1⁄3 of the mash volume, thick part only) and heat it through the following steps: 149 °F (65 °C) rest for 15 minutes, 158 °F (70 °C) rest for 15 minutes, boil for 15 minutes. Use direct heat or infusion with boiling water to raise temperatures.

Meanwhile, after pulling the decoction above, raise the temperature in the main mash to 149 °F (65 °C) and hold while the decoction steps are in process. Remix the boiled decoction into the main mash to hit a mash temperature of 158 °F (70 °C) and hold for 20 minutes. Mash out at 168 °F (76 °C) for 10 minutes, recirculating wort during this time.Fly sparge with 170 °F (77 °C) water, collecting 6.5 gallons (25L) of wort.

Boil the wort for 90 minutes, adding hops at the times indicated in the recipe. First wort hops are added directly to the boil kettle before lautering and sparging.
Chill the wort to 68 °F (20 °C), pitch the yeast, and ferment until complete. Rack the beer, add the dry hops for 3 days at room temperature. Rack and package the beer, or rack and clarify the beer if desired with finings before packaging (prime and bottle condition, or keg and force carbonate).

White Labs WLP002 (English Ale) or Wyeast 1968 (London ESB Ale) yeast
1–1 1⁄2 oz. (28–42 g) corn sugar (for priming)

Step by Step
Steep crushed grains in 2 qts. (2 L) water at 140–160 °F (60–71 °C) for 20 mins. Strain liquid into boil pot, and rinse grains with further 2 qts. (2 L) hot water. Add 3 gallons (11.5 L) to collected liquors, and dissolve the liquid malt extract, then dried malt extract. Top up to 5 gallons (19 L) with water and bring to boil. Add bittering hops and boil 60 mins; add rest of hops when heat is turned off. Cool to 65–70 °F (18–21 °C), and pitch yeast (preferably as a 1 qt. (1 L) active starter). Ferment five to seven days, then rack into secondary for up to one week. Bottle or keg with priming sugar, using as little sugar as possible (depending upon the residual carbonation level of the beer); 1–11⁄2 oz. (28–42 g) corn sugar would be my recommendation, as you are shooting for a beer at a little under 2 volumes CO2. Higher carbonation levels can "drown out" the nuances of this mild ale.

OG = 1.050 FG = 1.013
IBU = 32 SRM = 14 ABV = 4.8%

Sadly, Merriman’s Brewery in Leeds is apparently no longer brewing. The information that I have for this beer is: OG: 1.050. Malt bill: Halcyon pale malt, crystal malt, wheat malt, pale chocolate malt, roast barley. Hops: Liberty, Progress. IBU: 32. When one has no information about malt bill proportions, the only option is to guess. However, we are aware of the usual style guideline ranges for using specialty grains, so we can use these as a starting point. Accordingly, I produced the following recipe:

Ingredients
9.5 pounds (4.3 kg) Halcyon pale malt
2.5 oz. (70 g) crystal malt (60 °L)
2.5 oz. (70 g) wheat malt
1.25 oz. (35 g) chocolate malt
1.25 oz. (35 g) roast barley
4 AAU Progress hops (60 min.) (0.67 oz./19 g of 6% alpha acid)
2.7 AAU Liberty hops (60 min.) (0.67 oz./19 g of 4% alpha acid)
4 AAU Progress hops (5 min.) (0.67 oz./19 g of 6% alpha acid)
2.7 AAU Liberty hops (5 min.) (0.67 oz./19 g of 4% alpha acid)
1 tsp. Irish moss (15 min.)
SafAle S-04 or Wyeast 1099 (Whitbread Ale) yeast

Step by Step
150 °F (66 °C) infusion mash temp for 60 minutes. 60-minute boil time. Ferment at 68 °F (20 °C). This recipe produced a beer which developed a lovely fruit-bitterness balance. I admit that I have no idea how it compares to the real thing, and now I have no way of knowing, so this is probably not a true clone recipe. However, it inspired me to design a recipe that produced a very pleasant ale. Maybe brewing in this way could be regarded as paying respects to a deceased beer rather than a serious attempt at resurrection via cloning. I have found that using my database in this way has led me to brew fine beers from recipes that I doubt I would have created from scratch myself.

Recirculate for 15 minutes. Fly sparge with 168 °F (76 °C) water until 6.5 gallons (24.5 L) of wort is collected.

Boil the wort for 75 minutes, adding the hops at times indicated in the recipe. The first wort hops get added to the kettle after lautering but before a boil is reached. After the boil is complete, chill the wort down to 50 °F (10 °C) and rack to the fermenter.

Oxygenate, then pitch the yeast. Ferment at 50 °F (10 °C) until complete. At this point it is recommended to remove the beer from the yeast cake by either tranferring to a secondary vessel purged of oxygen or gently racking trying to avoid oxidation as best as possible. If your fermenter has a yeast dump valve, you can simply remove the yeast through the bottom valve. Lager for 4 to 8 weeks at 32 °F (0 °C). Rack the beer, prime and bottle condition, or keg and force carbonate.

Mexican Pulque
Pulque recipe
Homebrewed Pulque
(5 gallons / 19 L)
OG = 1.055 FG = 1.010
IBU = 0 SRM = varies (depending on color of nectar) ABV = 4.25% (average)

Readers should keep in mind that it is difficult to replicate true pulque using only the ingredients in a home brewer’s pharmacopeia. It is common for pulque brewers in Mexico to reproduce their own strains of yeast, using a starter of fermented pulque (known as the "semilla", or seed) to ferment a fresh batch of agave nectar. These yeast strains, like many tricks of the trade, are closely guarded secrets amongst pulqueros — indeed, some of these strains of yeast may be as old as the Aztec Empire itself.

Ingredients
8.0 lbs. (3.6 kg) agave (maguey) nectar (Madhava brand agave nectar is available at Henry’s and other organic markets in light and dark versions. Either works.)
Wyeast 1056 (American Ale), White Labs WLP001 (California Ale) or Safale US-05 yeast  (Traditionally, a yeast strain known as Saccharomyces carbajali is commonly used.)

Step by Step 
Dissolve the agave nectar into the water, much as when making a mead. Heat for as long as it takes to dissolve nectar, but do not boil. After cooling wort, add the yeast (and bacteria, if using. See below). Ferment at 65 °F (18 °C). Fermentation time may vary. Best if served shortly after fermenting. If bottling, let cure in bottles for a few days, then keep refrigerated.

You can ferment the agave using only yeast; however, to replicate the sour flavor common in true pulque, I recommend adding a bacterial culture. You can use a commercially available lambic blend — such as Wyeast 3278 (Lambic Blend) or White Labs WLP655 (Belgian Sour Mix 1) — or a culture of Brettanomyces lambicus or Lactobacillus delbrueckii will also work.

Michael Pearson’s Standard American Lager
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.050 FG = 1.010
IBU = 18 SRM = 3 ABV = 5.3%

Scored a 47 at the Indiana Brewers Cup (1,071 entries)

Ingredients
4.5 lbs. (2.0 kg) Rahr 6-row pale malt
4.5 lbs. (2.0 kg) Rahr 2-row pale malt
12 oz. (0.34 kg) flaked maize
12 oz. (0.34 kg) flaked rice
5 AAU Magnum hops (60 min.) (0.42 oz./12 g of 12% alpha acids)
Wyeast 2112 (California Lager) yeast (2 qt./2 L starter)

Step by Step
Single Infusion mash at 150 °F (66 °C) for 60 minutes. Boil for 90 minutes. Cool. Oxygenate wort for 90 seconds. Pitch at 52 °F (11 °C) and let free rise to 55 °F (13 °C). Maintain at 55 °F (13 °C) for 14 days. Raise temperature to 62 °F (17 °C) for 7 day maturation rest. Wyeast 2112 doesn’t throw much diacetyl, so this step is to knock the subtle acetaldehyde down and expedite sulfur scrubbing by CO2. If filtering, transfer to Corny keg and crash cool for 2–4 days and filter using your normal method. If not, crash cool and lager for 10–14 days until desired clarity is reached and sulfur aroma/flavor from yeast in suspension is not detectable. [Original recipe was 7 gallons at 70% extract efficiency.]

Ingredients

3.33 lbs. (1.5 kg) Breiss Light dried malt extract
6.0 lbs. (2.7 kg) Coopers Light liquid malt extract
8.0 oz. (0.23 kg) dark crystal malt (130–150 °L)
6.0 oz. (0.17 kg) medium crystal malt (45–55 °L)
6.0 oz. (0.17 kg) roasted barley (400–500 °L)
6.0 oz. (0.17 kg) chocolate malt (300–400 °L)
16 oz. (0.45 kg) Weyermann Carafa III dehusked roasted malt (450–500 °L)
1 tsp. Irish moss
18.3 AAU Nugget hops (60 min) (1.5 oz./yy g of 15% alpha acid)
6 AAU Cascade hops (20 min) (1 oz./28 g of 6% alpha acid)
8 AAU Centennial hops (5 min) (1 oz./28 g of 8% alpha acid)
Wyeast 1056 or White Labs WLP001
3/4 cup corn sugar (for bottling)

Step by Step

Place crushed grains in a nylon steeping bag and heat 105 fl. oz. (3.1 L) of water to 162 °F (72 °F). Steep grains in this water for 45 minutes. The temperature should be around 150 °F (66 °C) for the
duration of the steep.

Combine 1.7 gallons (6.4 L) of water and dried malt extract (DME) with "grain tea" and heat to a boil. (To save time, heat water and DME while steeping the grains.) Boil wort for 60 minutes, adding Nugget hops at the beginning of the boil. With 20 minutes left in the boil, add the Cascade hops. With 15 minutes left, stir in the liquid malt extract (LME) and add Irish moss. Stir in LME thoroughly to prevent extract from sinking in kettle and scorching to the bottom. Add Centennial with hops with 5 minutes left in the boil.

After boil, cool wort down to 70 °F (21 °C), aerate, pitch yeast and ferment at 70 °F (21 °C). Rack after about 14 days and a second time in another 21 days. Then prime, bottle and hold for at least 14
days before drinking. This beer can be consumed young or can be laid down for aging.

All grain option:

An all-grain version of this beer can be made by substituting 14.25 lbs. (6.5 L) of 2-row pale malt for the liquid and dried malt extracts.

Step by Step
Mash at 148 °F (64 °C) for 60 minutes. Collect enough wort for a 3.5-hour boil adding hops in the final hour of the boil per the ingredients list. At the end of the boil, give the wort a long stir and let settle for 15 minutes. Cool, aerate heavily and transfer to the fermenter. Ferment at 68 °F(20 °C) until finished, then transfer the beer into a secondary vessel with the sanitized oak chips. You can sanitize the oak chips by boiling them in 1 cup water for 15 minutes or you can try soaking these in wine or a spirit of your choice. Midnight Sun will barrel age Arctic Devil for 10–12 months in American oak barrels of various origins. We recommend 1-2 months on the oak chips, tasting regularly until the desired level of oak flavor is achieved. Dry hop the beer for ten days, then bottle or keg. Carbonate to 2.4 volumes CO2.

Extract with grains option:
Substitute the Maris Otter pale malt in the all-grain recipe with 15 lbs. (6.8 kg) Maris Otter liquid malt extract. Place the crushed grains in a grain bag and steep in 5 gallons (19 L) water as it heats up to 170 °F (77 °C). Remove the grain bag and allow to drain back into the kettle. Bring to boil and boil for 60 minutes, adding the hops according to the ingredients list. Follow the remaining portion of the all-grain recipe.

Many consider Mike Riddle one of the best brewers of this style. He has won many best of show awards with this recipe.

Ingredients
8 lb. (3.63 kg) Maris Otter or similar pale English liquid malt extract
2.6 lb. (1.18 kg) wheat liquid malt extract (2 °L)
2.25 lb. (1 kg) Great Western chocolate malt (475 °L or similar)
2.25 lb. (1 kg) Great Western roasted barley (575 °L or similar)
0.75 lb. (340 g) Great Western crystal malt (120 °L or similar)

8.25 AAU Kent Goldings hops (1.65 oz./47 g at 5% alpha acids) (dry hop)
White Labs WLP004 (Irish Ale) or Wyeast 1084 (Irish Ale) yeast

Step by Step
Mill or coarsely crack the specialty malt and place loosely in a grain bag. Avoid packing the grains too tightly in the bag, using more bags if needed. Steep the bag in about 1.5 gallons (~6 liters) of water at roughly 170 °F (77 °C) for about 30 minutes. Lift the grain bag out of the steeping liquid and rinse with warm water. Allow the bags to drip into the kettle for a few minutes while you add the malt extract. Do not squeeze the bags. Add enough water to the steeping liquor and malt extract to make a pre-boil volume of 5.9 gallons (22.3 liters) and a gravity of 1.085 (20.5 °P). Stir thoroughly to help dissolve the extract and bring to a boil.

The total wort boil time is 60 minutes. Add the bittering hops as soon as the wort begins to boil. Add Irish moss or other kettle finings with 15 minutes left in the boil and the remaining hop additions according to the hops schedule. Chill the wort to 70 °F (21 °C) and aerate thoroughly. The proper pitch rate is 17 grams of properly rehydrated dry yeast, about 4 packages of liquid yeast, or 1 package of liquid yeast in a 6.3-liter starter.

Ferment at 70 °F (21 °C) until the yeast drops clear. Allow the lees to settle and the brew to mature without pressure for another two days after fermentation appears finished. Transfer to secondary and add dry hops. Allow it to finish fermenting until completely settled, about seven additional days. Rack to a keg and force carbonate or rack to a bottling bucket, add priming sugar, and bottle. Target a carbonation level of 2 to 2.5 volumes. Once carbonated, store the beer in a cool, dark place and allow to age. The beer will improve over time and should mature one to three years before drinking.

Step by Step
Mill the grains and dough-in targeting a mash thickness that will enable your system to achieve the necessary pre-boil volume and gravity. Hold the mash at 149 °F (65 °C) until enzymatic conversion is complete. Infuse the mash with near boiling water while stirring or with a recirculating mash system raise the temperature to mash out at 168 °F (76 °C). Sparge slowly with 170 °F (77 °C) water, collecting wort until the pre-boil kettle volume is around 6.5 gallons (25 L) and the gravity is 1.078 (18.8 °P). If your system loses efficiency on big beers, start with an additional 4 to 5 lbs. (2 kg) of base malt or make sure you have a couple of pounds (1 kg) or more of malt extract on hand to make up any deficiency in efficiency.

The total wort boil time is 90 minutes. Add the bittering hops with 60 minutes remaining in the boil. Add the other hop additions according to the schedule. Add Irish moss or other kettle finings with 15 minutes left in the boil. Chill the wort to 70 °F (21 °C) and aerate thoroughly. The proper pitch rate is 17 grams of properly rehydrated dry yeast, about 4 packages of liquid yeast, or 1 package of liquid yeast in a 6.3-liter starter.

Follow the remainder of the extract with grains recipe.

Step by Step
This is a single step infusion mash. Mix all of the crushed grains with 4.1 gallons (15.4 L) of 167 °F (75 °C) water to stabilize at 148 ºF (64 °C). This is a medium-thin mash using 1.4 quarts of strike water per pound of grain (2.9 L/kg). This ratio will help to maximize fermentability. A more fermentable wort is also created by the lower mash temperature. Mash for 60 minutes and slowly sparge with 170 ºF (77 ºC) water.

Collect approximately 6 gallons (23 L) of wort runoff and boil for 60 minutes. While boiling, add the hops, Irish moss and yeast nutrient as per the schedule. During the boil, use this time to thoroughly sanitize your fermentation equipment.
After the boil is complete, cool the wort to 75 ºF (24 ºC) and transfer to your fermenter. Pitch the yeast and aerate the wort heavily. Allow the beer to cool to 68 ºF (20 ºC). Hold at that tem-perature until fermentation is complete. Gently transfer to a carboy, avoiding any splashing to prevent aerating the beer. Allow the beer to condition for an additional week. Prime and bottle condition or keg and force carbonate to 2.4 volumes CO2. Allow the beer to age for at least two more weeks to fully develop the flavors and enjoy your Louie’s Demise

"When we made this beer it was summertime so we wanted something citrus and sessionable. The Ekuanot® hops are very citrus-forward with lemon and lime. We were using a pale ale base recipe for the sessionability. I chose the Ekuanot® hops because I tasted them at another local brewery in a S.M.A.S.H. (single malt and single hop) with Golden Promise. I liked that beer and wanted to experiment with the hop myself."— Michael Brown Assistant Brewer, Mirror Twin Brewing Co.

Ingredients
11 lbs. (5 kg) 2-row pale malt
12 oz. (340 g) caramel malt (20 °L)
5 AAU Ekuanot™ hops (45 min.) (0.33 oz./9 g at 15% alpha acids)
10 AAU Ekuanot™ hops (15 min.) (0.66 oz./19 g at 15% alpha acids)
22.5 AAU Ekuanot™ hops (0 min.) (1.5 oz./43 g at 15% alpha acids)
8 oz. (230 g) Ekuanot™ hops (dry hop)
White Labs WLP008 (East Coast Ale) or Wyeast 1028 (London Ale) or LalBrew New England yeast
3⁄4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
This recipe is designed for homebrewers to achieve 5.5 gallons (21 L) of wort in their fermenter on brew day. This will help offset the loss of volume to the heavy hopping rate of this beer.

Crush the malt and add to 4 gallons (15 L) of strike water to achieve a stable mash temperature at 150 °F (65.5 °C). After 60 minutes, begin to lauter.

Boil for 60 minutes, adding the first hop addition 15 minutes after the wort comes to a boil and a second hop addition with 15 minutes left in the boil. After the boil is complete, turn off the heat and add the final hop addition. stir the wort to create a whirlpool, then let settle for 20 minutes before cooling to yeast-pitching temperature. Aerate wort and pitch yeast.

Ferment at 68 °F (20 °C). As the kräusen begins to fall, typically day 4 or 5, add the dry hops. Let the beer sit on the hops for 3–4 days, then transfer to a serving keg or bottling bucket. You may want to cold-crash the beer prior to the transfer by dropping temperature of the beer to 35 °F (2 °C) for 24 hours. Bottle with priming sugar or force carbonate the serving keg to 2.4 volumes CO2.

Tips for success:

Michael Brown said that Mirror Twin used second generation White Labs WLP008 (East Coast Ale) yeast because it contributes citrus qualities, however he suggests that homebrewers can substitute in their favorite yeast strain that attenuates well and provides a citrus kick without overwhelming the hops. Further, Brown said, "Our recipe was very simple . . . (which) allowed the hops to shine. We also wanted to accentuate the citrus qualities and make this a thirst-quenching beer for summer, so we zested 35 lemons and put the zest in after fermentation was complete."

(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.050  FG = 1.012
IBU = 25  SRM = 23  ABV = 5%

Ingredients
7.5 lbs. (3.4 kg) British pale ale malt
1 lb. (0.45 kg) Munich malt
0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) caramel malt (60 °L)
0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) Fawcett brown malt
0.25 lb. (113 g) pale chocolate malt
0.25 lb. (113 g) roasted barley (500 °L)
6 oz. (170 g) crushed pecans (toasted)
Maple extract (to taste)
5.5 AAU Magnum hops (60 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 11% alpha acids)
2 AAU Fuggle hops (15 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 4% alpha acids)
0.5 oz. (14 g) Fuggle hops (0 min.)
Wyeast 1056 (American Ale) or White Labs WLP001 (California Ale) yeast
2/3 cup (133 g) dextrose (if priming)

Step by Step
Mill the grains, add the toasted pecans, and mix with 3.1 gallons (11.8 L) of 167 °F (75 °C) strike water to reach a mash temperature of 154 °F (68 °C). Hold this temperature for 60 minutes. Vorlauf until your runnings are clear and lauter. Sparge the grains with 3.8 gallons (14.4 L) of water and top up as necessary to obtain 6 gallons (23 L) of wort. Boil for 60 minutes, adding hops according to the ingredient list and Irish moss as desired. Chill to 66 °F (19 °C), aerate, and pitch yeast. Ferment at 68 °F (20 °C) for 14 days, or until fermentation is complete. Once the beer completes fermentation, add maple extract to taste (see Tips for Success), then bottle or keg the beer and carbonate to approximately 2.25 volumes. You may want to cold-crash the beer prior to packaging to 35 °F (2 °C) for 48 hours to improve clarity.

Extract with grains option:
Substitute the pale ale malt in the all-grain recipe with 5 lbs. (2.3 kg) pale liquid malt extract. Bring 5.4 gallons (20.4 L) of water to approximately 165 °F (74 °C) and hold there, steeping the toasted pecans and specialty malts in grain bags for 15 minutes. Remove the grain bags and let drain fully. Add malt extract while stirring, and stir until completely dissolved. Bring the wort to a boil for 60 minutes. Follow the remaining portion of the all-grain recipe.

Tips for Success:
Focus on dialing in the maple and pecan flavors in your finished beer. If either method (mashing for all-grain, steeping for extract) does not yield noticeable pecan character, try increasing the amount of pecan used, and/or adding a second charge of crushed/toasted pecans in the secondary. As for the maple extract — use it cautiously and taste as you add. It is a powerful flavor and a little goes a long way. Too much will dramatically increase the perception of sweetness, and we want to avoid that. This may call for a bit of trial and error! There are many maple extracts available and all are not created equally. For what it’s worth, The Mitten uses a maple extract from Beanilla, a local company out of Rockford, Michigan.

Monks’ Fortitude Märzen
Monks’ Fortitude Märzen
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.056 FG = 1.013
IBU = 24 SRM = 9 ABV = 5.7%

Monks’ Fortitude is an homage to the malty Märzens of Franconia. Located in scenic Franconian Switzerland, Klosterbrauerei Weissenohe was once a monastery with a turbulent history, dissolved twice over the centuries before falling into private hands. I’d like to think it was the beer the monks brewed that gave them the fortitude to endure those troubling times.

Ingredients
8.5 lbs. (3.9 kg) Vienna malt (3 ºL)
3 lbs. (1.4 kg) German dark Munich malt (10 ºL)
0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) CaraRed® malt (20 ºL)
4.8 AAU Hersbrucker hops (first wort hop) (1.6 oz./45 g at 3% alpha acids)
1.5 AAU Hersbrucker hops (30 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 3% alpha acids)
0.25 oz. (7 g) Hersbrucker hops (5 min.)
Yeast nutrients (10 min.)
Whirlfloc (10 min.)
White Labs WLP835 (German Lager X), Omega Yeast OYL-111 (German Bock), or Mangrove Jack’s M84 (Bohemian Lager) yeast
3⁄4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by step
If using liquid yeast, make a yeast starter two days prior to brew day. For your water, treat 10 gallons (38 L) of reverse osmosis water with 1⁄2 tsp. lactic acid for mash acidification, 1 g gypsum, 1 g Epsom salt, and 5 g calcium chloride.

Urban Winkler extols the virtues of a triple decoction mash as the old school way of achieving Märzen’s signature maltiness, but you can get away with a double or single decoction. You can also do a "hoch-kurz" step mash with or without a protein rest. Alternatively, perform a single-infusion mash at 152 °F (67 °C).

Mash in for a 10-minute protein rest at 131 °F (55 °C). Raise temperature to 145 °F (63 °C) and rest for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, pull your first decoction and let it rest at 145 °F (63 °C) for 20 minutes before boiling for 10 minutes. Add it back to the main mash to raise the temperature to 162 °F (72 °C) for a 30-minute rest. Pull a second decoction and boil 15 minutes before adding back to the main mash to bring it up to 169 °F (76 °C) for a 10-minute mash out.

Sparge to collect 6.75 gallons (25.5 L) of wort once your mash has reached conversion, adding first wort hops to the kettle while sparging. Boil for 75 minutes adding hops, nutrients, and kettle fining per schedule. After the boil, cool wort, pitch plenty of yeast, and aerate well if using a liquid yeast strain. Ferment between 46–48 °F (8–10 °C) until primary fermentation is finished (7–9 days), then lager for 4 weeks around 32 °F (0 °C).

Spunding is ideal when it comes to carbonation. Aim for 2.4 volumes of CO2. Bottle-conditioning also helps produce a rounder carbonation than forced carbonation. It’s common to filter Märzen or let it drop bright, but an increasing number of brewers are serving their Märzen unfiltered.

Extract with grains option: Substitute 3 lbs. (3.9 kg) each of Pilsen and Munich dried malt extracts for the Vienna and dark Munich malt. If using liquid yeast, make a yeast starter two days prior to brew day. For your water, treat 6 gallons (23 L) of reverse osmosis water with 1⁄4 tsp. lactic acid, 1⁄2 g Epsom salt, and 3 g calcium chloride.

Place crushed grains in a muslin bag and steep in the brewing water as the temperature rises to 170 °F (77 °C). Remove grains, allowing the liquid to drip back into the kettle. Remove from heat and stir in the malt extract. Once fully dissolved, add the first wort hops and bring the wort to a boil.

Boil for 60 minutes. Follow the fermentation, carbonation, and packaging suggestions from the all-grain recipe.

Jamil's Moonless Tropical Night
Moonless Tropical Night
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.071 (17.4 °P) FG = 1.017 (4.4 °P)
IBU = 45 SRM = 44 ABV = 7.6%

Ingredients
12.5 lb. (5.67 kg) British pale ale malt (3 °L)
0.75 lb. (340 g) black roasted barley (500 °L)
10 oz. (284 g) crystal malt (40 °L)
10 oz. (284 g) crystal malt (80 °L)
0.5 lb. (227 g) chocolate malt (420 °L)
12 AAU Kent Goldings hops (60 min.) (2.4 oz/68 g at 5% alpha acids)
1 tsp. Irish Moss
Wyeast 1028 (London Ale), White Labs WLP013 (London Ale) or Danstar Nottingham yeast
3/4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Mill the grains and dough-in targeting a mash of around 1.5 quarts (6 L) of water to 1 pound (0.5 kg) of grain (a liquor-to-grist ratio of about 3:1 by weight) and a temperature of 152 °F (67 °C). Hold the mash at 152 °F (67 °C) until the conversion is complete, about 60 minutes. Raise the temperature to mash out at 168 °F (76 °C). Sparge slowly with 170 °F (77 °C) water, collecting wort until the pre-boil kettle volume is around 6.5 gallons (25 L) and the gravity is 1.055 (13.5°P).

The total wort boil time is 90 minutes. Add the hops with 60 minutes remaining in the boil. Add Irish moss or other kettle finings with 15 minutes left in the boil. Chill the wort rapidly to 67 °F (19 °C), let the break material settle, rack to the fermenter and aerate thoroughly.

Pitch 12 grams (0.4 oz.) of properly rehydrated dry yeast or use two liquid yeast packages. Alternatively, make a three-liter (3-qt.) starter using one package of liquid yeast. Ferment at 67 °F (19 °C), raising the temperature to 70 °F (21 °C) during the last 1⁄3 of fermentation to help reduce diacetyl and assure complete attenuation. Allow the lees to settle and the brew to mature without pressure for another two days after fermentation appears finished.

Rack to a keg and force carbonate or rack to a bottling bucket, add priming sugar, and bottle. Target a carbonation level of two to two and a half volumes.

OG = 1.071 (17.4 °P) FG = 1.017 (4.4 °P)
IBU = 45 SRM = 44 ABV = 7.6%

Ingredients
6.6 lb. (3 kg) Maris Otter liquid malt extract (3.5 °L)
1.5 lbs. (0.68 kg) light dried malt extract (3.5 °L)
0.75 lb. (340 g) black roasted barley (500 °L)
10 oz. (284 g) crystal malt (40 °L)
10 oz. (284 g) crystal malt (80 °L)
0.5 lb. (227 g) chocolate malt (420 °L)
12 AAU Kent Goldings hops (60 min.) (2.4 oz/68 g at 5% alpha acids)
White Labs WLP013 (London Ale), Wyeast 1028 (London Ale) or Danstar Nottingham yeast
3/4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Mill or coarsely crack the specialty malts. Mix them well and place loosely in a grain bag. Avoid packing the grains too tightly in the bag, using more bags if needed. Steep the bag in about two gallons (~8 liters) of water at roughly 170 °F (77 °C) for about 30 minutes.

Lift the grain bag out of the steeping liquid and rinse with warm water. Allow the bags to drip into the kettle for a few minutes while you add the malt extract. Do not squeeze the steeping bags. Add enough water to the steeping liquor and malt extract to make a pre-boil volume of 5.9 gallons (22.3 L) and a gravity of 1.061 (14.9 °P). Stir thoroughly to help dissolve the extract and bring the liquid to a boil. Once the wort is boiling, add the bittering hops. The total wort boil time is one hour after adding the bittering hops. Add Irish moss or other kettle finings at 15 minutes.

Chill the wort to 67 °F (19 °C). Aerate thoroughly and pitch 12 grams of properly rehydrated dry yeast or use two liquid yeast packages. Alternatively, make a three-liter (3-qt.) starter using one package of liquid yeast. Follow fermentation and packaging instructions for the all-grain version.

After 15 minutes (yeast should begin to foam), stir well to mix the yeast into a slurry. Pour the yeast slurry into the fermenter. Seal fermenter with a sanitized airlock and put fermenter in an area that is 65 °F (18 °C).

When fermentation stops and the specific gravity as measured by a hydrometer is stable (has not changed over the course of several days), it is ready to transfer the cider into a secondary fermenter. Sanitize your secondary fermenter and siphoning equipment. Carefully siphon the fruited cider into the secondary fermenter. Leave as much sediment as possible in the primary fermenter. Let the cider clarify in the secondary fermenter. You may wish to add a fining agent such as isinglass to facilitate clearing, and/or potassium sorbate to prevent further fermentation.

At this point in the process you’re going to want to taste your cider and see what final adjustments need to be made. This is where your skills really will shine as you need to balance the acidity, and sweetness.

I recommend using sanitized siphoning equipment to pull a small amount of cider to sample, and if needed, then back sweeten to taste and stabilize. Options for back sweeting are limitless — you could use fruit juice, sugar, honey, etc. The challenge is not to ruin what you have worked so hard at. The fermentation process causes particular matter to drop, and when you rack off the sediment it results in your clear finished product. If you were to add juice to back sweeten, you should expect that this will leave some sediment in the fruited cider. However, you can get a rather amazing fruit note by adding juice to the finished fruited cider.

If you wish to bottle condition your stabilized cider, wait 24 hours and then add priming sugar. Use a bottle-conditioning calculator to get the right carbonation level. Bottle conditioning will produce a dry cider and cannot be used if sorbate has been added to stabilize a sweet cider.

You can bottle or keg your fruited cider the same way you would your homebrew. Hard fruit ciders can be consumed after two weeks of bottling and aged for six months or more to achieve superior flavor.

Mountain Brew
(5 gallons/19 L, extract only)
OG = 1.046 FG = 1.006
IBU = 19 SRM = 4 ABV = 5.2%

Ingredients
4.0 lbs. (1.8 kg) Muntons Extra Light dried malt extract
2.3 gallons (8.7 L) Mountain Dew (24 12-oz. cans of the soda)
4.5 AAU Northern Brewer hops (45 mins) (0.5 oz./14 g of 9% alpha acids)
2.25 AAU Northern Brewer hops (15 mins) (0.25 oz./7 g of 9% alpha acids)
1/2 tsp Irish moss
1/4 tsp yeast nutrients
Danstar Manchester yeast
1.0 cup corn sugar (for priming)

Step by step
Pour Mountain Dew into a clean, sanitized brew bucket. (The soda should not have anything growing in it, so there’s no need to boil. You may want to wipe the lips of the cans with a paper towel soaked in sanitizing solution, though. Let it sit in the bucket (covered) as you boil the wort so the level of carbonation will decrease.) Bring 2.5 gallons (9.5 L) of water to a boil and stir in malt extract. Boil for 60 minutes, adding hops at the times indicated in the recipe. Add Irish moss with 15 minutes left in the boil. Cool wort and pour into Mountain Brew. (Watch for excessive foaming.) Top up to 5 gallons (19 L) with water. Aerate (again, watching for excessive foaming) and pitch yeast. Ferment at 68 °F (20 °C) for 1 week. Rack to secondary and age for 2 weeks, Bottle with corn sugar.

All-grain option:
Next time you make a light all-grain beer, such as a Kölsch, cream ale or light pale ale, make an extra 2.5 gallons (9.5 L) of wort. Combine 2.5 gallons (9.5 L) cooled wort with Mt. Dew and water to make 5 gallons (19 L).

Mozzarella
Mozzarella

Ingredients:

1 gallon (3.8 L) of whole, low-fat or skim milk (not ultra pasteurized)
1 1/2 tsp. citric acid
1/4 – 1/2 rennet tablet or 1/4 tsp. liquid rennet
1 1/4 cup water (cool, non-chlorinated)
salt
icewater bath
Step by Step:

Once you have all your materials together, start by dissolving the
rennet tablet in 1/4 cup of the water (if you started from dry
ingredients).

Dissolve the citric acid in the remaining cup of water.

Pour the milk into the large stock pot and add the dissolved citric acid. Stir well.

Put the pot of milk on the stove and heat the milk to 90 °F (32 °C).
Continue to stir as the milk heats. When the milk reaches 90 °F (32
°C), take the pot off the stove and very gently stir in the rennet in
an up-down motion for 15 seconds. It is crucial to the curd that you
don’t over stir during this step as you may inadvertently cut the curd
with your spoon, which can prevent your initial curd from setting up
properly. Cover the pot and allow it to sit very still for about five
minutes.

After five minutes have passed, remove the lid and check on the cheese
curd. The curd should have set up in a solid, custard-like mass in the
pot and you should be able to see a clear separation between the curd
and the whey around the edge of the pot. You can put your spoon into
the pot in between the edge of the pot and the curd and pull the curd
away. If the curd hasn’t set up firmly, cover the pot again and let it
sit for up to 15 minutes. If the curd still doesn’t set up, try heating
the milk to 95 or 100 °F (35 or 38 °C). If the curd is still not
setting up properly (ie: grainy and looks like ricotta), your milk may
have been pasteurized at a high heat and the proteins will not form a
curd. (If this happens, see the section on troubleshooting on page 38.)

Assuming your curd set up properly, the next step is cutting the curd.
Take your knife and cut the curd in a checkerboard pattern from top to
bottom and side-to-side, making cubes of about 3⁄8 of an inch. The curd
should resemble a firm yogurt.

Once you’ve cut the curd, put the pot back on the heat, warm the curds
and whey up to 110 °F (43 °C) and remove from the heat again and gently
stir the curds for two to five minutes. This allows the curd to firm up
a little bit more. The longer you stir, the firmer the finished cheese.

Now ladle your curds into the strainer to separate them from the whey.
If you have a purpose for using the whey, such as making a batch of
ricotta, reserve it to the side and store for another time. Otherwise
discard the whey.

In the smaller sauce pan, heat a few quarts of water to 185 °F (85 °C).
You may salt the water if you would like your finished cheese to be a
little salty. Dip the colander of curds into the hot water bath,
heating them up to about 135 °F (57 °C) or until they become gooey and
stretchable. If you have a pair of rubber gloves, this is a good time
to put them on as you will be working the hot curds with your hands.

When the curds get stretchy, start out by kneading them like a piece of
bread dough on a clean surface, working gently at first. When the curd
cools down and becomes less pliable, put it back in the colander and
dip it in the water bath again. After a few cycles, you will see the
cheese starting to get smooth and shiny. Drain off the whey as you work
the cheese. At this point you can start stretching it like taffy
instead of kneading. Alternately stretch the cheese and bring it back
together until it becomes white and shiny, dipping back in the hot
water bath as needed. You can add salt during the stretching process,
as well as herbs or spices, if desired.

When you achieve a good stretchiness and a shiny look, form the
mozzarella into a ball and plunge it into a cold water bath to cool and
set for about ten minutes

Ingredients
3.3 lbs. (1.5 kg) Coopers Light, unhopped malt extract
2 lbs. (0.9 kg) light dried malt extract
0.6 lb. (0.27 kg) Munich malt
0.6 lb. (0.27 kg) crystal malt (15 °L)
0.6 lb. (0.27 kg) crystal malt (40 °L)
0.6 lb. (0.27 kg) crystal malt (70 °L)
6.5 AAU Chinook pellet hops (60 min.) (0.5 oz./ 14 g of 13% alpha acids)
1.4 AAU Cascade pellet hops (60 min.) (0.25 oz./ 7 g of 5.5% alpha acids)
3.9 AAU Chinook pellet hops (30 min.) (0.3 oz./ 8.5 g of 13% alpha acids)
1.1 AAU Cascade pellet hops (30 min.) (0.2 oz./ 5.7 g of 5.5% alpha acids)
1 oz. (28 g) Cascade whole leaf hops (dry hop)
1⁄2 tsp. Irish moss (15 mins.)
White Labs WLP001 (American Ale) or Wyeast 1056 (American Ale) or Safale US-05 yeast
0.75 cup (150 g) corn sugar (for priming)

Step by Step
Steep the crushed grain in 2 gallons (7.6 L) of water at 150 ºF (65.5 ºC) for 30 minutes. Remove grains from the wort and rinse with 2 quarts (1.8 L) of hot water. Add the liquid and dried malt extracts and bring to a boil. Add the hops and Irish moss as per the schedule. Add the wort to 2 gallons (7.6 L) of cold water in the sanitized fermenter and top off with cold water up to 5 gallons (19 L).
Cool the wort to 75 ºF (24 ºC). Pitch your yeast and aerate the wort heavily. Allow the beer to cool to 70 ºF (21 ºC) and hold it there until fermentation is complete. Transfer to a carboy, avoiding any splashing. Add the dry hops and let the beer condition for one week. Strain the dry hops and then bottle or keg. Allow to carbonate and age for two weeks.

All-grain option: This is a single step infusion mash. Replace the malt syrup with 8.5 lbs. (3.9 kg) 2-row pale malt. Mix the crushed grains with 3.5 gallons (13.2 L) of 168 °F (75.5 °C) water to stabilize at 150 ºF (65.5 ºC) for 60 minutes. Sparge slowly with 175 ºF (79 ºC) water. Collect approximately 6 gallons (23 L) of wort runoff to boil for 60 minutes. Reduce the 60 minute hop additions to 0.4 oz. (11 g) Chinook and 0.2 oz. (5.6 g) Cascade to allow for the higher utilization factor of a full wort boil. The remainder of this recipe and procedures are the same as the extract with grain recipe.
Note: A thin mash is recommended by the brewer (1.5 quarts/1.4 L) strike water for each pound of grain).

Saflager W-34/70 or Wyeast 2124 (Bohemian Lager) or White Labs WLP830 (German Lager) yeast
3⁄4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step

This recipe uses a multi-step infusion mash. Dough in at around 104 °F (40 °C) for a hydration rest of 15 minutes. Raise the temperature to 122 °F (50 °C) for a protein rest of 15 minutes. Raise the temperature to 149 °F (65 °C) for a beta amylase rest of 30 minutes. Raise the temperature to 162 °F (72 °C) for an alpha amylase rest of 30 minutes. Raise temperature to 169 °F (76 °C) for the mash-out. Recirculate wort then begin sparge.

Boil for 75 minutes, adding hops as indicated. At the end of the boil, turn off heat and whirlpool for 15 minutes. Heat-exchange to the high end of the temperature range for the selected yeast. As soon as primary fermentation is vigorous, reduce the tank temperature to the low end of the yeast’s temperature range. After 7 additional days, give the beer a diacetyl rest by raising the tank temperature to 66 °F (19 °C) and hold it there for about 2 days. Rack and reduce the beer temperature for lagering by 2 °F (1 °C ) a day until reaching 31 °F (–1 °C) or close to it, equipment permitting. Lager for

4 to 6 weeks. Some brewers may shorten the lagering time to 2 to 4 weeks, others will lengthen it to 12 weeks. Rack again. Carbonate to approximately 2.6 volumes of CO2.

OG = 1.040 (10 °P) FG = 1.010 (2.5 °P)
IBU = 38 SRM = 33 ABV = 4%

Ingredients

6 lb. (2.72 kg) British pale ale malt
1.75 lb. (794 g) flaked barley
14 oz. (397 g) roasted barley (500 °L)
7.75 AAU Kent Golding pellet hops (60 min.) (1.75 oz./50 g at 5% alpha acids)
White Labs WLP007 (Dry English), Wyeast 1098 (British Ale) or Danstar Nottingham yeast
1/3 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step

I use Crisp Malting's British Pale Ale malt (made from Maris Otter) as my base grain, but other malts of a similar nature should work well. The roasted barley and flaked barley I use is from Great Western Malting Co. Feel free to substitute any high quality product of a similar flavor and color from a different supplier.

In this recipe the roasted barley is milled normally along with the other grains. Dough-in targeting a mash of around 1.5 quarts of water to 1 pound of grain (a liquor-to-grist ratio of about 3:1 by weight or 3.1 L/kg) and a temperature of 152 °F (67 °C). Hold the mash at 152 °F (67 °C) until enzymatic conversion is complete. Infuse the mash with near boiling water while stirring or with a recirculating mash system raise the temperature to mash out at 168 °F (76 °C). Sparge slowly with 170 °F (77 °C) water, collecting wort until the pre-boil kettle volume is around 6.5 gallons (24.4 L) and the gravity is 1.031 (7.8 °P).

The total wort boil time is 90 minutes. Add the bittering hops with 60 minutes remaining in the boil. Add Irish moss or other kettle finings with 15 minutes left in the boil. Chill the wort rapidly to 69 °F (21 °C), let the break material settle, rack to the fermenter, pitch the yeast and aerate thoroughly.

Ferment at 69 °F (21 °C). Slowly raise the temperature during the final 1⁄3 of fermentation by 6 °F (3 °C) to reduce diacetyl levels in the beer. When finished, carbonate the beer to approximately 1 to 1.5 volumes and serve at 52 to 55 °F (11 to 13 °C).

Berith Karlsson, from Närke Kulturbryggeri, said of this smoked doppelbock spiced with juniper twigs, "being a double bock lager, (it) is named after the two goats pulling the wagon of Thor, the god of thunder."

Ingredients
7 lbs. (3.2 kg) smoked malt (Gotland, Viking or Weyermann)
4.5 lbs. (2 kg) Munich malt
1 lb. (0.45 kg) Carapils® malt
1 lb. (0.45 kg) wheat malt
13 oz. (0.36 kg) sucrose (15 min.)
7.5 AAU Northern Brewer hops (60 min.) (1 oz./28 g at 7.5% alpha acids)
4.3 AAU Hallertau Mittelfruh hops (1 min.) (1.3 oz./38 g at 4.25% alpha acids)
4 twigs female (with berries) juniper
White Labs WLP833 (German Bock Lager) or Wyeast 2206 (Bavarian Lager) yeast
2/3 cup (133 g) dextrose (if priming)

Step by Step
Submerge the juniper twigs in about 7 gallons (26.5 L) of water and bring to a boil for 5 minutes. Remove twigs and use the water for mashing and sparging. Mash the grains at 151 °F (66 °C) for 60 minutes. Mash out, vorlauf, and then sparge at 170 °F (77 °C) to collect 6 gallons (23 L) of wort. Boil for 60 minutes, adding hops and sucrose at times indicated. Cool, aerate, and pitch yeast at 60°F (16 °C). Hold until visible signs of fermentation, then slowly chill to 50°F (10 °C) and hold for the remainder of fermentation. After fermentation is complete, allow temperature to rise to 55°F (13 °C) for two days. Then cool to 33 °F (1 °C) at least 4 weeks. Bottle or keg as normal.

Partial mash option:
Substitute the smoked malt and Munich malt in the all-grain recipe with 5.5 lbs. (2.5 kg) Weyermann smoked malt extract and 2.75 lbs. (1.25 kg) liquid Munich malt extract. Place 4 qts. (4 L) of water in your brewpot. Toss in the juniper twigs, bring to a boil and boil for 5 minutes. Remove twigs and cool juniper water to 162 °F (72 °C). Place crushed grains in a large steeping bag and mash in juniper water at 151 °F (66 °C) for 45 minutes. Remove bag and rinse with 2 qts. (2 L) of 170 °F (77 °C) water. Top up to 6 gallons (23 L), add malt extracts, and bring to a boil for 60 minutes. Follow the remaining portion of the all-grain recipe.

A traditional German wheat bock with a twist. Breaking from tradition, Neshaminy Creek adds orange blossom honey to add orange background notes.

Ingredients
5.5 lbs. (2.5 kg) 2-row pale malt
4 lbs. (1.8 kg) dark Munich malt (10 °L)
4 lbs. (1.8 kg) red wheat malt
1 lb. (0.45 kg) caramel Pils/dextrine malt
0.75 lb. (0.34 kg) crystal malt (60 °L)
0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) chocolate malt (350 °L)
0.25 lb. (0.12 kg) crystal malt (80 °L)
0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) orange blossom honey (60 min.)
5.6 AAU Hallertau hops (45 min.) (1.25 oz./35 g at 4.5% alpha acids)
3.4 AAU Tettnang hops (15 min.) (0.75 oz./21 g at 4.5% alpha acids)
White Labs WLP300 (Hefeweizen Ale) or Wyeast 3068 (Weihenstephan Weizen) yeast
1 cup (200 g) dextrose (if priming)

Step by Step
Mill the grains and mix with 4.8 gallons (18.1 L) of 168 °F (75 °C) strike water to reach a mash temperature of 156 °F (69 °C). Hold this temperature for 60 minutes. Vorlauf until your runnings are clear and lauter. Sparge the grains with 3.3 gallons (12.5 L) water, add honey and stir until dissolved, and top up as necessary to obtain 6 gallons (23L) of wort. Boil for 75 minutes, adding hops according to the ingredient list. Chill the wort to 63 °F (17 °C), aerate, and pitch yeast. Ferment at 63 °F (17 °C) for 3 days. Raise to 68 °F (20 °C) for seven more days, or until you reach terminal gravity. Then increase to 70 °F (21 °C) and hold for three days for the diacetyl rest before bottling or kegging. Carbonate to approximately 3 volumes. You may want to cold-crash the beer prior to packaging to 35 °F (2 °C) for 48 hours to improve clarity.

Extract with grains option:
Reduce the caramel Pils/dextrine malt in the all-grain recipe 8 oz. (0.23 kg) and replace the 2-row pale malt, dark Munich malt, and red wheat malt with 2 lbs. (0.91 kg) extra light dried malt extract, 3.3 lbs. (1.5 kg) Munich liquid malt extract, and 3.3 lbs. (1.5 kg) wheat liquid malt extract. Bring 5.3 gallons (20.1 L) of water to approximately 162 °F (72 °C) and steep grains for 15 minutes. Remove the grain bags and let drain fully. Add liquid malt extract and honey off-heat and stir until completely dissolved. Top up as necessary to obtain 6 gallons (23 L) of wort. Follow the remaining portion of the all-grain recipe.

¾ cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Bring 2.3 gallons (8.8 L) of water to roughly 166 °F (74 °C). Steep the milled malts in a nylon bag for 45 minutes before removing and allowing the bag to drain. Add enough water to bring the total volume to 6.5 gallons (24.6 L) before adding the dried malt extract. Add extract while stirring. Once fully dissolved, heat wort to a boil. Boil for 60 minutes, adding hops at the indicated times left in the boil. At 15 minutes left in the boil, add a kettle fining agent of your choice.

After the boil, rapidly chill the wort to slightly below fermentation temperature, which is 52 °F (11 °C) for this beer. Pitch yeast and aerate well. Ferment cold for about 36 to 48 hours, ramping to 65 °F (18 °C) once the beer is about two thirds of the way through fermentation, about an SG of 1.034 (8.5 °Plato). Hold this temperature until terminal gravity is reached. Cold crash to 35 °F (2 °C) before transferring to lagering vessel for approximately one month. Bottle or keg the beer and carbonate to approximately 2.5 volumes.

Tips for Success:
Croydon is Burning uses traditional German malts including lots of rauch malt. Fear not extract brewers because you can easily perform a partial mash using a medium-sized nylon bag to harness the unique, complex character that comes from rauch malt. Currently, there’s no commercial extract versions of the malt and liquid smoke will give you only a shadow of the actual beer.

The second tip is to remember that rauchbiers are lagers; you can’t rush them. "Be patient, and let the yeast do the work," as Jeremy mentioned to me. NCBC has been able to go from grain to glass in 42 days but there’s no rush. A strong, healthy pitch for a lager and the use of pure oxygen for aeration will go a long way to ensure a fermentation without faults.

Tips for Success:
Co-Founder and Brewmaster (and multiple time Great American Beer Festival medal winner) Jeremy Myers offers two choices on yeast for this recipe. At Neshaminy Creek Brewing Company, in Croydon, Pennsylvania, they prefer the British yeast, pairing its esters with the coffee, but for those who prefer a cleaner chocolate-coffee flavor the American ale approach also produces a great beer. Expect discrepancies in the final gravity though, as the attenuation range between these two strains is fairly significant.

The gang sourced their chocolate from a local chocolatier (Pierre’s of New Home, Pennsylvania) who infused Colombian coffee (single-sourced, just like that used in the beer) into their house dark chocolate. Your commitment doesn’t need to be as high, and you can sub in any high-quality dark chocolate, but feel free to get creative!

(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.062 FG = 1.015 (or lower)
IBU = 20 SRM = 17 ABV = 6%

Ingredients
9.75 lbs. (4.4 kg) 2-row pale malt
1 lb. 5 oz. (0.60 kg) Munich malt
1 lb. 5 oz. (0.60 kg) crystal malt (60 °L)
10 oz. (0.28 kg) unmalted wheat
5.7 AAU Cantillion Iris hops (60 min.) (or any neutral hop) (1.9 oz./54 g at 3% alpha acids)
Wyeast 1056 (American Ale), White Labs WLP001 (California Ale), Fermentis Safale US-05 or Danstar Nottingham yeast
Wyeast 3278 (Lambic blend) or White Labs WLP655 (Belgian Sour Mix 1) blend
1 cup corn sugar (for priming)

Step by Step
Mash at 154 °F (68 °C). Boil for 60 minutes adding hops at the beginning of the boil. Ferment with neutral ale yeast at 75 °F (24 °C), then rack to barrel and add sour blend. Aging time is totally up to the barrel. This is where years of tasting and blending come in handy. If you want to blend, try ~ 20% of a sweeter (younger) barrel, ~30% of a nice mild sour barrel and ~50% of a well established "tour gripper" with nice oak notes (cherries, horse blanket, etc). (Young usually means ~ 1 year, mid range ~2 years and grippers are 3+ years.) But there are no rules here. Do whatever works for you.

Extract Option:
Omit 2-row pale malt. Add 1 lb. 14 oz. (0.85 kg) dried malt extract and 4 lb. 10 oz. (2.1 kg) liquid malt extract. Steep crushed Munich, crystal, and unmalted wheat in 4.8 qts. (4.6 L) of water at 154 °F (68 °C) for 45 minutes. Rinse with 2.4 qts. (2.3 L) of water at 170 °F (77 °C). Add water to make 3 gallons (11 L), add dried malt extract and bring to a boil. Add hops and boil for 60 minutes, stirring in LME at end of boil.

Poor Man's Barrel Option:
Don’t have the budget (or room) for a barrel? Try this "poor man’s" method of emulating some of the aspects of barrel aging. Conduct your primary fermentation in a bucket or ferment the beer with ale yeast, then rack it to a bucket — adding any "bugs" that may be called for. Buckets are more permeable to oxygen than barrels are, so let the beer condition in the bucket for only about 3 months, then rack it to a carboy for the remaining conditioning time. Two weeks before racking, take 3.0 oz. (85 g) of oak cubes (French oak, medium toast) and soak them in wine. Use Chardonnay for the Temptation clone, Pinot Noir for La Roja, Cabernet Sauvignon for Darth Porter and Burgundy or Meritage for Grand Cru and La Folie. Change wine every 3 days to lessen the intensity of the new oak. Add cubes when beer is racked to carboy.

Mill the grains and dough-in, targeting a mash of around 1.3 quarts of water to 1 pound of grain (2.7 L/kg) and a temperature of 150 °F (66 °C). Hold the mash at 150 °F (66 °C) until enzymatic conversion is complete, about 60 minutes. Sparge slowly with 170 °F (77 °C) water, collecting wort until the pre-boil kettle volume is 6 gallons (23 L). Add the first wort hops early in the sparge phase. Boil time is 60 minutes. Add flameout hops and spicing then start a whirlpool by stirring wort for at least a minute, and then let settle. After 30 minutes, chill the wort to 70 °F (18 °C) and aerate thoroughly. After 3 days, allow the fermentation temperature to rise up to 83 °F (29 °C). After primary fermentation is complete, transfer to a long-term aging vessel and pitch your Brettanomyces bruxellensis yeast. Anchorage Brewing Co. ages Love Buzz for eight months in French oak barrels that previously contained Pinot Noir wine. There are several alternatives. First, you can try to soak oak staves or cubes for several weeks in a sealed bottle of Pinot Noir (warning: the resulting wine will probably taste more like plywood than wine). Or you can boil the oak then add that along with several ounces of Pinot Noir directly to the beer. Age until the oak presence is detectable, but you don’t want it to overwhelm the beer. Try to taste once a week until this nuance is achieved. At that point, rack the beer off the oak and add your dry hops. Dry hop for 1–3 weeks, then either bottle or keg. Aim to carbonate the beer to around 2.8 volumes of CO2. If your Love Buzz clone was aging for more than 3 months and you plan on bottle conditioning, we recommend pitching either a neutral wine yeast or brewer’s yeast such as Lallemand’s CBC-1.

Extract with grains option:
Replace the grains in the all-grain recipe with 4 lbs. (1.8 kg) wheat dried malt extract, 2 lbs. (0.91 kg) Pilsen dried malt extract, and 8 oz. (0.23 kg) crystal malt (60 °L). Place your crushed grains in a grain bag and place in 6 gallons (23 L) of water in your kettle. Heat until temperature reaches 170 °F (77 °C), then remove the grain bag and add the first wort hops. When the water comes to a boil, remove from heat and add the dried malt extracts and stir thoroughly to dissolve and then return to a boil for 60 minutes. Follow the remaining portion of the all-grain recipe.

Tips for Success:
Unless you invest in oak barrels and don’t mind transferring the beer back and forth, the nuances of Love Buzz are going to be difficult to achieve at home. You could try to add the oak when you pitch the saison yeast instead of at the time of pitching the Brett B, since this may better simulate the oak-barrel fermentation that Love Buzz undergoes. But this may be a challenge if you need to transfer the beer into another vessel for secondary fermentation. A conical fermenter allowing for a yeast dump would be helpful in this situation. Otherwise, save the oak for secondary fermentation. Also if you are having trouble acquiring the suggested saison blends, you can try making your own blend based on the strains more widely available. There are several strains now commercially available of Brettanomyces bruxellensis. Finding the strain that is most appealing to you would be ideal. You could utilize dregs of a favorite beer, but Gabe states that Anchorage Brewing Co. pitches a neutral wine yeast strain at the time of bottling, so using the dregs from a bottle of their beer most likely will not get you the results you are after.

This recipe calls for fresh rose hips. We would recommend that you first smash the fruit, then freeze the rose hips in order to help open the fruit up. If fresh rose hip is not available, dried rose hips can be substituted. Cut the quantity by 1⁄4 if you plan to use dried rose hips.

OG* = 1.046 FG = 1.000
ABV = 5.5% IBU = ~30 SRM* = 3

Both the original gravity and SRM are numbers provided pre-grape addition. If you want to check the actual starting gravity, take a gravity reading from the fermenter after the grapes and wort have had time to incorporate, but prior to the onset of primary fermentation

Ingredients
9 lbs. (4.1 kg) Pilsner malt
1 gallon (4 L) Niagara grape must
1 oz. (28 g) Cascade hops (0 min.)
2 oz. (57 g) LemondropTM hops (whirlpool)
4 oz. (113 g) GalaxyTM hops (dry hop)
2 oz. (57 g) LemondropTM hops (dry hop)
Amylo enzyme (dosage rate per manufacturer’s instructions)
Lalvin EC-1118 or Red Star Premier Cuvée or Wyeast 4021 (Dry White/Sparking) yeast
7⁄8 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Mash at 145 °F (63 °C) for 60 minutes, adding the Amylo enzyme at the start of the mash. After 60 minutes perform a starch conversion test. You may want to raise the mash temperature up to 158 °F (70 °C) for 15 minutes to make sure the enzymes finish their job. Sparge with enough water to collect roughly 5.5 gallons (21 L) of wort in the kettle. Boil for 60 minutes.

Add grape must (crushed grapes) to fermenter before transferring wort. Add the last hop addition at the end of the boil and whirlpool for 15 minutes prior to cooling to fermentation temperature. Chill wort then transfer onto the grape must. Pitch yeast and aerate well. Ferment at 74–78 °F (23–26 °C) until gravity is stable. Upon hitting terminal gravity, age for an additional two weeks before packaging. Due to the large amount of particulate found in must, transferring to a secondary vessel for the final two weeks of aging may be helpful for achieving clarity.

Add grape must (crushed grapes) to fermenter before transferring wort. Add the last hop addition at the end of the boil and whirlpool for 15 minutes prior to cooling to fermentation temperature.

Chill wort then transfer wort onto the grape must. Pitch yeast and aerate well. Ferment at 74–78 °F (23–26 °C) until gravity is stable. Upon hitting terminal gravity, age for an additional two weeks before packaging. Due to the large amount of particulate found in must, transferring to a secondary vessel for the final two weeks of aging may be helpful for achieving clarity.

Tips for success:
You have the option of adding the Amylo in the mash, boil, or in the fermenter. Newburgh Head Brewer Basso says, "If you want it very dry I suggest use in the mash. If you want it completely dry with zero residual sugars then I think using in the fermenter would be best. We actually use it in the mash for a very dry result, but we think it’s a better beer than if it went to 0 °Plato."

Chris Basso, the Head Brewer and Co-Owner of Newburgh Brewing Company, in Newburgh, New York made his way into craft beer from the world of fine dining as a graduate of the Culinary Institute of America. Food has therefore always informed the brewery’s identity. Many of the recipes Chris has developed for Newburgh are born with a food pairing in mind or are explicitly inspired by a specific food. The inspiration for this Cherry Chocolate Cake stout — a collaboration with Fruition Chocolate Works — is of course no mystery, though it’s a wonder that cherries and chocolate are not even more common in the world of dark beers, being that they make for such a naturally complementary pair. Pastry stouts with extreme adjunct flavors are now all the rage, but Newburgh’s take on the dessert stout concept is a bit more refined, turning a few flavor dials up enough to make this a memorable concoction without getting lost in excessive indulgence.

Newcastle Brown Ale clone
Scottish and Newcastle Brewing Company's Newcastle Brown Ale clone
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.046 FG = 1.009
IBU = 22 SRM = 17 ABV = 4.7%

Newcastle Brown Ale is actually a blend of two beers. Brewers blend a strong, dark ale that has been aged and a smaller, younger amber ale. As a consequence, this average-strength brown ale shows some plum and raisin characteristics more frequently encountered in an old ale. You can try to make the blended version and those instructions can be found in the May/June 2006 issue. Here is a more simplified single batch version.

Ingredients
7.5 lbs. (3.4 kg) British 2-row pale ale malt
1 lb. (0.45 kg) flaked barley
4 oz. (113 g) caramalt (22 °L)
4 oz. (113 g) British medium crystal malt (55 °L)
4 oz. (113 g) British dark crystal malt (80 °L)
1.5 oz. (43 g) British chocolate malt (450 °L)
1.5 oz. (43 g) roasted barley (500 °L)
1/2 tsp. Irish moss (15 min.)
1/2 tsp. yeast nutrients (15 min.)
6.25 AAU Fuggle hops (60 min.) (1.25 oz./35 g at 5% alpha acids)
Wyeast 1099 (Whitbread ale) or White Labs WLP017 (Whitbread Ale) or Mangrove Jack's M15 (Empire Ale) yeast
3/4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Heat 12 quarts (11.4 L) of water to 163 °F (73 °C). Mash grains at 152 °F (67 °C) for 60 minutes. Collect 6.5 gallons (24.6 L) of wort. Boil wort for 90 minutes, adding hops and kettle additions at the times indicated in ingredients list. The goal is to have 5.25 gallons (20 L) at the end of the boil. Cool, aerate, and pitch yeast. Ferment at 70 °F (21 °C). Rack to secondary and let condition in a cool place.

Partial mash option: Reduce the 2-row pale malt in the all-grain recipe to 1 lb. (0.45 kg). Replace with 1 lb. (0.45 kg) extra light dried malt extract and 3.3 lbs. (1.5 kg) Maris Otter liquid malt extract. Place crushed pale ale malt with the flaked barley in a nylon steeping bag. Heat 4 quarts (3.8 L) of brewing liquor to 163 °F (73 °C) and submerge bag. Steep grains at 152 °F (67 °C) for 45 minutes. Place the roasted and crystal malts in a second nylon grain bag and submerge in the mash. Steep for 15 more minutes. Rinse both grain bags with 4 quarts (3.8 L) of water at 170 °F (77 °C). Add water to "grain tea" to make 3 gallons (11 L) of wort. Add dried malt extract and bring to a boil. Bring to a boil, adding ingredients at times indicated and the liquid malt extract with 15 minutes remaining. After the boil, chill the wort then top off to 5 gallons (19 L) and follow the remaining portion of the all-grain recipe.

12.9 AAU Amarillo® hops (first wort hop) (1.5 oz./43 g at 8.6% alpha acids)
1.5 oz. (43 g) Amarillo® hops (0 min.)
1 oz. (28 g) Citra® hops (hop stand)
1 oz. (28 g) Galaxy™ hops (hop stand)
1 oz. (28 g) Mosaic® hops (hop stand)
3 oz. (85 g) Citra® hops (dry hop)
1.5 oz. (43 g) Galaxy™ hops (dry hop)
1.5 oz. (43 g) Mosaic® hops (dry hop)
GigaYeast GY054 (Vermont IPA) or White Labs WLP095 (Burlington Ale) yeast
3⁄4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
On brew day, prepare your ingredients; mill the grains, measure your hops, and prepare your water. This recipe uses reverse osmosis (RO) water. Add 1⁄4 tsp 10% phosphoric acid per 5 gallons (19 L) of brewing water, or until water measures pH 5.5 at room temperature. Add 3⁄4 tsp. calcium chloride (CaCl2) and 1⁄4 tsp. calcium sulfate (CaSO4) to the mash.

On brew day, mash in all the grains at 152 °F (67 °C) in 5 gallons (19 L) of water, and hold this temperature for 60 minutes. Raise the temperature by infusion or direct heating to 168 °F (76 °C) to mashout. Recirculate for 15 minutes. Fly sparge with 168 °F (76 °C) water until 6.5 gallons (25 L) of wort is collected.

Boil the wort for 75 minutes, adding the hops at times indicated in the recipe. The first wort hops are added to the kettle just before lautering begins. The 0 minute hops get added right after the heat is turned off. Stir the wort gently and allow to cool to 180 °F (82 °C) then add the hop stand hops. Allow to stand for 20 minutes then chill to 64 °F (18 °C) and rack to the fermenter.

Oxygenate, then pitch the yeast. Start fermentation at 64 °F (18 °C), allowing temperature to rise naturally as fermentation progresses. Mix the dry hops and divide into three equal portions. The first portion gets added after two days of active fermentation. The second portion gets added at the end of fermentation.

The third portion gets added three days after fermentation ends. Allow each dry hop addition to be in contact with the beer for two to three days, then remove.

Rack the beer, prime and bottle condition, or keg and force carbonate to 2.5 volumes. Do not filter or fine the beer.

New Holland describes Dragon’s Milk as, "A stout with roasty malt character intermingled with deep vanilla tones, all dancing in an oak bath."

Ingredients
15 lbs. (6.8 kg) 2-row pale malt
2 lbs. (0.91 kg) Munich malt
8 oz. (0.23 kg) crystal malt (80 °L)
8 oz. (0.23 kg) crystal malt (120 °L)
7 oz. (0.2 kg) Carapils malt
10 oz. (0.3 kg) chocolate malt
8 oz. (0.23 kg) Carafa III malt
12 oz. (0.34 kg) flaked barley
1 oz. (28 g) oak chips
4 oz. (113 g) Jim Beam or similar Bourbon whiskey
6.8 AAU Nugget pellet hops (60 min.) (0.6 oz./17 g at 13% alpha acids)
1.13 AAU Glacier pellet hops (15 min.) (0.75 oz./21 g at 6% alpha acids)
1⁄2 tsp. yeast nutrient (15 min.)
White Labs WLP001 (American Ale) or Wyeast 1056 (American Ale) or Safale US-05 yeast
3/4 cup (150 g) dextrose (if priming)

Step by Step
This is a single step infusion mash. Mix the crushed grain and flaked oats with 25.4 quarts (24 L) of 172 °F (78 °C) water to stabilize at 156 °F (69 °C) for 60 minutes. Sparge slowly with 175 °F (79 °C) water. Collect at least 6 gallons (23 L) of wort runoff to boil for 60 minutes (or more if you want to boil down to help boost your OG), adding hops at times indicated. Cool the wort to 75 °F (24 °C). Pitch your yeast and aerate the wort heavily. Allow the beer to cool to 68 °F (20 °C). Hold at that temperature until fermentation is complete. Soak the oak chips in the Bourbon for at least one week. Transfer the wort to a carboy, avoiding any splashing to prevent aerating the beer and add the soaked oak chips. Let the beer condition for one week and then bottle or keg.

Extract with grains option:
Substitute all the 2-row pale malts and 1 lb. (0.45 kg) of the Munich malt in the all-grain recipe with 6.6 lbs. (3 kg) Briess light liquid malt extract, 3.3 lbs. (1.5 kg) Briess Munich liquid malt extract and 12 oz. (0.34 kg) Briess extra light dried malt extract. Steep the crushed Munich malt and flaked barley in 1.5 gallons (6 L) of water at 154 °F (68 °C) for 30 minutes. Add the remaining crushed grains and steep and additional 15 minutes. Remove grains from the wort and place in a colander, then rinse with 4 quarts (4 L) of hot water. Add the liquid and dried malt extracts, top off to 6 gallons (23 L) and bring to a boil. Follow the remaining portion of the all-grain recipe.

(5 gallon/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.164FG = 1.041
IBU= 40 SRM = 16 ABV = 17%

This massive American-style barleywine from Anchorage Brewing (Anchorage, Alaska) utilizes only one hop variety and loads of malt to ring in at 17% ABV. Anchorage ages it for 11 months in Cognac barrels.

Ingredients
29 lbs. (13.2 kg) 2-row pale malt
1 lb. (0.45 kg) crystal malt (120 °L)
1 lb. (0.45 kg) table sugar
7.3 AAU GalaxyTM hops (60 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 14.6% alpha acids)
18.25 AAU GalaxyTM hops (15 min.) (1.25 oz./35 g at 14.6% alpha acids)
1 tsp. yeast nutrients (10 min.)
White Labs WLP099 (Super High Gravity Ale) yeast
2⁄3 cup corn sugar (if priming)
Lallemand CBC-1 or White Labs WLP099 (Super High Gravity Ale) (if priming)

Step by Step

There are several ways to approach brewing a beer this big. You can perform this as a parti-gyle brew and produce a smaller 3-gallon (11-L) sized barleywine and a second more sessionable table beer. You could also use more pale malt to have a higher volume of first runnings. Or you could also perform a sparge, which will yield more wort and require a much more extensive boil. Since the extensive boil is what Anchorage Brewing Co. does, we’ll outline that procedure here and supplement with some sugar to get up to Anchorage’s starting gravity.

This is a single infusion mash, targeting about 1 qt./lb. (2.1 L/kg) water-to-grain mash ratio, roughly 30 quarts (28.4 L). Mash in at 148 °F (64 °C) and hold there for 90 minutes. Next, recirculate until wort is clear and collect as much wort as you can. Bring this up to a boil as soon as possible. Fill the mash tun back up with 24 quarts (22.7 L) of water at 180 °F (82 °C) to mash out. Stir and then recirculate until wort is clear and collect as much as you can. Once you have collected all of the wort, take a specific gravity reading of room temperature wort. The mash should yield approximately 10 gallons (38 L) of 1.078 wort. Add the table sugar and bring wort to a boil and boil for a target volume 5.25 gallons (20 L) in your kettle at the end of boil. Anchorage boils A Deal with the Devil for 5 hours. Depending on your boil-off rate, it may take even longer to achieve this final volume. Add the majority of the hops at the last 15 minutes of the boil based on the current volume, targeting 40 IBUs.

Cool the wort and add the yeast from either a large starter or repitching yeast from a recently brewed batch of beer. Be sure you have fresh and active yeast, with at least two to three times the usual amount of yeast you’d use for a regular ale. Oxygenate thoroughly and manage your fermentation by keeping it in the mid-60s °F (~18 °C). You may want to hit the wort with a second round of oxygen 24 hours after pitching the yeast.

Keep in primary fermenter 2-4 weeks, then transfer into a Cognac barrel or a secondary fermenter with French oak chips that have soaked in Cognac for several weeks. This will help emulate the barrel-aging effect. Age to preferred taste — Anchorage ages for 11 months. If bottle conditioning, be sure to pitch a fresh, highly alcohol-tolerant strain of yeast.

SRM = 35 IBU = 41 ABV = 6%

A deeper-colored London porter made from all English ingredients based in the tradition of the great English classics. Simpsons is New Realm’s preferred maltster, if available.

Ingredients
10 lbs. (4.5 kg) Maris Otter pale ale malt
1 lb. (454 g) brown or coffee malt (190 °L)
0.75 lb. (340 g) medium crystal malt (55 °L)
0.5 lb. (227 g) chocolate malt (450 °L)
7.1 AAU East Kent Goldings hops (60 min.) (1.5 oz./43 g at 4.75% alpha acids)
14.25 AAU East Kent Goldings (0 min.) (3 oz./85 g at 4.75% alpha acids)
SafAle S-04, White Labs WLP007 (Dry English Ale), Wyeast 1098 (British Ale), or equivalent yeast
¾ cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Mash in with 3.4 gallons (13 L) of water. With the goal of creating a dextrinous wort, achieve a mash temperature of 155 °F (68 °C) and hold for 45 minutes or until converted. If brewing with reverse osmosis or other pure water, be sure to add the salts as indicated in the "Tips for Success" section at the end of this recipe. Upon completion of the mash, raise temperature to 168 °F (76 °C) for mash out, recirculate, and prepare for sparge.

With sparge water at 170 °F (77 °C) and as close to 5.2 pH as possible, collect about 6 gallons (23 L) of wort, adding hops at beginning of boil and at the end of boil. If you choose to add a clarifier such as Irish moss or Whirlfloc, do so with 10 minutes left in the boil. At completion of boil, begin whirlpool then add final hops. Let sit for about 20 minutes.

Upon completion of whirlpool, chill as quickly as possible to 68 °F (20 °C), pitch yeast, and aerate if using a liquid yeast strain. Allow the beer to free rise to 72 °F (22 °C) but no higher. Fermentation should be fully complete in two weeks. If you want to achieve further clarity, chill before kegging or bottling. Carbonate to 2.65 v/v or bottle condition.

Ingredients
6.6 lbs. (3 kg) Muntons Maris Otter liquid malt extract
1 lb. (454 g) Maris Otter pale ale malt
1 lb. (454 g) brown or coffee malt (190 °L)
0.75 lb. (340 g) medium crystal malt (55 °L)

14.25 AAU East Kent Goldings (0 min.)(3 oz./85 g at 4.75% alpha acids)
SafAle S-04, White Labs WLP007 (Dry English Ale), Wyeast 1098 (British Ale), or equivalent yeast
¾ cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Using a muslin bag for easy removal of the grain, mash your pale ale and brown malts for 30 minutes in 3 gal. (11.4 L) of water at about 155 °F (68 °C). The goal is to break down any residual starch in the brown malt. Add the chocolate and crystal malts and allow to steep another 15 minutes.

When the mash is complete, remove the bag(s), draining the liquid without squeezing the bags. Raise temperature to near boiling and slowly stir in half of the malt extract. Return to the heat source and raise to boil. Boil for 60 minutes, adding bittering hops at the beginning, Whirlfloc/Irish moss (if desired) at 10 minutes remaining, and the rest of the extract with 5 minutes remaining. At completion of boil, whirlpool, adding final hops. Let sit for about 20 minutes.

Meanwhile, boil and chill about 2.5 gallons (9.5 L) of water so you can "top up" your fermenter later.
Upon completion of whirlpool, chill wort quickly to 68 °F (20 °C). Add pre-boiled and chilled water to top up to 5 gallons (19 L). (Ideally, your chilled water is also 68 °F/20 °C.) Pitch yeast and aerate if using a liquid yeast strain. Allow the beer to free rise to 72 °F (22.2 °C) but no higher. Fermentation should be fully complete in two weeks. If you want to achieve further clarity, chill before kegging or bottling. Carbonate to 2.65 v/v or bottle condition.

Tips For Success:
For all-grain brewers wanting the most authentic replication as possible, it’s important to mirror the water profile of the traditional London porters. This can be accomplished with the additions of 1/2 tsp. each of CaSO4 and CaCl2, a 1/4 tsp. of MgSO4, and just under 1 tsp. of CaCO3 in the mash, with the same additions, minus the CaCO3, in the kettle at start of boil.

Additionally, according to Steele, using Simpsons brand brown and chocolate malt is the preferred choice as this particular brand of malt delivers a unique flavor profile that is absolutely perfect for this beer style.

(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.098 FG = 1.009
IBU = 100+ SRM = 5 ABV = 11.5%

Named after the Czech god of hospitality, Mitch Steele’s Radegast IPA was first created with friends at Refuge Brewing in Temecula, California before becoming the annual anniversary beer at his brewery, New Realm of Atlanta, Georgia.

Ingredients
17 lbs. (7.71 kg) American 2-row pale malt
1 lb. 12 oz. (0.8 kg) dextrose corn sugar
18 AAU Warrior hops (60 min.) (1.2 oz./34 g at 15% alpha acids)
38.4 AAU Citra® hops (0 min.) (3.2 oz./91 g at 12% alpha acids)
48 AAU El Dorado® hops (0 min.) (3.2 oz./91 g at 15% alpha acids)
19.6 AAU Mosaic® hops (0 min.) (1.6 oz./45 g at 12.25% alpha acids)
3.2 oz. (91 g) Falconer’s Flight® hops (dry hop)
3.2 oz. (91 g) Citra® hops (dry hop)
3.2 oz. (91 g) El Dorado® hops (dry hop)
1 Whirlfloc tablet
1⁄2 tsp. yeast nutrient
Wyeast 1056 (American Ale), White Labs WLP001 (California Ale), or SafAle US-05 yeast
2⁄3 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by step
Using a thin mash to maximize enzymatic activity and fermentability (roughly 4:1 water-to-grain by weight), mash for 75 minutes at 150 °F (65.5 °C). A mash pH between 5.2–5.7 is ideal. A 1⁄4 tsp. addition of phosphoric acid should get your mash in range if using reverse osmosis water. After mash is complete, raise temperature to 168–170 °F (76–77 °C) for mashout and recirculation. Begin collecting your wort and sparge with 170 °F (77 °C) water with a pH as close to 5.2 as possible.

Boil for 60 minutes, adding the Warrior hop addition at the beginning of the boil. Add 1⁄2 tsp. of yeast nutrient and dextrose with 10 minutes to go in the boil, as well as a Whirlfloc tablet to produce a clearer finished beer.

At the end of the boil, whirlpool for 10 minutes after adding the flameout hops. Chill rapidly to 68 °F (20 °C) and oxygenate thoroughly. It’s important to keep your fermentation temperature from rising in order to avoid fusel alcohol production. After 7 days of primary fermentation, reduce temperature to 60 °F (16 °C) and add your dry hops. After day 10, add Biofine® or another clarifying agent if you want a clearer finished beer, then chill to 32 °F (0 °C). Hold at this temperature for another two weeks, then keg and carbonate to 2.3 v/v or prime and bottle condition.

Ingredients
9.2 lbs. (4.2 kg) extra light dried malt extract (DME)
1 lb. 12 oz. (0.8 kg) dextrose corn sugar
18 AAU Warrior hops (60 min.) (1.2 oz./34 g at 15% alpha acids)
38.4 AAU Citra® hops (0 min.) (3.2 oz./91 g at 12% alpha acids)
48 AAU El Dorado® hops (0 min.) (3.2 oz./91 g at 15% alpha acids)
19.6 AAU Mosaic® hops (0 min.) (1.6 oz./45 g at 12.25% alpha acids)

3.2 oz. (91 g) Citra® hops (dry hop)
3.2 oz. (91 g) El Dorado® hops (dry hop)
1 Whirlfloc tablet
1⁄2 tsp. yeast nutrient
Wyeast 1056 (American Ale), White Labs WLP001 (California Ale), or SafAle US-05 yeast
2⁄3 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by step
Use 3 gallons (11.4 L) of clean water and heat to around 150–160 °F (65.5–71 °C). Take the pot off the flame and slowly add the DME while stirring continuously until all extract is dissolved. The exact temperature is not all that important since there is no mashing, but keeping it in this range will help avoid boil over when putting in the DME. Once dissolved, return pot to the heat and bring to a boil. Boil for 60 minutes, adding the hops as indicated.

In the meantime, prepare 2–2.5 gallons (7.6–9.5 L) of water to add to your wort to top up after boil is complete. To be safe, it’s best to boil that water, then chill it, to ensure elimination of any contaminants in the water.

Add 1⁄2 tsp. of yeast nutrient and dextrose with 10 minutes to go in the boil, as well as a Whirlfloc tablet to produce a clearer finished beer.

At the end of the boil, whirlpool for 10 minutes after adding the flameout hops. Chill rapidly to 68 °F (20 °C) and oxygenate thoroughly. It’s important to keep your fermentation temperature from rising in order to avoid fusel alcohol production. After 7 days of primary fermentation, reduce temperature to 60 °F (16 °C) and add your dry hops. After day 10, add Biofine® or another clarifying agent if you want a clearer finished beer, then chill to 32 °F (0 °C). Hold at this temperature for another two weeks, then keg and carbonate to 2.3 v/v or prime and bottle condition.

Step by Step
New Ventures Brewing starts with Burtonizing their water to the following level: Calcium 295 ppm, magnesium 45 ppm, sodium 55 ppm, sulfate 725 ppm, chloride 25 ppm, and bicarbonate 300 ppm. This is a multi-step infusion mash, starting with a protein rest at 132 °F (56 °C) for 20 minutes. Raise temperature for beta amylase rest at 145 °F (63 °C) and hold for 60 minutes. Raise mash to alpha amylase rest at 155 °F (68 °C) for 10 minutes. Finally mash out at 168 °F (76 °C) for 5 minutes, then begin the vorlauf and sparge steps. (Alternate: You can use a single infusion mash at 148 °F (64 °C) for 60 minutes).

During the sparge, add the first wort hops to the kettle. Bring wort to a boil and add hops, ginger, Irish moss, and yeast nutrients per the ingredients schedule. When the boil is complete, remove from heat and whirlpool for 10 minutes then let settle.

Chill wort to 68 °F (20 °C), oxygenate the wort if using liquid yeast, then pitch the yeast. Hold at this temperature until reaching terminal gravity (5–10 days). Raise temperature to 70 °F (21 °C) for 3–5 days or until getting a negative diacetyl precursor test. Drop to 50 °F (10 °C) for 24 hours, dump yeast or transfer to secondary and add the second ginger addition. Hold at this temperature for five days and then cold crash and bottle or keg as usual. Carbonate to 2.4 v/v.

Step by Step
If you are interested in tinkering with water, we recommend cutting the additions in half compared to the all-grain recipe as malt extracts come with their own salts. Starting with 5-gallons (19-L) of water in your brew kettle, heat the water up to 160 °F (71 °C), then submerge the crushed caramel malts in a muslin bag. Let steep 20 minutes then remove the grains, allowing the liquid to drip back into the kettle. Stir in the dried malt extract, then heat the wort up to a boil once the extract is fully dissolved. Follow the remainder of the all-grain recipe.

New Zealand Pilsner
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.050 FG = 1.012
IBU = 38 SRM = 3 ABV = 5%

This pale lager combines some of the better attributes of Pilsner and Kölsch with intriguing modern New Zealand hops.

Ingredients
5 lbs. (2.3 kg) US 2-row malt
5 lbs. (2.3 kg) German Pilsner malt
5 oz. (142 g) German wheat malt
5.3 AAU Motueka hops (FWH) (0.7 oz./20 g at 7.5% alpha acids)
6 AAU (14 g) Nelson Sauvin hops (10 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 12.1% alpha acids)
5.5 AAU Riwaka hops (5 min.) (1 oz./28 g at 5.5% alpha acids)
Fermentis Saflager W-34/70 or Wyeast 2124 (Bohemian Lager) or White Labs WLP830 (German Lager) yeast
3⁄4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
On brew day, prepare your ingredients; mill the grains, measure your hops, and prepare your water. This recipe uses reverse osmosis (RO) water. Add 1/4 tsp 10% phosphoric acid per 5 gallons (19 L) of brewing water, or until water measures pH 5.5 at room temperature. Add 1 tsp. calcium chloride (CaCl2) to the mash.

On brew day, mash in all the grains at 149 °F (65 °C) in 16 qts. (15 L) of water, and hold this temperature for 60 minutes. Raise the temperature by infusion or direct heating to 168 °F (76 °C) to mashout. Recirculate for 15 minutes. Fly sparge with 168 °F (76 °C) water until 6.5 gallons (25 L) of wort is collected.

Boil the wort for 75 minutes, adding the hops at times indicated in the ingredients list. The first wort hops are added to the kettle just before sparging begins. Chill to 48 °F (9 °C) and rack to the fermenter. Oxygenate, then pitch the yeast. Start fermentation at 48 °F (9 °C), allowing temperature to rise naturally to 50 °F (10 °C) as fermentation progresses. After fermentation is complete, rack the beer to secondary and lager for 12 weeks at 0 °F (32 °C). Fine the beer with gelatin if needed. Bottle or keg as usual.

New Zealand Pilsner
(5 gallons/19 L, extract only)
OG = 1.050 FG = 1.012
IBU = 38 SRM = 3 ABV = 5%

Ingredients
6.8 lbs. (3.1 kg) Pilsner liquid malt extract
5.3 AAU Motueka hops (FWH) (0.7 oz./20 g at 7.5% alpha acids)
6 AAU (14 g) Nelson Sauvin hops (10 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 12.1% alpha acids)
5.5 AAU Riwaka hops (5 min.) (1 oz./28 g at 5.5% alpha acids)
Fermentis Saflager W-34/70 or Wyeast 2124 (Bohemian Lager) or White Labs WLP830 (German Lager) yeast
3⁄4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Use 6 gallons (23 L) of water in the brew kettle; heat to 158 °F (70 °C) then turn off the heat. Add the malt extract and stir thoroughly to dissolve the extract completely. You do not want to feel liquid extract at the bottom of the kettle when stirring with your spoon. Turn the heat back on and bring the wort to a boil.

Boil the wort for 60 minutes, adding the hops at times indicated in the ingredients list. The first wort hops are added to the kettle just after the malt extract is dissolved but before bringing to a boil. Chill to 48 °F (9 °C) and rack the wort to the fermenter.

Oxygenate, then pitch the yeast. Start fermentation at 48 °F (9 °C), allowing temperature to rise naturally to 50 °F (10 °C) as fermentation progresses. After fermentation is complete, rack the beer to secondary and lager for 12 weeks at 0 °F (32 °C). Fine the beer with gelatin if needed. Bottle or keg as usual.

OG = 1.032 FG = 1.005
IBU = 5 SRM = 3 ABV = 3.5%

This recipe is inspired by Michael Tonsmeire's modern take on the no-boil method. Make sure to keep your IBUs extremely low (<5 IBUs) to insure that the Lactobacillus will not be inhibited.

Ingredients
4 lbs. (1.8 kg) Pilsner malt
2.5 lbs. (1.13 kg) wheat malt
Rice hulls (optional)
4.5 AAU Hallertau Mittelfrüh hops (mash hop) (1 oz./28 g at 4.5% alpha acid)
Wyeast 5335 (Lactobacillus) or White Labs WLP677 (Lactobacillus Bacteria)
Wyeast 1007 (German Ale) or White Labs WLP036 (Dusseldorf Alt) yeast
Priming sugar (if bottling)

Step by Step
One week prior to brew day, make a 1 qt. (1 L) starter with the Lactobacillus. Do not place the starter on a stir plate but try to get the starter in a spot near your house boiler where temperatures would be above room temperature or a similar location with elevated temperatures. This should give the Lacto a jump start in order to get a nicely soured beer. If you are able to find one of the Berliner weisse yeast blends, you can alternatively pick up Wyeast 3191 (Berliner Weisse Blend) or White Labs WLP630 (Berliner Weisse Blend) or East Coast Yeast ECY06 (Berliner Blend) yeast which would blend one or more strains of Lactobacillus bacteria as well as a German ale yeast plus sometimes a Brettanomyces yeast as well.

This is a decoction mash. Dough-in with 4 qts. (3.8 L) water, mix the crushed grains and hops to achieve a mash temperature of 95 °F (35 °C). Rest for 10 minutes then raise the grain bed to 135 °F (57 °C) with the addition of boiling water. Let rest for 10 minutes then pull (decoct) half the grains (thick mash with little wort) and boil the grains for 20 minutes stirring often to avoid scorching them. Return the decocted portion back to the main mash to help raise the temperature up to saccharification temperatures to 152 °F (67 °C) for saccharification conversion. Rest at this temperature for 45 minutes. At this point you can pull a second decoction, which would require you to cut down on your mash hop quantities to half an ounce (14 g) or you can simply raise your mash up to 170 °F (77 °C) by using a recirculating heat method or by infusing boiling water to the mash. If you are using rice hulls add them prior to starting your lauter. Rest for 15 minutes and begin lauter phase. Once you start running off, send the wort directly into the wort chiller or fermenter. If you are fly sparging, be wary of the specific gravity or more specifically the pH of your run-off. If the pH of your grain bed rises above 6, your brew is susceptible to tannin extraction. One solution is to acidify your sparge water to pH 6 with the addition of phosphoric or lactic acid.

Collect 5 gallons (19 L) of wort. If the wort is not chilled, place wort in a cool spot or fridge to get it down to about 110 °F (43 °C) and pitch the pure Lactobacillus. Make sure that you have raised the temperature of the Lacto starter up to about this temperature as well since you don't want to shock the bacteria. After about 12 hours when the temperature of the wort has cooled to yeast fermentation temperature of 65 °F (18 °C), pitch the ale yeast and hold at this temperature for duration of primary fermentation. Do not aerate the wort.

After primary fermentation is complete, you can raise the temperature of the wort up to around 80 °F (27 °C) to let the souring process occur more rapidly. One to three months of aging would be a minimal recommended time period to properly sour this beer. Carbonate the beer to three volumes of CO2. For carbonation guidelines, visit, visit https://byo.com/resources/carbonation. You can serve this beer with a raspberry syrup known as Himbeere (red) or a woodruff syrup know as Waldmeister (green). This is a light and refreshing brew best enjoyed on a hot summer afternoon.

9.8 AAU Nugget leaf hops (60 min.) (0.75 oz./21 g at 13% alpha acids)
9.8 AAU Nugget leaf hops (30 min.) (0.75 oz./21 g at 13% alpha acids)
1⁄2 tsp. Irish moss (15 min.)
Wyeast 1968 (London ESB), White Labs WLP002 (English Ale), or Lallemand Windsor yeast
3⁄4 cup (150 g) dextrose (if priming)

Step by Step

This is a single step infusion mash. Mix the crushed grains with 5.5 gallons (21 L) of water at 163 °F (73 °C), stabilizing at 152 °F (67 °C) for 60 minutes until conversion is complete. Raise the temperature of the mash to 168 °F (76 °C) with approximately 3.1 gallons (11.7 L) of 200 °F (93 °C) water, and then collect 7 gallons (26.5 L) of wort to begin your 60-minute boil. Add hops and Irish moss at times indicated. At the end of the boil there should be 5.5 gallons (21 L) wort left in your kettle. Chill the wort rapidly and pitch the yeast when the temperature is less than 75 °F (24 °C), and allow to cool to 68 °F (20 °C) for fermenting. Add the 2 vanilla beans to the fermenter after slicing one side of the bean open to expose the inside of the vanilla bean. When fermentation is complete, do a 3-day diacetyl rest, and then bottle or keg. Carbonate to approximately 2 to 2.5 volumes.

Partial mash option:
Substitute the 2-row pale malt in the all-grain recipe with 6.6 lbs. (3 kg) pale liquid malt extract and 1.5 lbs. (0.68 kg) extra light dried malt extract. Place the crushed Vienna and flaked oats in a muslin bag and mash in 2 qts. (2 L) of water at 150–160 °F (66–71 °C) for 30 minutes. Then, add 3 gallons (11.4 L) of 150–160 °F (66–71 °C) water and the crystal and roasted grains in a separate muslin bag. Hold for 30 minutes more. Remove both grain bags from the hot water and wash them with 1 gallon (4 L) of hot water. Bring wort to a boil. When boiling starts, remove pot from the burner and slowly add all of the dried malt extract, stirring to dissolve. Return to a boil for 60 minutes, adding the hops and Irish moss as indicated. Top off to 5 gallons (19 L). Follow the remaining portion of the all-grain recipe.

The vanilla helps to make a more sherbet-like balance. You can add lactose to taste at packaging if you want more sweetness. The hop extract increases head retention, improving the perceived creaminess of the body and appearance of the beer. Lowering the pH before souring reduces protein breakdown by the bacteria, improving body and head retention.

Ingredients
9 lbs. (4.1 kg) Dingemans Pilsen malt
2 lbs. (0.91 kg) flaked oats
1 vanilla bean (day 5)
6 lbs. (2.7 kg) white nectarines, sliced or pureed (day 7)
4 lbs. (1.8 kg) white peaches, sliced or pureed (day 7)
1 Tbsp. lactic acid
1 g Kalsec Tetralone (tetra iso extract) (keg or bottling bucket)
2 GoodBelly Straight Shot (Lactobacillus plantarum)
Safale S-04 or Wyeast 1099 (Whitbread Ale) yeast
4 oz. (113 g) table sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
My water profile was as follows, 85 ppm calcium, 75 ppm chloride, 90 ppm sulfate, 15 ppm sodium, 10 ppm magnesium, and 90 ppm bicarbonate. Mash at 152 °F (67 °C) for 45 min. The wort is not boiled, only heated to 170 °F (77 °C), then chill to 85 °F (29 °C). Pitch two Goodbelly Straight Shots or another source of Lactobacillus brevis or Lactobacillus plantarum of your choice. Lower wort pH to 4.4-4.5 with approximately 1 Tbsp. (15 mL) of lactic acid. Leave at 68-70 °F (20-21 °C) to sour. After 24–36 hours of souring, aerate and pitch rehydrated S-04 or an English ale yeast strain of your choice. You may want to pasteurize the wort prior to pitching the brewer’s yeast if you want to mitigate the risk of Lacto infection in your brewery.

After five days, add one vanilla bean, split lengthwise. After a week, add fruit. Slice or puree the fruit discarding the pits but retaining the skins. After two weeks on the fruit, package adding the hop extract to the keg or bottling bucket while siphoning the beer. If serving on nitrogen, chill and pressurize to 20-25 PSI with beer gas. Otherwise, package the beer as you normally would.

California Lager is Anchor's re-creation of a lager brewed in California way back in 1876 at a brewey named Boca. It features a golden color, creamy head, and a smooth finish.

Ingredients
10 lbs. (4.54 kg) 2-row pale malt
4.9 AAU Cluster pellet hops (60 min.) (0.65 oz./18 g at 7.5% alpha acids)
2.6 AAU Cluster pellet hops (30 min.) (0.35 oz./10 g at 7.5% alpha acids)
White Labs WLP830 (German Lager) or Wyeast 2206 (Bavarian Lager) or Fermentis Saflager S-23 yeast
0.25 oz. (7 g) gypsum (optional if using very low mineral water)
2⁄3 cup (133 g) dextrose (if priming)

Step by Step
Mill the grains and mix with 3.75 gallons (14 L) of 157 °F (69 °C) strike water and optional gypsum (see ingredients) to reach a mash temperature of 149 °F (65 °C). Hold this temperature for 60 minutes. Vorlauf until your runnings are clear. Sparge the grains with 3.45 gallons (13 L) of 168 °F (76 °C) water and top up if necessary to obtain 6 gallons (23 L) of 1.039 SG wort. Boil for 60 minutes, adding hops according to the ingredients list. After the boil, turn off the heat and chill the wort to slightly below fermentation temperature, about 48 °F (9 °C). Aerate the wort with pure oxygen or filtered air and pitch the yeast. Ferment at 50 °F (10 °C) for 7 days before raising to 60 °F (16 °C) for three days for a diacetyl rest. Slowly lower the beer to 34 °F (1 °C). Once at terminal gravity (approximately 14 days total) bottle or keg the beer and carbonate. Lager at 34 °F (1 °C) for approximately one month before serving.

Extract with grains option:
Substitute the 2-row pale malt in the all-grain recipe with 6.6 lbs. (3 kg) golden liquid malt extract. Bring 5.5 gallons (21 L) of water and optional gypsum (see ingredients list) to a boil, turn off the flame, and stir in the liquid malt extract until completely dissolved. Top up with water if necessary to obtain 6 gallons (23 L) of 1.039 SG wort. Boil for 60 minutes. Follow the remaining portion of the all-grain recipe.

Tips for Success
The theme here is "less is more." Rather than going heavy on the chocolate malts, this recipe spreads the wealth and includes healthy additions of light crystal, dark crystal, brown malt, and then drops in an appropriate amount of roast and coffee flavor. It increases its intense, flinty impression through a fairly aggressive bittering regimen, which is then softened a bit by complex herbal and earthy aromas and flavors from the late hops addition. Earlier versions were actually a little too "soft," so if you have particularly soft water it may not be a bad adjustment to harden it up a bit with some gypsum in the mash! The fermentation temperature starts and stays low through the bulk of the fermentation process, which might entail a slightly longer wait to ensure that the beer is fully attenuated – wait at least a week after all visible signs of fermentation have ended before packaging.

Northern English Brown Ale
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.051 FG = 1.013
IBU = 26 SRM = 14 ABV = 5.1%

Ingredients
8.82 lb. (4 kg) Crisp British pale ale malt 3 °L (or similar)
10.6 oz. (300 g) Briess special roast (50 °L)
5 oz. (143 g) Great Western crystal malt (40 °L) (or similar)
5 oz. (143 g) Briess Victory® malt (28 °L) (or similar)
4 oz. (113 g) Crisp pale chocolate (200 °L) (or similar)
3.5 AAU East Kent Goldings hops (60 min.) (0.7 oz./20 g at 5% alpha acids)
3.5 AAU East Kent Goldings hops (5 min.) (0.7 oz./20 g at 5% alpha acids)
White Labs WLP013 (London Ale), Wyeast 1028 (London Ale) or Fermentis Safale S-04 yeast

Step by Step
I use Crisp Malting's British Pale Ale malt (made from Maris Otter) as my base grain, but other malts of a similar nature should work well (see some suggestions in my Style Profile column on Northern English Brown Ales). Remember, the bulk of the flavor comes from the base grain, so try to get British pale ale malt.

Mill the grains and dough-in targeting a mash of around 1.5 quarts of water to 1 pound of grain (a liquor-to-grist ratio of about 3:1 by weight) and a temperature of 152 °F (67 °C). Hold the mash at 152 °F (67 °C) until enzymatic conversion is complete. Infuse the mash with near boiling water while stirring or with a recirculating mash system raise the temperature to mash out at 168 °F (76 °C). Sparge slowly with 170 °F (77 °C) water, collecting wort until the pre-boil kettle volume is around 5.9 gallons (22.3 L) and the gravity is 1.044 (10.9 °P).

Once the wort is boiling, add the bittering hops. The total wort boil time is 60 minutes after adding the bittering hops. With 15 minutes left add the Irish moss or other kettle finings and at five minutes left add the last hop addition. Chill the wort to 68 °F (20 °C) and aerate thoroughly. The proper pitch rate is 9 grams of properly rehydrated dry yeast or two packages of liquid yeast.

Ferment around 68 °F (20 °C) until the yeast drops clear. With healthy yeast, fermentation should be complete in a week or less. Allow the lees to settle and the brew to mature without pressure for another two days after fermentation appears finished.

Rack to a keg and force carbonate or rack to a bottling bucket, add priming sugar, and bottle. Target a carbonation level of 1 to 2 volumes depending on your packaging. Serve the finished beer at 50 to 55 °F (10 to 13 °C).

Northern English Brown Ale
(5 gallons/19 L, extract with grains)
OG = 1.050 FG = 1.012
IBU = 26 SRM = 14 ABV = 5%

Ingredients
5.73 lb. (2.6 kg) Maris Otter liquid malt extract (4°L)10.6 oz. (300 g) Briess special roast (50 °L)
5 oz. (143 g) Great Western crystal malt (40 °L) (or similar)
5 oz. (143 g) Briess Victory® malt (28 °L) (or similar)
4 oz. (113 g) Crisp pale chocolate (200 °L) (or similar)
3.5 AAU East Kent Goldings hops (60 min.) (0.7 oz./20 g at 5% alpha acids)
3.5 AAU East Kent Goldings hops (5 min.) (0.7 oz./20 g at 5% alpha acids)
White Labs WLP013 (London Ale), Wyeast 1028 (London Ale) or Fermentis Safale S-04 yeast

Step by Step
I use an English-type liquid malt extract custom made for my homebrew shop from a 100% Maris Otter malt. Always choose the freshest extract that fits the beer style. If you can't get fresh liquid malt extract, it is better to use dried malt extract (DME) instead.

Mill or coarsely crack the specialty malt and place loosely in a grain bag. Avoid packing the grains too tightly in the bag, using more bags if needed. Steep the bag in about 1 gallon (~4 L) of water at roughly 170 °F (77 °C) for about 30 minutes.

Lift the grain bag out of the steeping liquid and rinse with warm water. Allow the bags to drip into the kettle for a few minutes while you add the malt extract. Do not squeeze the bags. Add enough water to the steeping liquor and malt extract to make a pre-boil volume of 5.9 gallons (22.3 L) and a gravity of 1.043 (10.6 °P). Stir the wort thoroughly to help dissolve the extract and bring to a boil.

Once the wort is boiling, add the bittering hops. The total wort boil time is 60 minutes after adding the bittering hops. With 15 minutes left add the Irish moss or other kettle finings and at five minutes left add the last hop addition. Chill the wort to 68 °F (20 °C) and aerate thoroughly. The proper pitch rate is 9 grams of properly rehydrated dry yeast or two packages of liquid yeast.

Ferment around 68 °F (20 °C) until the yeast drops clear. With healthy yeast, fermentation should be complete in a week or less. Allow the lees to settle and the brew to mature without pressure for another two days after fermentation appears finished.

Rack to a keg and force carbonate or rack to a bottling bucket, add priming sugar, and bottle. Target a carbonation level of 1 to 2 volumes depending on your packaging. Serve the finished beer at 50 to 55 °F (10 to 13 °C).

Norweigian Christmas Ale
(5 gallons/19 L, extract with grains)
OG = 1.063 FG = 1.016
IBU = 38 SRM = 21 ABV = 6.4%

Ingredients
7 lbs. (3.2 kg) amber liquid malt extract
1 lb. (0.45 kg) crystal malt (20° L)
1 lb. (0.45 kg) crystal malt (90° L)
2 oz. (57 g) roasted barley
4 oz. (113 g) maltodextrin powder
0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) light brown sugar
12 AAU Chinook hop pellets (45 min.) (1 oz/28 g at 12% alpha acids)
0.5 oz. (14 g) Cascade hop (0 min.)
1 vanilla bean, chopped
1 tsp. crushed cardamom seed
Wyeast 1056 (American Ale) or White Labs WLP001 (California Ale) or Safale US-05
3/4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
In 3 gals. (11 L) of cold water, steep crystal malts and roasted barley. Bring water gradually to 170 °F (77 °C) and remove grains. Add to the kettle malt syrup, malto-dextrin powder, and sugar. Bring to a boil and add Chinook hops. Boil 45 minutes, then turn off the heat. Add the Cascade hops and vanilla and cardamom. Give the wort a long stir to create a whirlpool and let settle for 15 minutes. Cool, top up to 5.25 gals., and pitch yeast. Ferment at 70 °F (21 °C) for 2 weeks. Prime and bottle.

Options
This recipe has gone through several permutations over the years, from the first version made from amber DME to an all-grain formulation (9 lbs. (4.1 kg) Belgian pale malt, 0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) Munich, 0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) amber malt, with the same specialty malts). To alter the color, change extracts. Use light or extra-light extract (and drop the roasted barley) to get a dark gold to light amber ale, or use dark extract for a brown version.

I like using the neutral ale yeast to allow the malts and spices to come out, but Wyeast 1084 Irish ale will work as well, leaving it more full bodied. Nottingham dry ale yeast is acceptable, too. I envision this as a lager (although I have yet to do it) fermented with Wyeast 2042 Danish lager yeast, and aged cold for three months to make it really smooth.

An alternative for the spices is to steep them in 1/2 cup of vodka for two months and add them at bottling time.

Tips for Success:
To be frank, this is an easy beer to get right! The only real issue may be for all-grain brewers with fussy mashing equipment: I’ve never had a stuck sparge situation here, but if you do, a pound of rice hulls should do the trick. You can sub in your favorite aroma hops for the five-minute addition (or whirlpool addition, if that’s your thing), but I’d recommend that you not overdo it.

The hops should add to the aroma, not overwhelm it. A pleasant grainy nose is a key part of the enjoyment level for this beer. I like the Wyeast 1007 (German Ale) yeast here because it adds a nice berry ester as a backing note in the flavor, but feel free to experiment with a favorite yeast for your own.

Not your average Kilkenny Stout
Not your average Kilkenny Stout
(5.5 gallons/21 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.064 FG = 1.025
IBU = 23 SRM = 40 ABV = 5.1%

This recipe is near and dear to my heart as someone of Irish descent. My inability to drink Guinness Stout was the cause of a great deal of sadness for myself, my friends, and my family when I first changed my diet. This recipe was highly complimented at Club Night at HomebrewCon, and one person described it as "a quintessential dry Irish Stout." I believe this recipe works for two reasons: 1) Such a layered blend of malts, 2) A high finishing gravity. With a final gravity of 1.025 you may ask, "how is it a dry Irish stout?" These grains always seem to taste on the dry side, so you need the residual sugars to balance the roasts in this beer, otherwise it can feel like drinking liquid ash. Feel free to use other adjuncts like cacao nibs or other flaked ingredients if you want to play around with the mouthfeel and use less maltodextrin.A

Ingredients
5 lbs. (2.3 kg) pale millet malt
2 lbs. (0.9 kg) buckwheat malt
2 lbs. (0.9 kg) chocolate roasted millet malt (140 °L)
1 lb. (0.45 kg) roasted CaraMillet malt (20 °L)
1 lb. (0.45 kg) French roast millet malt (325 °L)
1 lb. (0.45 kg) biscuit rice malt (5 °L)
1 lb. (0.45 kg) Goldfinch millet malt
0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) roasted buckwheat
0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) flaked quinoa
2 lbs. (0.9 kg) maltodextrin (15 min.)
1 lb. (0.45 kg) rice hulls
1 Tbsp. Termamyl Endo-Alpha Amylase
1 Tbsp. SEBamyl L
5 AAU East Kent Golding hops (60 min.) (1 oz./28 g at 5% alpha acids)
1 oz. (28 g) East Kent Golding hops (whirlpool)
Whirlfloc tablet (15 min.)
Yeast nutrient (15 min.)
Mangrove Jack’s M15 (Empire Ale) or Lallemand Nottingham Ale yeast
3⁄4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Heat 6 gallons (23 L) of strike water to 165 °F (74 °C), add 1 heaping Tbsp. of Termamyl Endo-Alpha Amylase. Mash in grains. The temperature of the mash will drop to about 150 °F (66 °C). Add 1 heaping Tbsp. of SEBamyl L. Rest for 1.5–2 hours, or until mash passes iodine test. You may want to raise mash temperature to 160 °F (71 °C) after an hour. Recirculate and heat mash to 168 °F (76 °C). Sparge with about 2.5 gallons (9.5 L) of water or enough to collect 6.5 gallons (25.6 L).

Boil for 60 minutes, adding hops according to the ingredients list. With 15 minutes remaining in the boil, mix maltodextrin with warm water before adding directly to boil — enough water to make it aqueous. Also add the Whirlfloc and yeast nutrients. At the end of the boil, turn off the heat and add the Kent Golding hops. Give the wort a long stir to create a whirlpool and let settle for 15 minutes.

Chill wort to yeast-pitching temperature and transfer to fermenter. Ferment at 68 °F (20 °C) until the gravity falls to 1.030 or below. Rack to secondary. Cold crash after one week, add biofine if you desire and hold until it’s as bright as you like. Bottle or keg as usual. Serve at cellar temperature for best malt expression.

Step by Step
Buy milled grains or mill grains at home (I use the triple blade Ninja blender at home for a few seconds because the grains are so small you need three passes in a mill). Place crushed grains in a muslin bag. Heat 7 gallons (27 L) of water to 135 °F (57 °C), then submerge the grains in the water and add 1⁄2 Tbsp. alpha amylase. Hold at this temperature for 30 minutes, then heat to 150 °F (66 °C). After 30 minutes, begin to heat to boil. Remove grains when the temperature hits 170 °F (77 °C), then stir in the syrup.

Bring to a boil and add hops according to the ingredients list. Follow the post-boil instructions in the all-grain version of this recipe.

Number 9 (Orange Blossom Honey Mead)
Number 9 (Semi-Sweet Orange Blossom Honey Mead)
(5 gallons/19 L)
OG = 1.093 FG = 1.023
ABV = 9.0%

Ingredients
12 lbs. 9 oz. (5.7 kg) orange blossom honey
4 tsp. yeast nutrients
2 tsp. tartartic acid
2 tsp. malic acid
3 pkg. Lalvin D-47 yeast (dried yeast)

Step by Step
Heat 1 gallon (3.8 L) of water to about 130 °F (54 °C). Pour as much of your honey into a sanitized bucket as will pour on its own. Scoop hot water as needed into your honey container(s) to dissolve the rest of the honey. Use a (sanitized) flexible spatula to scrape the sides of the container(s). Use only as much of the hot water as you need to dissolve the remaining honey.

Slowly add filtered tap water to your bucket, stirring constantly with a sanitized spoon, until you reach 5 gallons (19 L). Stir in yeast nutrients. Put 5 oz. (150 mL) of water at 109 °F (43 °C) in a large (sanitized) measuring cup. Proof the dried yeast by adding it to this warm water and letting it sit 15 minutes. Aerate the must, pitch the yeast, seal the bucket and let sit at 70–80 °F (21-27 °C).

Let the mead ferment until the rate of fermentation slows greatly (at least two months). Add acids to a 5-gallon (19-L) carboy and rack mead on top of them. If the carboy is not full to the neck, boil some water for 15 minutes, cool it quickly (but without splashing or otherwise aerating) and top up carboy. You may also want to add one crushed Campden tablet if you top up. Let mead sit until fermentation is finished and mead clears completely. Bottle and serve cold.

IBU = 38 SRM = 3 ABV = 7.25% pre-wine (7.4-7.6% post-wine)

*One of the two Brettanomyces strains I used in this beer was obtained from homebrewer Jason Rodriguez, who isolated it from a bottle of Brasserie Cantillon. Jason termed the strain CB2. Read about it at: http://www.themadfermentationist.com/2012/08/bottle-conditioning-with-brett-belgian.html. It has some similarities to the strains listed in the recipe.

Ingredients
8.3 lbs. (3.76 kg) Pilsner malt
4.2 lbs. (1.91 kg) wheat malt
11 AAU Rakau hop pellets (30 min.) (1 oz./28 g of 11% alpha acid)
14 AAU Motueka hop pellets (0 min.) (2 oz./56 g of 7% alpha acid)
24 AAU Nelson Sauvin hop pellets (0 min.) (2 oz./56 g of 12% alpha acid)
2 oz. (56 g) Motueka hop pellets (dry hop)
2 oz. (56 g) Nelson Sauvin hop pellets (dry hop)
1/2 tsp. yeast nutrient (15 min.)
1/2 Whirlfloc tablet (5 min.)
The Yeast Bay Saison Blend yeast
White Labs WLP644 (Brettanomyces bruxellensis trois) yeast
Wyeast 5112 (Brettanomyces bruxellensis) or White Labs WLP650 (Brettanomyces bruxellensis) yeast *
Wyeast 5223-PC (Lactobacillus brevis) or White Labs WLP672 (Lactobacillus brevis) bacteria
0.75-1.5 L Sauvignon Blanc white wine from New Zealand
1 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Heat 15 qts. (14 L) of water to achieve a mash temperature of 148 °F (67 °C). Hold at this temperature for 60 minutes or until conversion is complete. Sparge slowly with 170 °F (77 °C) water, collecting wort until the pre-boil kettle volume is around 6.5 gallons (24.6 L).

Boil the wort for 75 minutes adding the first hop addition with 30 minutes left in the boil and the second hops addition as you turn off the heat. Give the wort a long whirlpool stir and let settle for 30 minutes prior to chilling. After 30 minutes, chill the wort to 65 °F (18 °C), let the break material settle, rack to the fermenter, aerate the wort with filtered air or pure O2, and pitch all yeast and bacteria. Ferment at 75 °F (24 °C). Once the gravity is stable, add the dry hops. After two weeks add the wine to taste in the bottling bucket. Bottle or keg each aiming for 2.9 volumes of CO2. Use the priming chart at https://byo.com/resources/carbonation to determine your priming sugar needs. I prefer keg conditioning for hoppy beers with Brettanomyces because it allows me to serve them younger. The pressure of
the secondary fermentation also seems to increase the speed with which the Brettanomyces produces its signature character.

Anchor Brewing Company: Anchor Old Foghorn (1st Runnings)
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.099 FG = 1.030
IBU = 43 SRM = 22 ABV = 10%

Old Foghorn is brewed using the parti-gyle method, which is brewing two batches of beer by separating the first and second runnings to create two distinct beers — one high gravity, one lower gravity. Old Foghorn is the beer made from the first runnings. Small Beer is the beer made from the second runnings.

Ingredients
22.5 lbs. (10.2 kg) 2-row pale malt
5 lbs. 3 oz. (2.4 kg) caramel malt (40 °L)
6.8 AAU Cascade pellet hops (60 min.)
(1.5 oz./42 g at 4.5% alpha acids)
4.5 AAU Cascade pellet hops (30 min.)
(1 oz./28 g at 4.5% alpha acids)
1 oz. (28 g) Cascade pellet hops (dry hop)
White Labs WLP051 (California Ale V) or Wyeast 1272 (American Ale II) yeast
0.25 oz. (7 g) gypsum (optional if using very low mineral water)
2⁄3 (130 g) dextrose (if priming)

Step by Step
Mill grains and mix with 10.1 gallons (38.2 L) of 157 °F (69 °C) strike water and optional gypsum (see ingredients list) to reach a mash temperature of 149 °F (65 °C). Hold this temperature for 60 minutes. Vorlauf until your runnings are clear. Collect the first runnings without sparging and top up if necessary to obtain 7 gallons (26.5 L) of 1.071 SG wort. Boil for 120 minutes, adding hops according to the ingredients list. After the boil, turn of the heat and chill the wort to slightly below fermentation temperature, about 65 °F (18 °C). Aerate the wort with pure oxygen or filtered air and pitch yeast. Ferment at 67 °F (19 °C) for 4 days. Add dry hops and raise to 72 °F (22 °C) for three days. Once at terminal gravity (approximately 7 days total) bottle or keg the beer and carbonate. Age for 6–12 months before serving.

Extract with grains option:
Substitute the 2-row pale malt in the all-grain recipe with 12 lbs. (5.4 kg) golden liquid malt extract and reduce the caramel malt to 3 lbs. (2.4 kg). Place the milled grains in a muslin bag and steep in 10 quarts (9.4 L) of 149 °F (65 °C) water for 15 minutes. Remove the grain and rinse with 1 gallon (3.8 L) of hot water. Add water and optional gypsum (see ingredients list) to reach a volume of 5.25 gallons (19.9 L) and heat to boiling. Turn off the heat, add the liquid malt extract, and stir until completely dissolved. Top up with water if necessary to obtain 6 gallons (23 L) of 1.082 wort. Boil for 60 minutes. Follow the remaining portion of the all-grain recipe.

Oakhill Brewery's Yeoman Strong Ale clone
Oakhill Yeoman Strong Ale
Oakhill Brewery, UK
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.050 FG = 1.012
IBU = 66 SRM = 9 ABV = 4.8%

The Oakhill Brewery in Somerset closed down when the owner retired. This beer has obviously been renamed during its history and the information that I have for it is: OG: 1.049–1.050. Malt bill: 91.5% Triumph or Halcyon pale malt, 8.5% crystal malt. Hops: Bramling Cross, Challenger, Fuggles, Goldings. In this case, we have malt bill proportions, but no IBU, so again we have to guess. However, style guidelines are a good guide to expected ballpark IBU.

Ingredients
9 lb. 8 oz. (4.3 kg) Halcyon pale ale malt
11 oz. (0.31 kg) English crystal malt (60 °L)
4.35 AAU Challenger hops (90 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g of 8.7% alpha acid)
3.75 AAU East Kent Goldings hops (90 min.) (0.75 oz./21 g of 5% alpha acid)
4.13 AAU Bramling Cross hops (90 min.) (0.75 oz./21 g of 5% alpha acid)
4.5 AAU Fuggles hops (90 min.) (1 oz./28 g of 4.5% alpha acid)
1 tsp Irish moss (15 mins)
2 sachets Gervin English Ale or Safbrew S-33 or similar
English ale yeast

Step by Step
152 °F (67 °C) infusion mash temp for 60 minutes. 90-minute boil time. Ferment at 70 °F (21 °C). This recipe produced a full-bodied, but drinkable ale with pleasant fruit and bitterness.

2.9 AAU Cascade hop pellets (0 min.) (0.5 oz. /14 g at 5.75% alpha acids)
0.5 oz. (14 g) Centennial hop pellets (dry hop)
0.5 oz. (14 g) Cascade hop pellets (dry hop)
1⁄2 tsp. Irish moss (15 min.)
1⁄2 tsp. yeast nutrient (15 min.)
White Labs WLP001 (California Ale), Wyeast 1056 (American Ale), or Safale US-05 yeast
3⁄4 cup (150 g) dextrose (if priming)

Step by Step
This is a single step infusion mash. Mix the crushed grains with 3.7 gallons (14 L) of 172 °F (78 °C) water to stabilize at 153 °F (67 °C) for 60 minutes. Sparge slowly with 175 °F (79 °C) water. Collect approximately 6 gallons (23 L) of wort runoff to boil for 60 minutes adding hops at the times indicated. Cool the wort to 75 °F (24 °C). Pitch your yeast and aerate the wort heavily. Allow the beer to cool to 68 °F (20 °C). Hold at that temperature until fermentation is complete. Transfer to a carboy, avoiding any splashing to prevent aerating the beer and add the dry hops. Allow the beer to condition for one week and then bottle or keg.

Partial mash option:
Reduce the 2-row pale malt in the all-grain recipe to 1.5 lbs. (0.68 kg) and add 6.6 lbs. (3 kg) light liquid malt extract and 12 oz. (0.34 kg) light dried malt extract. Steep the crushed grain in 2 gallons (7.6 L) of water at 153 °F (67 °C) for 30 minutes. Remove grains from the wort and rinse with 2 quarts (1.8 L) of hot water. Add the malt extracts and boil for 60 minutes. Add the hops, Irish moss, and yeast nutrient as per the schedule. Now add the wort to 2 gallons (7.6 L) of cold water and top off with cold water up to 5 gallons (19 L). Follow the remaining portion of the all-grain recipe.

IBU = 13 SRM= 4 ABV = 5.2%

Ingredients
6 lbs. (2.7 kg) Briess bavarian wheat dried malt extract
3 AAUs Hallertauer pellet hops (60 min.) (0.75 oz./21 g at 4% alpha acid)
2 AAUs Hallertauer pellet hops (2 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g of 4% alpha acid)
Wyeast 3638 (Bavarian Wheat) or White Labs WLP300 (Hefeweizen Ale) or Lallemand Munich Classic yeast
7/8 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Add extract to 3 gallons (11 L) or more of hot water and bring to a boil for 30 min. Add 0.75 ounces of Hallertauer hops. Boil 58 min. and add the rest of the Hallertauer hops. Boil 2 min., remove from heat. Cool to about 60 °F (16 °C) and add water to yield about 5.25 gallons (20 L) in the fermenting vessel. Pitch yeast. Note: You can also cultivate yeast from a commercial hefeweizen, though many are bottle conditioned with a secondary ale or lager strain. Ferment at the low end of the recommended temperature range (from 60 to 66 °F/13 to 16 °C) until complete (7 to 10 days). Transfer to a secondary vessel or rack into bottles/keg with more corn sugar/higher carbonation rate than usual to help create that signature fizz.

All-Grain Option:
Omit extract and mash 5.5 lbs. (2.5 kg) of wheat malt and 5.5 lbs. (2.5 kg) of Pilsner malt in 14 quarts (13.2 L) of water to get a single infusion mash temperature of 152 °F (67 °C) and hold for 45 min. Sparge with hot water of 170 °F (77 °C) or more to get 6.5 gallons (24.6 L) of wort. Bring to boil and boil for 90 minutes total. Use above hopping and fermentation schedule.

Step-Mash Option:
For a step-mash, add 1.75 gallons (10.4 L) of hot water to the grain and hold at 110 °F (43 °C) for 30 min. for a ferulic acid rest, stirring every once in a while. Then add enough boiling water to the mash to bring the mash temperature up to about 152°F (67 °C) and hold for another 45 minutes. Sparge and proceed as usual.

Two or three days before brewing, make a yeast starter. (OG 1.015 to 1.020, aerated thoroughly before pitching the yeast. Ferment yeast starter in the mid 70s °F/~24 °C.)

On brewday, mash in at 152 °F (67 °C) for 60 minutes in 18 qts. (17 L) of water. Recirculate until wort clears and then begin running off wort. Sparge with water hot enough to make the grain bed temperature rise to 170 °F (77 °C) by the end of wort collection. (Or, mash out to 170 °F/77 °C and sparge with water hot enough to keep the grain bed at that temperature.) Collect at least 7.0 gallons (26 L) of wort (or monitor runnings and stop collecting wort when the specific gravity drops below 1.010). Boil wort 90 minutes (or until wort volume is reduced to 5 gallons/19 L). Add hops at times indicated. Add sugars with 15 minutes left in the boil. Chill wort, transfer to fermenter, aerate and pitch yeast sediment from starter. Ferment at 68 °F (20 °C). Dry hop beer in secondary for 7 days.

Step by Step
Mash the grains at 152 °F (67 °C). Mash out, vorlauf, and then sparge at 170 °F (77 °C) to collect about 7 gallons (27 L) of wort. Boil 90 minutes, adding hops as directed. After the boil is complete, give the wort a stir to create a whirlpool, then let settle for 20 minutes. If you don’t have a hopback device, add the hopback hops during the final couple minutes of the whirlpool, just prior to chilling. Then chill and pitch yeast. After primary fermentation, add dry hops 3–5 days and then chill to as close to 32 °F (0 °C) as you can for 1–2 weeks. Bottle or keg as normal.

Partial mash option: Omit pale ale malt. Replace with 1.75 lbs. (0.8 kg) light dried malt extract added at beginning of boil and 3.3 lbs. (1.5 kg) Maris Otter liquid malt extract added at the end of the boil. Place crushed grains in a nylon steeping bag and steep at 155 °F (68 °C) in 3.5 qts. (3.3 L) of water for 45 minutes. Rinse grains with 1.5 qts. (1.4 L) of water at 170 °F (77 °C). Add water (to save time, preferably boiling water) to "grain tea" to make 3 gallons (11 L), stir in dried malt extract and bring to a boil. Boil for 60 minutes, adding hops at times indicated. Stir in liquid malt extract with 15 minutes remaining in boil. Follow the remaining portion of the all-grain recipe, topping off to 5 gallons (19 L) after cooling.

Ingredients
4.25 lbs. (1.9 kg) Maris Otter pale malt
3 lbs. (1.4 kg) Vienna malt
2.75 lbs. (1.25 kg) Briess Ashburne® mild malt
1 lb. (0.45 kg) Munich malt (10 °L)
0.75 lb. (0.34 kg) crystal malt (90 °L)
0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) crystal malt (10 °L)
4 oz. (113 g) crystal malt (45 °L)
4 oz. (113 g) crystal malt (120 °L)
3.25 AAU Nugget hops (60 min.) (0.25 oz./7 g at 13% alpha acids)
5.5 AAU Cascade hops (30 min.) (1 oz./28 g at 5.5% alpha acids)
Wyeast 1098 (British Ale) or White Labs WLP007 (Dry English Ale) yeast
2/3 cup (133 g) dextrose (if priming)

Step by Step
Mill the grains and mix with 4 gallons (15 L) of 165 °F (74 °C) strike water to reach a mash temperature of 152 °F (67 °C). Hold this temperature for 60 minutes. Vorlauf until your runnings are clear, and lauter. Sparge the grains with 2.9 gallons (11 L) and top up as necessary to obtain 6 gallons (23 L) of wort. Boil for 60 minutes, adding hops according to the ingredient list and Irish moss as desired. Chill to 66 °F (19 °C), aerate, and pitch yeast. Ferment at 67 °F (19 °C) for the first three days, then allow temperature to rise to 70 °F (21 °C). Hold there until fermentation is complete (1.015 specific gravity, about ten days after fermentation begins). Once the beer completes fermentation, bottle or keg and carbonate to approximately 2.25 volumes. You may want to cold-crash the beer prior to packaging to 35 °F (2 °C) for 48 hours to improve clarity. Store carbonated beer at near-freezing temperatures for at least two weeks before drinking.

Extract with grains option:
Substitute the Maris Otter pale malt, Vienna malt, Briess Ashburne® mild malt, and Munich malt in the all-grain recipe with 1 lb. (0.45 kg) light dried malt extract, 3.3 lbs. (1.5 kg) Briess Goldpils Vienna liquid malt extract, and 3 lbs. (1.4 kg) Munich liquid malt extract. Bring 5.4 gallons (20.4 L) of water to approximately 162 °F (72 °C) and steep specialty malts in grain bags for 15 minutes. Remove grains, drain, and then add malt extracts and stir until completely dissolved. Boil for 60 minutes. Follow the remaining portion of the all-grain recipe.

OG = 1.069  FG = 1.013
IBU = 60  SRM = 6  ABV = 7.2%

Odell Brewing Company, in Fort Collins, Colorado brews the majority of its beers on a 50-barrel system, however brewers still put to use a 5-barrel pilot system at the brewery every week. This recipe (not to be confused with their seasonal imperial peach IPA Tree Shaker) was one of those pilot batches made available at the tasting room.

Ingredients
11.7 lbs. (5.3 kg) pale ale malt (3 °L)
1.7 lbs. (0.77 kg) Vienna malt (3.5 °L)
0.7 lb. (0.32 kg) melanoidin malt (25 °L)
2 tsp. gypsum
4 lbs. (1.8 kg) peach puree or crushed peaches (pits removed)
7.8 AAU Warrior® hops (60 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 15.5% alpha acids)
7.8 AAU Warrior® hops (30 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 15.5% alpha acids)
8.8 AAU Simcoe® hops (0 min.) (0.8 oz./22 g at 11% alpha acids)
4.8 AAU Australian Summer hops (0 min.) (0.8 oz./22 g at 6% alpha acids)
3.2 AAU Crystal hops (0 min.) (0.8 oz./22 g at 4% alpha acids)
1.2 oz. (33 g) Simcoe® hops (20 min. into hop stand)
1.2 oz. (33 g) Australian Summer hops (20 min. into hop stand)
1.2 oz. (33 g) Crystal hops (20 min. into hop stand)
1.2 oz. (33 g) Simcoe® hops (dry hop)
1.2 oz. (33 g) Australian Summer hops (dry hop)
1.2 oz. (33 g) Crystal hops (dry hop)
0.5 tsp. yeast nutrients (10 min.)
White Labs WLP001 (California Ale) or Wyeast 1056 (American Ale) or Fermentis Safale US-05 yeast
2/3 cup (133 g) dextrose (if priming)

Step by Step
Adjust brewing water by adding 1 tsp. gypsum per 5 gallons (19 L) water. Mash in with 1.5 qts. (1.4 L) strike water per pound (0.45 kg) of grist to achieve a mash temperature of 152 °F (67 °C) and hold for 60 minutes. Sparge with 172 °F (78 °C) water and collect 6 gallons (23 L) in the kettle. Boil for 60 minutes, adding hops and yeast nutrients at times indicated. At the end of the boil add "0 min." hops and stir wort to create a whirlpool. Stir for at least a minute and then let wort settle for a total of 20 minutes. Chill the wort to 170 °F (77 °C) before adding the "hop stand" hops. Stir for at least a minute, then let settle for another 15 minutes. Chill the wort to 68 °F (20 °C) and aerate thoroughly. Hold at 68 °F (20 °C) for three days or until primary fermentation slows down. Add the peach puree after kräusen has fallen then wait until fermentation calms back down before adding dry hops. After five days on the dry hops, rack the beer to a keg and carbonate or rack to bottling bucket, add priming sugar and bottle. Carbonate to 2.4 volumes CO2.

Partial mash option:
Substitute the pale ale malt in the all-grain recipe with 8 lbs. (3.6 kg) pale ale liquid malt extract (7 °L). Place crushed grains in a muslin bag and mash in with 1 gallon (4 L) water to achieve a mash temperature of 152 °F (67 °C) and hold for 60 minutes. Wash grain bag with 1-gallon (4 L) hot water. Top kettle to 6 gallons (23 L) water and boil. Once at a boil, remove the kettle from heat and add the malt extract and gypsum. Stir until all the malt extract is dissolved, then return the wort to a boil. Follow the remaining portion of the all-grain recipe.

(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.063 FG = 1.013
IBU = 37 SRM = 8 ABV = 6.6%

Ingredients
11 lbs (5 kg) 2-row pale ale malt
2 lbs (0.91 kg) Munich malt
7 AAU Cascade hops (60 min.) (1 oz./28 g at 7% alpha acids)
20 AAU whole leaf Centennial hops, ground (0 min.) (2 oz./56 g at 10% alpha acids)
26 AAU whole leaf Citra® hops, ground (0 min.) (2 oz./56 g at 13% alpha acids)
26 AAU whole leaf Simcoe® hops, ground (0 min.) (2 oz./56 g at 13% alpha acids)
Wyeast 1056 (American Ale) or White Labs WLP001 (California Ale) or Safale US-05 or Lallemand BRY-97 (West Coast Ale) yeast
¾ cup (150 g) corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Start off by grinding up the flameout hops. Mill the grains, then mix with 4.1 gallons (15.4 L) of 164 °F (73 °C) strike water to reach a mash temperature of 152 °F (67 °C). Make any adjustments needed for a mash pH of 5.2–5.4. Hold this temperature for 60 minutes. This is a good time to begin milling your hops that will be used at the end of the boil.

Vorlauf until your runnings are clear, and begin your sparge. Sparge the grains with 5 gallons (19 L) and top up as necessary to obtain 6.5 gallons (25 L) of wort. Boil for 60 minutes, adding hops at the times indicated. Add Irish moss or Whirlfloc if needed.

After the boil and whirlpool, rapidly chill the wort to slightly below fermentation temperature, which is 65 °F (18 °C) for this beer. Pitch yeast.

Maintain fermentation temperature of 65 °F (18 °C) for ten days or until the completion of primary fermentation, whichever is later. Then, reduce temperature close to 32 °F (0 °C), and bottle or keg the beer and carbonate to approximately 2.5 volumes.

(5 gallons/19 L, extract with grains)
OG = 1.063 FG = 1.014
IBU = 37 SRM = 8 ABV = 6.5%

Ingredients
6 lbs. (2.61 kg) extra light dried malt extract
1 lb. (0.45 kg) Munich dried malt extract
7 AAU Cascade hops (60 min.) (1 oz./28 g at 7% alpha acids)
20 AAU whole leaf Centennial hops, ground (0 min.) (2 oz./56 g at 10% alpha acids)
26 AAU whole leaf Citra® hops, ground (0 min.) (2 oz./56 g at 13% alpha acids)

¾ cup (150 g) corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Start off by grinding up the flameout hops. Next bring 5 gallons (19 L) of water to a near-boil before adding both dried extracts while stirring. Stir until completely dissolved. Boil for 60 minutes, adding hops at the indicated times left in the boil. Add Irish moss or Whirlfloc as directed, if desired.

Follow the remainder of the all-grain recipe for fermentation and packaging instuctions.

Tips for Success:
From a 30,000 foot view, take your favorite APA recipe and fresh grind all of your flameout & whirlpool hop additions. High quality, fresh, aromatic whole hops are an absolute must in this beer. Grind them at a minimum the same day that you decide to brew (preferably with a grinder that has multiple blades such as Ninja® or Magic Bullet type of mixer/blender); you could even grind while heating your brewing water or mashing in order to same time. Secondly, even in a hop-forward beer like Rupture, you shouldn’t forget to provide a solid malt backbone to allow the hops to springboard off. Finally, Odell doesn’t need to treat their water to brew Rupture but you should aim for a balanced water profile in general especially in regards to sulfate:chloride ratios.

Odell Brewing's Cutthroat Porter clone
Odell Brewing Company: Cutthroat Porter
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.052  FG = 1.017
IBU = 43  SRM = 36  ABV = 4.5%

This London-style porter was named after Colorado's state fish – the Cutthroat Trout – and features a warm, rich color and roasty malt flavors.

Ingredients
9 lbs. (4.1 kg) 2-row pale ale malt
8 oz. (227 g) caramalt
6 oz. (170 g) crystal malt (40 °L)
4 oz. (113 g) amber or brown malt
4 oz. (113 g) Munich malt
8 oz. (227 g) chocolate malt
2 oz. (57 g) roasted barley
0.07 oz. (2 g) gypsum
0.04 oz. (1 g) calcium carbonate
11.25 AAU Fuggle hops (60 min.) (2.5 oz./71 g at 4.5% alpha acids)
0.5 oz. (14 g) Kent Golding hops (1 min.)
0.25 oz. (7 g) Kent Golding hops (1 min.)
0.25 oz. (7 g) Northern Brewer hops (0 min.)
1 pkg. of your favorite ale yeast (not an estery strain)
7/8 cup (175 g) dextrose (if priming)

Step by Step
Mill all the grains and mash with the gypsum and calcium carbonate to achieve a 155 °F (68 °C) mash temperature. You will need 3.4 gallons (13 L) of strike water at around 166 °F (74 °C) to do this. Let the mash rest for 40 minutes. Recirculate until the drawn off wort is fairly clear. Sparge with 170 °F (77 ºC) water. Bring wort to a boil, starting at a level of 5.8 gallons (22 L). Boil 60 minutes, adding hops as directed. Chill the wort, aerate, pitch yeast, and ferment at the appropriate temperature for your favorite ale yeast. Once fermentation is complete, chill the beer to as close to 36 °F (2 °C) as you can and age for 10–14 days. Bottle or keg and enjoy.

Extract with grains option:
Substitute the 2-row pale malt in the all-grain recipe with 2 lbs. 6 oz. (1.1 kg) Muntons light dried malt extract and 3.3 lbs. (1.5 kg) Muntons light liquid malt extract. Place crushed grains in a nylon steeping bag and steep at 155 °F (68 °C) in 3 qts. (2.8 L) of water for 45 minutes. Rinse grains with 1.5 qts. (1.4 L) of water at 170 °F (77 °C).

(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.032  FG = 1.005
IBU = 30  SRM = 7  ABV = 3.3%

This beer is brewed using the second runnings from a batch of Old Foghorn. Estimating the efficiency in such a scenario is quite challenging so be prepared to make some gravity adjustments upwards with dried malt extract or downwards by dumping some wort and topping off with water.

Ingredients
22.5 lbs. (10.2 kg) 2-row pale malt
5 lbs. 3 oz. (2.4 kg) caramel malt (40 °L)
5.9 AAU US Golding pellet hops (60 min.) (0.9 oz./26 g at 6.5% alpha acids)
2.6 AAU US Golding pellet hops (30 min.) (0.4 oz./11 g at 6.5% alpha acids)
White Labs WLP051 (California Ale V) or Wyeast 1272 (American Ale II) yeast
0.2 oz. (6 g) gypsum (optional if using very low mineral water)
2⁄3 cup (133 g) dextrose (if priming)

Step by Step
Start with the spent grain bed in the mash tun from a batch of Old Foghorn (recipe on page 67). Sparge with 6 gallons (22.7 L) of 168 °F (75 °C) water and top up with water if necessary to obtain 6 gallons (23 L) of 1.027 SG wort. Add the optional gypsum (see ingredients list) and boil for 60 minutes, adding hops according to the ingredients list. After the boil, turn off the heat and chill the wort to slightly below fermentation temperature, about 65 °F (18 °C). Aerate the wort with pure oxygen or filtered air and pitch the yeast. Ferment at 67 °F (19 °C) for 4 days. Add dry hops and raise to 72 °F (22 °C) for three days. Once at terminal gravity (approximately 7 days total) bottle or keg the beer and carbonate.

Extract with grains option:
Small Beer is brewed using the parti-gyle method of brewing. Because this requires that the wort be made with grains, a true parti-gyle brewed with extract is not possible. This recipe is provided simply for extract brewers who are interested in brewing Anchor Small Beer independently.

Substitute the 2-row pale malt and caramel malt in the all-grain recipe with 3 lbs. (1.36 kg) light dried malt extract and 1 lb. 3 oz. (0.54 kg) caramel malt (40 °L). Place the milled grains in a muslin bag and steep in 4 quarts (3.8 L) of 149 °F (65 °C) water for 15 minutes. Remove the grain and rinse with 1 gallon (3.8 L) of hot water. Add water and optional gypsum (see ingredients list) to reach a volume of 5.25 gallons (19.9 L) and heat to boiling. Turn off the heat, add the liquid malt extract, and stir until completely dissolved. Top up with water if necessary to obtain 6 gallons (23 L) of 1.027 SG wort. Follow the remaining portion of the all-grain recipe.

Odell Brewing Co.'s Double Pilsner clone
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.076 FG = 1.017
IBU = 37 SRM = 4 ABV = 8.2%

Like a double IPA, this is a amped up version of a Pilsner from Odell Brewing.

Ingredients
14.5 lbs. (6.6 kg) German Pilsner malt
1 lb. (0.45 kg) Weyermann Carafoam® malt (2 °L)
4 oz. (113 g) Munich malt (10 °L)
10 AAU Saaz hops (60 min.) (2.9 oz./81 g at 3.5% alpha acids)
5.7 AAU Tettnang hops (1 min.) (1.5 oz./43 g at 3.8% alpha acids)
5.7 AAU Tettnang hops (0 min.) (1.5 oz./43 g at 3.8% alpha acids)
1 tsp Irish moss (15 min.)
Wyeast 2206 (Bavarian Lager) or White Labs WLP820 (Octoberfest/ Märzen) yeast (4 qt./4 L starter)
¾ cup (150 g) dextrose (if priming)

Step by Step
Use water with a low mineral content. Mash crushed grains with 5 gallons (19 L) of mash water, heated to 162 °F (72 °C). Mash at 150–152 °F (66–67 °C) for 45 minutes. Recirculate wort until it is quite clear. Collect wort, sparging with 168 °F (76 °C) water to collect 6.5 gallons (25 L) of wort. (Your SG here should be 1.058. If it’s lower than this, add dried malt to reach 1.058 or collect more wort — up to 8 gallons/30 L — and boil longer). Boil wort for 90 minutes, adding the hops at times indicated. At the end of the boil, turn off heat, add the final hop addition and stir the wort to create a whirlpool. Allow the wort to settle for 10 minutes. Cool wort, transfer to fermenter and aerate well. Pitch yeast sediment from yeast starter. Ferment beer at 55 °F (13 °C). Hold fermentation temperature until beer is finished fermenting. Chill to 34 °F (1.1 °C) and hold for at least a month. Prime bottles with sugar or keg.

Extract with grains option:
Reduce the German Pilsner malt in the all-grain recipe to 0.75 lb. (0.34 kg) and add 2 lbs. (0.91 kg) Briess extra light dried malt extract and 6.6 lbs. (3 kg) Briess Pilsen liquid malt extract. Put crushed grains in a nylon steeping bag. In a large soup pot, heat 3 qts. (2.8 L) of water to 162 °F (72 °C) and submerge bag. Steep grains at 150–152 °F (66–67 °C) for 45 minutes. While grains are steeping, bring 2.5 gallons (9.5 L) of water to a boil in your brewpot. After steep, put colander over brewpot and place grain bag in it. Pour "grain tea" through grain bag (to filter out the "floaties"), then rinse grains with 1.5 quarts (1.4 L) of water at 170 °F (77 °C). Add dried malt extract and boil wort for 60 minutes, adding hops at times indicated. Add liquid malt extract at the end of the boil and let it steep for 15 minutes before cooling. Top off to 5 gallons (19 L). Follow the remaining portion of the all-grain recipe.

Orval pours orange-brown with a big, rocky head. The very spritzy levels of carbonation with a slight sour note and distinctive Brett character make the beer feel prickly on the tongue. Orval is dry and has little hop bitterness or flavor, although it is the only Trappist ale to be dry hopped. This recipe creates a beer similar to the Orval beer distributed to the US with a higher ABV.

Ingredients
8.5 lbs. (3.8 kg) Pilsner malt
1.3 lbs. (0.6 kg) English light crystal malt (40 °L)
2.2 lbs. (1 kg) candi syrup (1 °L)
4.4 AAU Hallertau-Hersbrücker hops (60 min.) (1.1 oz./31 g of 4% alpha acids)
3.3 AAU Styrian Goldings hops (60 min.) (0.66 oz./19 g of 5% alpha acids)
2.5 AAU Styrian Goldings hops (15 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g of 5% alpha acids)
0.3 oz. (8 g) Strisselspalt whole cone hops (dry hop)
0.25 oz. (7 g) Hallertau-Hersbrücker whole cone hops (dry hop)
1⁄4 tsp. yeast nutrients
White Labs WLP510 (Bastogne Belgian Ale) or Wyeast 3522 (Belgian Ardennes) or LalBrew Abbaye Belgian Ale yeast
Wyeast 3112 (Brettanomyces bruxellensis) or White Labs WLP650 (Brettanomyces bruxellensis) yeast
1 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Heat 3.6 gallons (13.5 L) of water to 163 °F (73 °C), stir in crushed grains and mash at 150 °F (65 °C). Mash for 60 minutes raise grain bed temperature to 162 °F (72 °C). Hold for 15 minutes. Recirculate until wort is clear, then begin running wort off to kettle. Sparge with 170 °F (77 °C) water to collect roughly 7 gallons (26.5 L). Boil wort for 90 minutes, adding hops as indicated. Add yeast nutrients with 15 minutes left in boil and candi syrup at the end of boil. Cool wort down to 59 °F (15 °C), aerate, and pitch the Belgian yeast strain. Fermentation temperature can be slowly raised up to 72 °F (22 °C) to finish. Rack to secondary when active fermentation is complete and add Brettanomyces and dry hops. Let condition for 3 weeks at 59 °F (15 °C) before bottling. Condition warm for 3 weeks in bottles before serving.

2.8 AAU German Northern Brewer hops (60 min.) (0.33 oz./9.2 g of 8.5% alpha acid)
2.4 AAU German Northern Brewer hops (30 min.) (0.25 oz./7 g of 8.5% alpha acid)
White Labs WLP029 (German Ale/Kölsch) or Wyeast 2565 (Kölsch) yeast
O.75 cup of corn sugar (for priming)

Step by Step
Steep the 3 crushed malts in 3 gallons (11 L) of water at 155 ºF (68 ºC) for 30 minutes. Remove grains from wort, add the malt syrup and dry malt extract and bring to a boil. Add the first addition of Northern Brewer hops, Irish moss and boil for 60 minutes. Add the last addition of Northern Brewer hops for the last 30 minutes of the boil. There are no finishing hops in this recipe. Now add wort to 2 gallons (7.6 L) cool water in a sanitary fermenter, and top off with cool water to 5.5 gallons (20.9 L). Cool the wort to 75 ºF (24 ºC), aerate the beer and pitch your yeast. Allow the beer to cool over the next few hours to 65 ºF (18 ºC), and hold at this temperature until the beer has finished fermenting. Add the chocolate and cherry flavors to the beer on bottling day when you add the priming sugar. Then bottle and enjoy!

All-grain option:
This is a single step infusion mash. Your grain bill will be 6.33 lbs. (2.9 kg) pale 2-row malt, 2.75 lbs. (1.2 kg) wheat malt, 9 oz. (252 g) dextrin malt, 9 oz. (252 g) crystal malt (40 ºL), and 5.0 oz. (0.14 kg) chocolate malt. Mash crushed grains at 156 ºF (69 ºC) for 60 minutes. Collect enough wort to boil for 90 minutes and have a 5.5-gallon (21-L) yield (about 7 gallons/26 L).

14 oz. (400 g) British light crystal malt (20 °L)
1 oz. (30 g) British medium crystal malt (60 °L)
1.4 oz. (40 g) black malt (500 °L)
2 oz. (57 g) treacle (100 °L)
5 oz. (140 g) invert sugar
1.1 AAU Fuggle hops (60 min.) (0.25 oz./7 g at 4.5% alpha acids)
2.2 AAU Fuggle hops (60 min.) (0.2 oz./6 g at 11% alpha acids)
0.15 oz. (4 g) Fuggle hops (5 min.)
0.15 oz. (4 g) East Kent Golding hops (5 min.)
1 Whirlfloc tablet (10 min.)
Safale S-04 or White Labs WLP002 (English Ale) or Wyeast 1968 (London ESB Ale)
1⁄2 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Mill the grains and dough-in, targeting a mash of around 1.25 quarts of water to 1 pound of grain (2.6 L/kg) and a temperature of 156 °F (68 °C). Hold the mash at 156 °F (68 °C) until enzymatic conversion is complete, about 60 minutes. Sparge slowly with 170 °F (77 °C) water, collecting wort until the pre-boil kettle volume is 6.5 gallons (24.6 L).

Total boil time is 60 minutes. Add hops and Whirlfloc tablet as indicated. Chill the wort to 65–68 °F (18–20 °C) and aerate thoroughly. There should be 5.5 gallons (21 L) of wort in the fermenter. Pitch 1-quart (1-L) yeast starter if using liquid yeast or a package of dried yeast.

Carbonate the beer to around 1.5–2 volumes of CO2 if kegging or bottling. If using casks, you may consider transferring two days after fermentation begins, being sure to take as little trub into the pin or firkin as possible.

Safale S-04 or White Labs WLP002 (English Ale) or Wyeast 1968 (London ESB Ale)
1⁄2 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Place crushed grains into a muslin bag. Heat 4 gallons (15.2 L) water to 160 °F (71 °C) with the grains submerged. Remove the grains and the pot from heat. Add the liquid malt extract in the brewpot, dissolving completely before adding heat again. Then top off with water to 6.5 gallons (25 L).

Total boil time is 60 minutes. Add hops and Whirlfloc tablet as indicated. Chill the wort to 65–68 °F (18–20 °C) and aerate thoroughly. There should be 5.5 gallons (21 L) of wort in the fermenter. Pitch 1-quart (1-L) yeast starter if using liquid yeast or a package of dried yeast.

Carbonate the beer to around 1.5–2 volumes of CO2 if kegging or bottling. If using casks, you may consider transferring two days after fermentation begins, being sure to take as little trub into the pin or firkin as possible.

Tips for Success:
The water used at Okell’s is soft, so they Burtonize their water with salts for best results in the Mild. The beer should be ready to drink only a few days after fermentation is complete, adding necessary time for bottle conditioning or keg carbonation. If kegging, I’d suggest natural carbonation in the keg.

Ingredients
4.0 lbs. (1.8 kg) British pale ale malt
8.0 oz. (0.23 kg) crystal malt (60 °L)
2.0 oz. (57 g) crystal malt (120 °L)

0.5 oz. (14 g) Fuggles whole hops (dry hop)
Wyeast 1028 (London Ale) or White Labs WLP026 (Burton Ale) yeast
(2 qt./2 L yeast starter)

Step by Step
Mash pale malt at 153 °F (67 °C) for 45 minutes in 7.8 qts. (7.5 L) of water. Sparge grains to yield just short of 2.5 gallons (9.5 L) of wort. While mashing, steep specialty grains in 2 qts. (~2 L) of water in your brewpot at 153 °F (67 °C). Add wort from partial mash to steeping liquid in your brewpot and add roughly one third of the malt extract. Boil wort for 75 minutes, adding hops at times indicated. Add sugars and remaining malt extract for final 15 minutes of boil. Cool wort and transfer to fermenter. Top up to 5 gallons (19 L) with cool water and pitch yeast. Ferment at 68 °F (20 °C). After primary fermentation has ceased, let beer set for 3 days, then rack to secondary and add dry hops. Dry hop for 2 weeks.

Extract with Grains Option:
Reduce amount of pale ale malt to 0.75 lbs. (0.34 kg) and use a total of 6.75 lbs. (3.1 kg) light dried malt extract. Steep grains at 152 °F (67 °C). Add roughly one half of the malt extract and boil wort for 75 minutes, adding hops at times indicated. Add sugars and remaining malt extract for final 15 minutes of boil. Cool wort and transfer to fermenter. Top up to 5 gallons (19 L) with cool water and pitch yeast. Ferment at 68 °F (20 °C). After primary fermentation has ceased, let beer set for 3 days, then rack to secondary and add dry hops. Dry hop for 2 weeks. Age for 6 months.

Tips for Success:
The partial-mash fomulation of this beer utilizes steeped specialty grains (in the brewpot) and a separate small mash. This beer is a darker, stronger and more bitter interpretation of Theakston’s Old Peculiar. It gets its name from Cthulhu — a central character (one of the Old Ones) in H. P. Lovecraft’s writings. For best results, make a 2-qt. (2-L) yeast starter and pitch the yeast from this. This is underpitching, compared to the optimal pitching rate, but is done intentionally to help the yeast develop an estery character that is appropriate for this beer.

(5 gallons/19 L, partial mash)
OG = 1.056 FG = 1.014
IBU = 29 SRM = 11 ABV = 5.5%

Ingredients
3.3 lbs. (1.5 kg) Muntons light, unhopped, liquid malt extract
2 lb. (0.9 kg) light dried malt extract
2 lb. (0.9 kg) 2 row pale malt
11 oz. (0.31 kg) carastan malt (35 °L)
3 oz. (85 g) peat-smoked malt
1.5 oz. (43 g) crystal malt (150 °L)
1 oz. (28 g) roast barley (450 °L)
8.1 AAU Centennial hop pellets (45 mins) (0.85 oz./ 24 g of 9.5% alpha acids)
1/2 tsp. yeast nutrient (15 min.)
1/2 tsp. Irish moss (15 min.)
White Labs WLP 013 (London Ale) or Wyeast 1968 (London ESB) yeast
0.75 cup (150 g) corn sugar (for priming)

Step by Step
Steep the crushed grain in 2 gallons (7.6 L) of water at 154 ºF (68 ºC) for 30 minutes. Remove grains from the wort and rinse with 2 quarts (1.8 L) of hot water. Add the liquid malt extract and boil for 90 minutes. While boiling, add the hops, Irish moss and yeast nutrient as per the schedule. During the boil, use this time to thoroughly sanitize a fermenter. Now add the wort to 2 gallons (7.6 L) of cold water in the sanitized fermenter and top off with cold water up to 5 gallons (19 L). Cool the wort to 75 ºF (24 ºC). Pitch your yeast and aerate the wort heavily. Allow the beer to cool to 66 ºF (19 ºC). Hold at that temperature until fermentation is complete. Transfer to a carboy, avoiding any splashing to prevent aerating the beer. Allow the beer condition for one week and then bottle or keg. Allow the beer to carbonate and age for two weeks.

All-grain option: This is a single step infusion mash using a total of 11 lbs. (5 kg) 2-row pale malt. Mix the crushed grains with 3.75 gallons (14 L) of 168 °F (76 °C) water to stabilize at 154 ºF (68 ºC) for 60 minutes. Sparge slowly with 175 ºF (79 ºC) water. Collect approximately 6 gallons (23 L) of wort runoff to boil for 90 minutes. Reduce the single hop addition to 0.75 oz.( 21g) Centennial hop pellets (7.1 AAU) to allow for the higher utilization factor of a full wort boil. The remainder of this recipe and procedures are the same as the extract with grain recipe.
* Brewers note: if you use soft or bottled water add 1 tsp. of "brewing salts" the last 10 minutes of the boil. A cooler fermentation is recommended to reduce ester production.

0.3 oz. (8 g) gypsum (optional if using very low mineral water)
2⁄3 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Mill the grains and mix with 4.7 gallons (17.8 L) of 158 °F (70 °C) strike water and optional gypsum (see ingredients list) to reach a mash temperature of 149 °F (65 °C). Hold this temperature for 60 minutes. Vorlauf until your runnings are clear. Sparge the grains with 2.8 gallons (10.6 L) of 168 °F (75 °C) water and top up with water to obtain 6 gallons (23 L) of 1.049 specific gravity wort. Boil for 60 minutes, adding hops according to the ingredients list.

After the boil, turn off the heat and chill the wort to slightly below fermentation temperature, about 65 °F (18 °C). Aerate the wort with pure oxygen or filtered air and pitch yeast. Ferment at 67 °F (19 °C) for four days. Add the dry hops and raise to 72 °F (22 °C) for three days. Once the beer reaches terminal gravity (approximately seven days total) bottle or keg the beer and carbonate.

Ingredients
8 lbs. 3 oz. (3.7 kg) golden liquid malt extract
4.1 AAU Cascade pellet hops (60 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 8.2% alpha acids)
6.2 AAU Cascade pellet hops (45 min.) (0.75 oz./21 g at 8.2% alpha acids)
0.5 oz. (14 g) Cascade pellet hops (0 min.)
1 oz. (28 g) Cascade pellet hops (dry hop)
White Labs WLP051 (California Ale V) or Wyeast 1272 (American Ale II) yeast
0.2 oz. (6 g) gypsum (optional if using very low mineral water)
2⁄3 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Bring 5.4 gallons (20.4 L) of water and optional gypsum (see ingredients list) to boil, turn off the flame, and stir in the liquid malt extract until completely dissolved. Top up with water if necessary to obtain 6 gallons (23 L) of 1.049 specific gravity wort.

Boil for 60 minutes, adding hops according to the ingredients list. After the boil, turn off the heat and chill the wort to slightly below fermentation temperature, about 65 °F (18 °C). Aerate the wort with pure oxygen or filtered air and pitch the yeast.

Ferment at 67 °F (19 °C) for four days. Add the dry hops and raise to 72 °F (22 °C) for three days. Once the beer reaches terminal gravity (approximately seven days total) bottle or keg the beer and carbonate.

Tips for Success:
Anchor’s ales spend three days in open fermentation and the temperatures are allowed to ramp over that time. If you want to do an open fermentation at home, focus on producing extremely sanitary wort, cleaning and sanitizing everything the wort comes in contact with, and pitching a known pure and viable yeast strain. A fermentation vessel such as a bucket can be used, and if you’re paranoid about contamination from fruit flies you can stretch some cheesecloth over the top. To replicate Anchor’s process you would rack to a closed vessel with an airlock such as a carboy after three to four days and do any dry hopping there.

IBU = 30 SRM = 11 ABV = 3.8%

While the gravity and ABV might lead you to think this is a watery beer, it is not. Mashing in relatively warm and the addition of crystal malts make for a nice mouthfeel. The low ABV makes it an easy beer to enjoy pint after pint. And that’s the way it is meant to be.

Ingredients
7.5 lbs. (3.4 kg) Golden Promise or Crisp pale malt
4 oz. (113 g) British light crystal malt (10 °L)
4 oz. (113 g) British medium crystal malt (55 °L)
3 oz. (85 g) chocolate malt (340 °L)
2.5 AAU East Kent Golding hops (40 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 5% alpha acids)
6 AAU English Challenger hops (40 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 12% alpha acids)
2.5 AAU East Kent Golding hops (10 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 5% alpha acids)
6 AAU English Challenger hops (10 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 12% alpha acids)
1 Whirlfloc tablet (10 min.)
White Labs WLP005 (British Ale) or Wyeast 1098 (British Ale) or Wyeast 1026 (British Cask Ale) or Safale F-2 yeast
1⁄2 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Mill the grains and dough-in, targeting a mash of around 1.25 quarts of water to 1 pound of grain (2.6 L/kg) and a temperature of 156 °F (68 °C). Hold the mash at 156 °F (68 °C) until enzymatic conversion is complete. Sparge slowly with 170 °F (77 °C) water, collecting wort until the pre-boil kettle volume is 6.25 gallons (23.7 L).

Total boil time is 60 minutes. Add hops and Whirlfloc tablet as indicated. Chill the wort to 65 °F (18 °C) and aerate thoroughly. Pitch 1-quart (1-L) yeast starter if using liquid yeast or a package of dried yeast.

Carbonate the beer to around 1.5–2 volumes of CO2 if kegging or bottling. If using casks, you may consider transferring two days after fermentation begins, being sure to take as little trub into the pin or firkin as possible.

(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.051 FG = 1.012
IBU = 20 SRM = 15 ABV = 5%

Ingredients
11 lbs. (5 kg) German dark Munich malt (10 °L)
2 oz. (57 g) Weyermann Carafa® Special II malt
3.75 AAU Magnum pellet hops (60 min.) (0.25 oz./7 g at 15% alpha acids)
2.25 AAU Tettnanger hops (20 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 4.5% alpha acids)
Wyeast 2124 (Bohemian Lager), White Labs WLP830 (German Lager), or SafLager W-34/70 yeast
3⁄4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
This is a single infusion mash. Heat 16.7 qts. (15.8 L) of water, add 1 tsp. of calcium chloride. Mash grains for 60 minutes at 152 °F (67 °C). Sparge with enough water to collect 6.5 gallons (25 L) of wort in the kettle. Bring wort to a boil and boil for 60 minutes, adding hops according to the recipe above. Add a kettle coagulant of your choice if you so desire.

After the boil is complete, give the wort a long stir to create a whirlpool and let settle for 10 minutes, then begin to chill. Bring down to yeast-pitching temperature, aerate the wort, and pitch the yeast.

Fermentation temperature can vary depending on your fermentation control. You can ferment from about 55–65 °F (13–18 °C). Ferment for 1–2 weeks at this temperature, Transfer to a secondary and lager for 1–4 weeks at 33–35 °F (0–2 °C). Bottle or force carbonate per normal.

Extract brewers: Swap out the dark Munich malt with 5.6 lbs. (2.5 kg) of Munich dried malt extract. Soak the crushed Carafa® in a small grain bag as the water heats up to a boil. Off heat, stir in the extract just prior to hitting a boil and stir until fully dissolved then bring the wort to a boil. Follow the remaining instructions from the all-grain recipe.

OG = 1.054 (13.4°P) FG = 1.014 (3.6°P)
IBU = 23 SRM = 20 ABV = 5.3%

Ingredients
11 lb. (5 kg) Durst or Weyermann Munich Malt (8 °L)
5 oz. (143 g) Weyermann Carafa® Special II (huskless) (430 °L)
4 AAU Hallertauer pellet hops (1 oz./28 g at 4% alpha acids) (60 min.)
2 AAU Hallertauer pellet hops (0.50 oz./14 g at 4% alpha acids) (20 min.)
White Labs WLP833 (German Bock Lager), Wyeast 2308 (Munich Lager) or Fermentis Saflager S-23 yeast

Step by Step
Mill the grains and dough-in targeting a mash of around 1.5 quarts of water to 1 pound of grain (a liquor-to-grist ratio of about 3:1 by weight) and a temperature of 154 °F (68 °C). Hold the mash at 154 °F (68 °C) until enzymatic conversion is complete. Infuse the mash with near boiling water while stirring or with a recirculating mash system raise the temperature to mash out at 168 °F (76 °C). Sparge slowly with 170 °F (77 °C) water, collecting wort until the pre-boil kettle volume is around 5.9 gallons (22.3 L) and the gravity is 1.046 (11.44 °P).

Once the wort is boiling, add the bittering hops. The total wort boil time is 1 hour after adding the bittering hops. Add the flavor hops with 20 minutes left in the boil. Add Irish moss or other kettle finings with 15 minutes left in the boil. Chill the wort rapidly to 50 °F (10 °C), let the break material settle, rack to the fermenter, pitch the yeast and aerate.

Ferment around 50 °F (10 °C) until the yeast drops clear. With healthy yeast, fermentation should be complete in two weeks or less, but don’t rush it. If desired, perform a diacetyl rest during the last 1⁄3 of fermentation. Rack to a keg and force carbonate or rack to a bottling bucket, add priming sugar and bottle. Target a carbonation level of 2 to 2.5 volumes. A month or more of cold conditioning at near freezing temperatures will mellow some of the flavors. Serve at 43 to 46 °F (6 to 8 °C).

OG = 1.052 FG = 1.015
IBU = 18 SRM = 18 ABV = 5%

Ingredients:
1/2 lb. (0.23 kg) dark crystal malt (80 °L)
1/4 lb. (113 g) peat-smoked malt
1/4 lb. (113 g) roasted barley
7 lbs. (3.2 kg) light liquid malt extract
5 AAU Fuggles hop pellets (60 min.) (1 oz./28 g at 5% alpha acids)
1 tsp. whole cumin seed
1 tsp. whole black pepper
Neutral ale yeast (a liquid culture such as Wyeast 1728 Scottish Ale really emphasizes the smokiness and spiciness of this brew)
2/3 cup brown sugar

Step-by-Step:
Crack and steep the grains, remove when the water hits 170-176 °F (77 - 80 °C). Add extract and Fuggles pellets, boil 60 minutes. Crush the cumin and pepper together. Turn off the heat and add spice blend-don't stir in, but rather let settle on the surface. Let settle for 15 minutes, then begin chilling process. Transfer to fermenter and top off with water to 5.25 gallons (20 L).

Fermentation should be done at 60 °F (16 °C), with a secondary cellaring at 50 °F (10 °C), then bottled as normal (use brown sugar). Age six weeks for best blending of flavors and mellowing of the smokiness.

(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.070 FG = 1.018–1.025
IBU = 35 SRM = 21 ABV = 5.9–6.9%

Ingredients
12 lb. (5.5 kg) 2-row pale ale malt (for example, Maris Otter)
2.0 lb. (0.9 kg) Munich malt
0.5 lb.(227 g) crystal malt (60 °L)
2.0 oz (57 g) chocolate malt
8.0 AAU Willamette hops (90 min.) (1.45 oz/41 g of 5.5% alpha acid)
1.5 oz (43 g) Willamette hops (0 min.)
White Labs WLP004 (Irish Ale) or Wyeast 1084 (Irish Ale) yeast
0.5 cup corn sugar or DME (priming)

Step by Step
To ensure a good fermentation, it is best to make a half-gallon (2-L) starter of the original yeast culture. Three days before brewday, make starter by boiling 0.50 lb. (0.23 kg) of dried malt extract in 0.50 gallons (2 L) of water.

Use a single-step infusion mash at 153–155 °F (67–68 °C) for 1–1.5 hours. (Use ~4.6 gallons (17 L) of water at 165 °F (74 °C) for mash in.) Sparge for one hour, with water no hotter than 175 °F (80 °C), until run-off reaches SG 1.010–1.012. (Expect to collect around 7.3 gallons (27.6 L), although this can vary considerably depending on your system.)

Boil the wort for 90 minutes, with bittering hops added after the first foamy head subsides. Add flavor hops as the heat is turned off at the end of the boil.

Adjust wort volume with cold water (if needed), and cool to about 70 °F (21 °C). Pitch with yeast starter and allow to ferment. After 5–7 days, final gravity should have been reached; rack into a glass fermenter. One to two weeks later, rack again, prime with dried malt extract or corn sugar, and rack into keg or bottles. Allow beer to condition for at least three months before drinking.

This recipe is our attempt of brewing an American bock similar to that of Hartmann Brewing Co.’s 1904 version.

Ingredients
8.2 lbs. (3.7 kg) Simpsons Best Pale Ale malt
1.5 lbs. (0.68 kg) Simpsons medium crystal malt (65 °L)
3 lbs. (1.4 kg) flaked corn
9.2 AAU Huell Melon hops (60 min.) (1.5 oz./43 g at 6.1% alpha acids)
SafLager S-23 or White Labs WLP820 (Oktoberfest/Märzen Lager) or Wyeast 2206 (Bavarian Lager) yeast
2⁄3 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Mix the grains and flaked corn with 5 gallons (19 L) of water to give a mash temperature of 153 °F (67 °C) and hold for one hour. Run off and sparge to collect 5.5–6 gallons (21–23 L) of wort. Add the hops (and any salts, if needed, to give concentrations of 96 ppm Na+ and 148 ppm Cl-) and boil for 60 minutes.

Cool to 52 °F (11 °C) and pitch two packets of the yeast or an adequately-sized starter if using liquid yeast. Keep at 50–52 °F (10–11 °C) for two weeks, by which time the gravity should be down to 1.010. Then raise the temperature to 60–65 °F (16–18 °C) for two days for a diacetyl rest (not something Hartmann would have done). Then allow to cool gradually to
31 °F (-0.6 °C) for 20 days and put into the serving tank. Keg or bottle in the usual manner.

Olympia has a very clean flavor, a little malt flavor, a little corn flavor and a little rice flavor, with just a bit of citrus from American hops. There is debate whether the "new" version brewed in California is as good as the original version brewed in Olympia, WA.

Ingredients
3.0 lbs. (1.3 kg) light dried malt extract (such as Coopers or Briess)
2.0 lb. (0.91 kg) 6-row pale malt
1.0 lb. (0.45 kg) flaked rice
1 lb. 2 oz. (0.51 kg) corn sugar (5 mins)
2.5 AAU Cascade hop pellets (60 min) (0.50 oz./14 g of 5.0% alpha acid)
1.0 AAU Willamette hop pellets (5 min) (0.25 oz./7 g of 4.0% alpha acid)
1/2 teaspoon Irish moss (last 15 min)
White Labs WLP840 (American Lager) or Wyeast 2035 (American Lager) yeast
1.0 cup (200 g) corn sugar (for priming)

Step by Step
Steep the crushed grains in 1 gallon (3.8 L) of water at 150 °F (65 °C) for 45 minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove grains from the wort and rinse with 2 quarts (1.8 L) of 170 °F (77 °C) water. Add half the dried malt extract and water to make at least 3 gallons (11 L) of wort and boil for 60 minutes, adding the hops and Irish moss per the recipe schedule. For the last 5 minutes of the boil, add the remaining dried malt extract and corn sugar to dissolve it in to the wort. Cool the wort and transfer it to your fermenter, topping up with cold water to 5.0 gallons (19 L). Pitch your yeast when the beer has cooled to 68 °F (20 °C), and aerate. Hold the beer at around 68 °F (20 °C) until the yeast starts fermenting, and then cool the beer to 52 °F (11 °C) for the remainder of the fermentation. About 3 days after hitting your final gravity, raise the temperature of the beer to about 68 °F (20 °C) for 3 days for a diacetyl rest. Transfer to a secondary fermenter and lager the beer at about 35 °F (2 °C) for another 2 weeks before bottling or kegging this beer.

Step by Step
This beer is brewed with a double mash and is diluted upon packaging as all American-style Pilsners are. You ferment 5 gallons (19 L) of base beer, but yield 6 gallons (23 L) in the keg. Reserve a handful of 6-row malt. Mash in remaining malt with 4.1 gallons (16 L) of water at 133 °F (56 °C) and begin mashing at 122 °F (50 °C) in your kettle. Combine rice and corn with the handful of 6-row malt in 1.0 gallon (3.8 L) of water in a large kitchen pot and begin heating it. Rest cereal mash at 158 °F (70 °C) for 5 minutes, then bring to a boil. Boil for 30 minutes, stirring almost constantly. Heat the main mash, stirring often, to 140 °F (60 °C) and hold. Combine cooked corn and rice with main mash and adjust temperature — if needed — to 152 °F (67 °C). Hold at 152 °F (67 °C) for 30 minutes, stirring often. Heat mash to 168 °F (76 °C), stirring often, and transfer mash to lauter tun, recirculate and run off wort. Sparge with water hot enough to keep grain bed at 170 °F (77 °C ). Collect about 5.0 gallons (19 L) of wort, add 1.5 gallons (5.7 L) of water and bring the wort to a vigorous, rolling boil. Boil the wort down to 5.0 gallons (19 L) over 90 minutes, adding hops and Irish moss at times indicated. Cool wort down to 48 °F (8.8 °C) and transfer wort to fermenter. Aerate wort and pitch yeast from starter.

Ferment beer at 52 °F (11 °C), allowing temperature to rise to 60 °F (16 °C) when fermentation is almost finished. Hold for 3 days at this temperature. Separate beer from yeast and cool to 40 °F (4.4 °C). Allow to cold condition (lager) for 4–5 weeks. When you are ready to keg the beer, boil a little over 1.0 gallon (3.8 L) of water for 15 minutes, cool rapidly and add 3.3 qts. (3.2 L) to your 5-gallon (19-L) Corny keg. Transfer beer to keg until it is full. You will be left with 3.3 qts. (3.2 L) of base beer to either dilute to 4 qts. (3.7 L) with boiled and cooled water or to package as "malt liquor."

(7 gallons/26.5 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.074 (pre-souring) FG = 1.025
IBU = 5 ABV = 7%

A full-bodied and thick imperial smoothie style sour showcasing two of the best tropical fruits grown in Australia — mango and passion fruit.

Ingredients
3.3 lbs. (1.5 kg) American pale ale malt
3.3 lbs. (1.5 kg) wheat malt
1.3 lbs. (0.6 kg) flaked wheat
1.3 lbs. (0.6 kg) malted maize
1.3 lbs. (0.6 kg) Simpsons Golden Naked Oats® malt
0.66 lb. (0.3 kg) Carapils® malt
0.66 lb. (0.3 kg) acidulated malt
5 oz. (150 g) light crystal malt
2.2 lbs. (1 kg) dextrose (10 min.)
1/2 Whirlfloc tablet (10 min.)
5 g yeast nutrient (10 min.)
2 sachets Lallemand WildBrew Helveticus Pitch or favorite souring strain

Post-souring ingredients

2.2 lbs. (1 kg) lactose
1.1 lbs. (0.5 kg) wheat dried malt extract
0.88 oz. (25 g) Vic SecretTM hops
8.8. lbs. (4 kg) mango puree
8.8 lbs. (4 kg) passion fruit puree
1/2 Whirlfloc tablet
5 g yeast nutrient
Lalbrew Voss Kveik Ale, Omega Yeast OYL061 (Voss), Imperial Yeast A43 (Loki), or The Yeast Bay WLP4045 (Sigmund’s Voss Kveik) yeast

Step by Step
Please note: This recipe calls for the addition of over 2 gallons (7.6 L) of fruit puree after souring and primary, meaning you will need to account for the extra volume. This recipe uses reverse osmosis (RO) water. Adjust all brewing water to 100 ppm each of chloride and sulfate, a high sodium level of 50 ppm minimum, and medium calcium.

This recipe uses a single infusion mash. Use enough water to target just over 1 qt. per pound of grain or 2.4 L/kg. Target a mash temperature of 149 °F (65 °C) for 60 minutes or until proper enzymatic conversion has occurred. Sparge with water no hotter than 167 °F (75 °C).

Collect enough wort for a 60-minute boil, adding dextrose, nutrient, and finings as indicated. After boil is complete, cool wort to 113 °F (45 °C). Rack into a bucket or another stock pot to get off the break material at the bottom of kettle. Pitch two sachets of Lactobacillus helveticus. Cover and seal kettle or bucket. Aim to maintain a temperature of 104–113 °F (40–45 °C) for 72 hours. Insulate fermenter with blankets if needed.

After 72 hours bring your kettle to a boil for 15 minutes to pasteurize. Add lactose, wheat extract, Whirlfloc, and yeast nutrient and mix thoroughly. After pasteurization step add Vic SecretTM hops and whirlpool for 20 minutes.

Rapidly chill the wort to 95 °F (35 °C) and transfer to the primary fermenter. Aerate thoroughly and pitch plenty of healthy kveik Voss yeast. Ferment at 100 °F (37.5 °C). After 36 hours ramp temperature up to 104 °F (40 °C) and add fruit purees. Spund fermenter to 15 psi if possible. After two days rouse/shake/mix fermenter to mix fruit up. Allow another five days for full fermentation to complete.

Drop to 50 °F (10 °C) and hold for five days. Then drop temperature to 32 °F (0 °C) for two days.

Keg this beer targeting 2.3 vol-umes of CO2. It is not recommended to bottle condition this beer due to the potential dangers caused by yeast fermenting the fruit and causing bottle bombs.

Tips for Success:
Make sure your kettle and cooling equipment is very, very clean before starting the souring process. Trust the process.

Nick says homebrewers can use rice hulls in place of malted maize if they would prefer as they act similarly, however he likes how the malted maize will contribute some extract as well.

If you can, use fresh fruit and puree with seeds/skins removed, freeze, then defrost up to room temperature. There is no need for a "kill step" as there is enough alcohol, acid, and aggressive yeast to ward off any nasties. Soft carbonation will give a creaminess. If you’re feeling adventurous, keep flat and serve with a nitro tap.

Step-by-Step:
Crack and steep the grain in two gallons (7.6 L) of water, remove at 170-176 °F (77-80 °C). Add malt extract and Hallertau pellets, boil 30 minutes. Add Saaz pellets, boil 10 minutes. Add orange peel and spices, boil five minutes and turn off heat. Pour through strainer into your fermenter, topping off to 5.25 gallons (20 L) and proceed with normal fermentation, lagering, and bottling. Age three to four weeks. The orange and spice flavors will be stronger at first but will fade into the background after a month of lagering.

Ancient Fire Mead & Cider’s 60% Of The Time clone
Ancient Fire Mead & Cider’s 60% Of The Time clone
(5 gallons/19 L, bottled under cork)
OG = 1.152 FG = 1.028
ABV = 16%

Ingredients
16 lbs. (7.3 kg) wildflower honey
2.5 gallons (9.5 L) 24 °Brix Black Muscat grapes
2 Tbsp. pectic enzyme
Water to 5 gallons (19 L)
20 g Lalvin KV1116 yeast
10 g Fermaid-K
2.5 g di-ammonium phosphate (DAP)
1.67 g potassium metabisulfite
4 g potassium sorbate

Step by step
Prepare the pectic enzyme by mixing with a small amount of 65 °F (18 °C) tap water. Crush the grapes, mix the pectic enzyme mixture with them and perform a two-hour cold soak prior to pressing off the juice. The grape pomace can be discarded.

Combine grape juice, honey, and water to 5 gallons (19 L). Re-hydrate and pitch the yeast. Degas and feed nutrients at 24, 48 and 72 hours. Ferment to target final gravity and stabilize with sorbate and metabisulfite. Rack off sediment. Bottle under cork.

Tips for Success:
The above directions results in an "orange" pyment due to the skins not being part of the ferment. This was a creative choice. Fermenting with the skins will produce a much darker color, but even more of the specific grape character as well.

Ordinary Bitter
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.038 FG = 1.011
IBU = 30 SRM = 11 ABV = 3.5%

Ingredients
7.0 lb. (3.2 kg) English pale ale malt
0.50 lb. (0.23 kg) crystal malt (120 °L)
0.25 lb. (113 g) Special Roast malt (50 °L)
5.75 AAU East Kent Goldings hops (60 min.) (1.2 oz./33 g of 5% alpha acids)
2.5 AAU East Kent Goldings hops (30 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g of 5% alpha acids)
0.5 oz. (14 g) East Kent Goldings hops (1 min.)
White Labs WLP002 (English Ale) or Wyeast 1968 (London ESB) or Lallemand London ESB Ale yeast
1/2 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Mill the grains and dough-in at around 1 qt. of water per pound of grain (about 2.1 L/kg) and a temperature of 152 °F (67 °C). Hold the mash at 152 °F (67 °C) for 60 minutes. Infuse the mash with near boiling water while stirring to raise the temperature to mash out at 168 °F (76 °C). Sparge slowly with 170 °F (77 °C) water, collecting wort until the pre-boil kettle volume is around 5.9 gallons (22 L) and the gravity is 1.032. Boil wort for 75 minutes. Add the bittering hops with 60 minutes remaining and the flavor hops with 30 minutes left in the boil. Add 1 tsp. Irish moss with 15 minutes left in the boil and add the last hop addition just before shutting off the burner. Chill the wort to 67 °F (19 °C), pitch yeast and aerate thoroughly. Ferment around 67 °F (19 °C) until the yeast drops clear. Allow the lees to settle and the brew to mature without pressure for another two days after fermentation appears finished. Rack to a keg or bottling bucket. Target a carbonation level of 1 to 1.5 volumes. (Use about 2.0 oz./57 g of corn sugar for bottle conditioning.) If you’re cask conditioning the beer, add priming sugar, any cask finings (gelatin or isinglass), and dry hop with 0.25 to 0.5 oz. (7–14 g) of whole East Kent Goldings hops. Allow the beer to condition in the cask for several days and serve via a beer engine or by gravity feed at 50–55 °F (10–13 °C).

Ordinary Bitter
(5 gallons/19 L, extract with grains)
OG = 1.038 FG = 1.011
IBU = 30 SRM = 11 ABV = 3.5%

Ingredients
4.7 lb. (1.95 kg) Maris Otter liquid malt extract
0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) crystal malt (120 °L)
0.25 lb. (113 g) Special Roast malt (50 °L)
5.75 AAU East Kent Goldings hops (60 min.) (1.2 oz./33 g of 5% alpha acids)
2.5 AAU East Kent Goldings hops (30 min.) (0.50 oz./14 g of 5% alpha acid)
0.5 oz. (14 g) East Kent Goldings hops (1 min.)
White Labs WLP002 (English Ale) or Wyeast 1968 (London ESB) or Lallemand London ESB Ale yeast
1/2 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Place the crushed grains in a grain bag and steep in about 2 gallons (~8 L) of water at ~170 °F (77 °C) for 30 minutes. Lift the grain bag out of the steeping liquid and rinse with warm water. Add enough water to the steeping liquid and malt extract to make a pre-boil volume of 5.68 gallons (21.5 L) and a gravity of 1.033 (8.40 °P). Stir thoroughly and bring to a boil. Once the wort is boiling, add the bittering hops. The total wort boil time is 1 hour after adding the bittering hops. During that time, add the flavor hops with 30 minutes remaining, Irish moss at 15 minutes, and the aroma hops just before shut-down. Chill the wort to 67 °F (19 °C), pitch yeast and aerate thoroughly. Follow the fermentation and packaging instructions for the all-grain version.

*Optional ingredient: 1/2 teaspoon Irish Moss

Step by step
Heat 2 gallons (7.6 L) of water to 160–165 ºF (~73 ºC), then turn the heat off. Add all the grains (or grain bag with grains in it) and stir well. The temperature should be 150 ºF (66 ºC). Adjust the temperature if necessary by adding heat, hot water or cold water. Allow the grains to soak for 40 to 60 minutes at 150 ºF (66 ºC). Heat 1 1/2 gallons (5.7 L) of water to 170 ºF (77 ºC) in a separate pot. Sparge the grains with this water when the mash is complete. Add water to the liquid collected from the grains to make up to 5 1/4 gallons (20 L) (adjust volume according to your own brewing system).

Heat the wort to almost boiling and then turn the heat off. Add the malt extract and organic sugar; dissolve completely. Turn the heat back on and bring to a boil. Once the wort has reached a rolling boil add 1/2 oz. (14 grams) German Hallertauer Tradition hop pellets (bittering) and boil for 40 minutes. Add 1 oz. (28 grams) German Spalt Select hops (flavor). If desired, add the Irish Moss flakes. Boil for 15 minutes more.

Add 1 oz. (28 grams) German Hallertauer Mittelfrüh hops (aroma), boil 5 more minutes and turn the heat off. Cool the wort to 65–75 ºF (18–24 ºC) and into primary fermenting vessel. Aerate well, pitch the yeast and ferment in a cool dark place for 4–6 days at 60–70 ºF (14–21 ºC) in the primary fermenter.

If you have a secondary fermenter, transfer the beer to it when fermentation activity has subsided (after 4–6 days). Ferment for an additional 7–14 days, or until fermentation is complete. Bottle the beer with the bottling sugar of your choice, or keg.

(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.059 FG = 1.002
IBU = 33 SRM = 12 ABV = 6.2%

Orval pours orange-brown with a big, rocky head. The very spritzy levels of carbonation and lightly sour with a distinctive Brett character make the beer feel prickly on the tongue. Orval beer is distinctly dry and has little hop bitterness or flavor, although it is the only Trappist ale to be dry hopped. You'll really taste the pale malt base, so don't use US, German or English malts for this.

1/2 tsp. Irish moss (15 min.)
White Labs WLP001 (California Ale) yeast
1 cup corn sugar (for priming)

Step by step
Place crushed grains in a steeping bag. In a large kitchen pot, heat 3 quarts (2.8 L) of water to 163 °F (73 °C). Submerge grain bag in this water and let steep at 152 °F (67 °C) for 30 minutes. While grains are steeping, begin heating 2 gallons (7.6 L) of water to a boil in your brewpot. When steeping is done, remove grain bag and rinse in brew kettle water (like making tea), pour in remaining tea and heat to a boil.

Once the wort has come to a boil, shut-off burner and add your liquid and dried malt extract. Stir gently, once dissolved turn burner back on and bring back to a boil. Add as much water in your kettle as you can but leave room for the initial foamy at the beginning of the boil. Once foaming has stopped, add the 60-minute hops and boil for 60 minutes, adding flavor hops at 30 minutes and Irish Moss when there is 15 minutes left in the boil.

When you have boiled for 60 minutes, shut-off the burner and add your finishing hops, put a lid on your brewpot and cool the wort in your sink in a cold-water and ice bath or use a wort chiller. Cool wort to 80 °F (27 °C) or less. Transfer the wort to your fermenter and leave as much trub behind as possible. Top up your fermenter to 5 1/4 gallons (20 L) with cool water, aerate wort and pitch the yeast. Ferment at 70 °F (21 °C). When fermentation slows to a halt, rack to secondary and add the dry hops. Leave in secondary fermenter one week then bottle or keg.

All-grain directions
Replace liquid and dried malt extract with 14 pounds (6.4 kg) Maris Otter two-row barley.

Heat 18 quarts (17 L) of brewing liquor to 167 °F and mash in grains at 151 °F (66 °C). Recirculate wort until it runs clear (approximately 20 minutes.) Begin filling your kettle slowly while sparging with 170 °F (77 °C) water. Collect 6 1/2 gallons (25 L) of wort. Bring wort to a boil and boil vigorously for 60 minutes. Follow extract with grain directions above.

IBU = 16 SRM = 12 ABV = 4.5%

Inspired by the clean amber lagers of Mexico and melded with malt flavors in Munich dunkels, this lager shows off what a maltster can do, and packs it in an easy-drinking 4.5% beer. Beerito is all about a complexity of subtle flavor with underlying tones of chocolate, caramel, walnuts, and toasted grain.

Ingredients
6.6 lbs. (3 kg) Vienna malt (3 °L)
12.5 oz. (355 kg) North American
2-row pale malt (1.8 °L)
5.1 oz. (144 g) aromatic or dark Munich malt (20 °L)
4.4 oz. (126 g) Simpsons Premium English Caramalt (25 °L)
16.8 oz. (477 g) Carabelge® malt (12 °L)
8.9 oz. (251 g) melanoidin malt (25 °L)
0.95 oz. (27 g) Carafa® Special IIImalt (500 °L)
2.5 AAU French Aramis hops (55 min.) (0.37 oz./10.2 g at 6.7% alpha acids)
3 AAU French Aramis hops (10 min.) (0.45 oz./12.6 g at 6.7% alpha acids)
2.7 AAU Hallertauer Mittelfrüh hops (0 min.) (0.61 oz./17 g at 4.5% alpha acids)
2 tsp. yeast nutrient (Servomyces recommended) (5 min.)
1⁄2 Whirlfloc tablet (5 min.)
Wyeast 2352 (Munich Lager II), White Labs WLP835 (German X Lager), or Mangrove Jack’s M76 (Bavarian Lager) yeast
3⁄4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Mill the grains and dough-in targeting a mash of around 1.3 quarts of water to 1 pound of grain (2.7 L/kg) and a temperature of 152 °F (67 °C). Hold the mash at 152 °F (67 °C) until enzymatic conversion is complete. Sparge slowly with 168 °F (75.5 °C) water, collecting 6.5 gallons (24.6 L) or wort.

Total boil time is 75 minutes. Add hops as indicated in the ingredient list and Whirlfloc and yeast nutrient with 5 minutes left in the boil. Give the wort a long stir after the boil is finished, add the last hop addition and let settle for 10 minutes.

Chill the wort to 50 °F (10 °C) and aerate thoroughly. Pitch rate is 1.5 million cells per mL per degree Plato. Begin fermentation at 53 °F (12 °C) and raise to 56 °F (13 °C) on day 4. At the end of fermentation, rack into a secondary and let rest 8 more days at 56 °F (13 °C). Lower temperature 5 °F (3 °C) every day until reaching 32 °F (0 °C). Lager at 32 °F (0 °C) for 1–2 weeks under pressure at 3–4 psi, or longer, to clarify. Once clear, rack and carbonate to around 2.55 volumes of CO2.

White Labs WLP001 (California Ale), Wyeast 1056 (American Ale), or Safale US-05 yeast
3⁄4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

STEP BY STEP
Mill the grains and dough-in targeting a mash of around 1.3 quarts of water to 1 pound of grain (2.7 L/kg) and a temperature of 155 °F (68 °C). Hold the mash at 155 °F (68 °C) until enzymatic conversion is complete. Sparge slowly with 168 °F (76 °C) water, collecting wort until the pre-boil kettle volume is 6.5 gallons (24.6 L).

Total boil time is 90 minutes, adding hops according to the schedule. Add Whirlfloc and yeast nutrient with 5 minutes remaining in the boil.

After the boil is complete, give the wort a long stir to create a whirlpool, add the flameout hops and let settle for 10 minutes. Chill the wort to 65 °F (18 °C) and aerate thoroughly. Pitch rate is 1 million cells per mL per degree Plato.

Regulate the fermentation temperature at 68 °F (20 °C). At the end of fermentation activity, ~5 days, rack the beer into a secondary vessel and let rest for 7 more days at 68 °F (20 °C). Then lower temperature to 32 °F (0 °C). Once beer is clarified, rack the beer and carbonate to around 2.55 volumes of CO2. If bottling conditioning, you may consider pitching fresh yeast at bottling.

Oskar Blues wows malt lovers with this mega-malty Scottish strong ale brewed with a variety of specialty malts (including a touch of smoked malt). It features flavors of cocoa and coffee with just a bit of smoke.

INGREDIENTS
13 lb. 10 oz. (6.2 kg) North American 2-row pale malt
18 oz. (0.52 kg) English dark crystal malt
12 oz. (0.34 kg) Munich malt (10°L)
3.5 oz. (99 g) English chocolate malt
6 oz. (0.17 kg) Special B malt
4.5 oz. (0.13 kg) Weyermann smoked malt
9.6 AAU Nugget hops (60 mins.) (0.8 oz./23 g of 12% alpha acids)
Wyeast 1056 (American Ale), White Labs WLP001 (California Ale), or Fermentis Safale US-05 yeast
(3.5 qt./3.5 L yeast starter)
3/4 cup corn sugar (dextrose)

STEP BY STEP
If possible, make a smaller beer 2 to 4 weeks prior to brewing this beer and use the yeast from the small beer to pitch into this beer. Otherwise, make a 3.5 quart (3.5 L) yeast starter several days prior to brew day. Mash the grains at 155°F (68°C). Boil for 90 minutes, adding the hops with 60 minutes left in the boil. Pitch the yeast and ferment at 69°F (21°C) until final gravity is reached. Bottle or keg, then cold condition the beer for at least 3 weeks at or below 50°F (10°C) before serving.

PARTIAL MASH OPTION:
Scale down the North American 2-row pale malt to 8 ounces (0.23 kg) and add 3 pounds (1.4 kg) Muntons light dried malt extract and 5.5 pounds (2.5 kg) Muntons light liquid malt extract to the ingredients list. Steep the grains at 155°F (68°C) in 5 quarts (4.7 L) of water. Rinse the grains and add water to the "grain tea" to make at least 3.5 gallons (13 L). Add the dried malt extract and bring to a boil. Boil for 60 minutes, adding the hops at the beginning of the boil. Stir in the liquid malt extract near the end of the boil. Cool the wort and transfer to your fermenter. Top up to 5 gallons (19 L) with filtered water. Follow the remaining portion of the all-grain recipe.

Oskar Blues Brewery’s Ten FIDY clone
(3 gallons/11 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.106 FG = 1.034
IBU = 98 SRM = 74 ABV = 10.5%

Ingredients
10.6 lbs. (4.8 kg) 2-row pale malt (2 °L)
2.85 lbs. (1.3 kg) Munich malt (9 °L)
1.43 lbs. (0.65 kg) Simpsons caramalt (25 °L)
1.43 lbs. (0.65 kg) Simpsons dark crystal malt (95 °L)
1.43 lbs. (0.65 kg) chocolate malt (350 °L)
1.22 lbs. (0.55 kg) roasted barley (550 °L)
1.43 lbs. (0.65 kg) flaked oats
4 oz. (113 kg) re-hydrated rice hulls (added during lautering)
18 AAU Summit™ hops (60 min.) (1 oz./28 g at 18% alpha acid)
3.4 AAU Columbus hops (10 min.) (0.25 oz./7 g at 14% alpha acid)
1⁄2 Whirlfloc® tablet (10 min.)
Wyeast 1056 (American Ale) or White Labs WLP001 (California Ale) or Fermentis US-05 yeast
Lallemand CBC-1 yeast (if priming)
2⁄5 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Target the mash ratio to be about 1.3 quarts of water to 1 pound of grain (2.7 kg/L), or 37% malt by weight. Be sure to add in the volume of dead space liquid that is left in the mash tun after it is drained. For this recipe, that means approximately 28 qts (26.5 L) of strike water estimating 2 qts. (2 L) dead space in the mash tun. Mash the grains at 152 °F (67 °C) and hold at this temperature for 60 minutes. Raise the temperature of the grain bed to mash out at 168 °F (76 °C), add the rice hulls, then begin lauter phase by recirculating the wort back on top of the grain bed (vorlauf). Vorlauf until the wort runs clear, then drain all the wort in the mash tun into your kettle. There should be about 4 gal. (15 L) in your kettle with a gravity reading around 1.086. Add an appropriate amount of dried malt extract if this gravity is too low.

Total boil time is 60 minutes, adding hops at the times indicated in the ingredients list, and Whirfloc® tablet with 10 minutes left in the boil. At 0 minutes, turn off the heat and give the wort a stir for at least a minute and let it settle for 10 minutes. The total volume in the kettle should be about 3.25 gallons (12.3 L). You can add some cold tap water to correct the volume if necessary. Chill to yeast pitching temperature, pitch the yeast, then heavily aerate the wort. After 12 hours, hit the wort with a second dose of oxygen if possible. Ferment at 67 °F (19 °C) for 2–3 weeks or until target gravity has been achieved. Transfer to a secondary vessel and drop the temperature to 54 °F (21 °C) and condition the beer for a minimum of 3 weeks. At this point you have the option of leaving the base beer as is or adding an array of ingredients such as vanilla or whiskey soaked oak chips to suit your tastes. Rack to a keg and force carbonate, or rack to a bottling bucket, add priming sugar, and bottle. If the beer was aged in secondary for more than a few months, adding priming yeast such as Lallemand’s CBC-1 is suggested if bottle conditioning.

1⁄2 Whirlfloc® tablet (10 min.)
Wyeast 1056 (American Ale) or White Labs WLP001 (California Ale) or Fermentis US-05 yeast
Lallemand CBC-1 yeast (if priming)
2⁄3 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Place the crushed Munich malt in a muslin bag with the flaked oats. Submerge the grain bag in 1 gallon (~4 L) of hot water to hold the mash at 152 °F (67 °C) for 60 minutes. Raise the temperature of the mash to 168 °F (76 °C), then remove the grain bag and wash with 2 qts. of 168 °F (76 °C) water. Add an additional 2 gallons of 168 °F (76 °C) water to the wort, then add the remainder of the crushed specialty grains in a second muslin bag. Hold for 20 minutes at this temperature. Remove the specialty grain bag and rinse with 1 gallon (~4 L) of hot water. Top off kettle to about 6 gallons (23 L) water and bring to a boil. Once at a boil, remove the kettle from heat and add the liquid and dried malt extract. Stir until all the malt extract is dissolved, then return the wort to a boil. The wort gravity at this point should be 1.089 at room temperature.

Total boil time is 60 minutes, adding hops at the times indicated and Whirfloc® tablet with 10 minutes left in the boil. At 0 minutes, turn off the heat then give the wort a stir for at least a minute and let settle for 10 minutes. Chill to yeast pitching temperature, pitch the yeast then heavily aerate the wort. After 24 hours, hit the wort with a second dose of oxygen. Ferment at 67 °F (19 °C) for 2–3 weeks or until target gravity has been achieved. Transfer to a secondary vessel and drop temperature to 54 °F (21 °C) and condition the beer for a minimum of 3 weeks. Now follow the remainder of the all-grain recipe above.

Otter Creek Mud Bock Spring Ale clone
(5 gallons/19 L, extract with grains)
OG = 1.058 FG = 1.019
IBU = 28 SRM= 19.2 ABV = 5.5%

Ingredients
3.3 lbs. (1.5 kg) Muntons Light malt extract syrup
1.5 lbs. (.7 kg) Muntons Light dried malt extract
2.25 Lbs. (1 kg) Munich Malt (10 ºL)
12 oz. (340 g) crystal malt (40 ºL)
10 oz. (280 g) crystal malt (20 ºL)
10 oz. (280 g) dextrin malt
6 oz. (170 g) chocolate malt
6 oz. (113 g) wheat malt
9.0 AAU Cascade hops (bittering hop, 60 min.) (2.0 oz./57 g of 4.5% alpha acid)
White Labs WLP029 (German Ale) or Wyeast 1007 (German Ale) yeast
0.75 cup of corn sugar (for priming)

Step by step:

Steep the six crushed malts in 3 gallons (13.5 L) of water at 150º (66 ºC) for 30 minutes. Remove grains from wort, add the malt syrup and dry malt extract and bring to a boil. Add the Cascade hops and boil for 60 minutes. There are no finishing hops in this recipe.

Now add wort to 2 gallons (9 L) of cool water in a sanitary fermenter, and top off with cool water to 5.5 gallons (25 L). Cool the wort to 75 ºF (24 ºC), aerate the beer and pitch your yeast. Allow the beer to cool over the next few hours to 68 ºF (20 ºC), and hold at this temperature until the beer has finished fermenting. Otter Creek suggests that you cold age the beer at near freezing temperature for about five days, then bottle and enjoy!

All-grain option:

This is a single step infusion mash. Substitute 6 lbs. (2.7 kg) 2-row malt for the malt extracts. Mash the 7 crushed grains together at 150 ºF (66 ºC) for 60 minutes. Collect approximately 7 gallons wort (32 L) to boil for 90 minutes and have a 5.5-gallon yield (25 L). Lower the amount of the Cascade hops in the boil to 1.5 ounces (42 grams) to account for higher extraction ratio of a full boil.

Add wort to 2 gallons (9 L) of cool water in a sanitary fermenter, and top off with cool water to 5.5 gallons (25 L). Cool the wort to 75 ºF (24 ºC), aerate the beer and pitch your yeast. Allow the beer to cool over the next few hours to 68 ºF (20 ºC), and hold at this temperature until the beer has finished fermenting. This brew should also be cold aged at near freezing temperature for about five days before bottling. Enjoy!

0.5 oz. (14 g) Apollo hops (dry hop)
Wyeast 1272 (American Ale II) or White Labs WLP051 (California V) or Lallemand Nottingham yeast
Priming sugar (if bottling)

Step by Step
This is a single infusion mash. Heat 4.5 gallons (17 L) strike water to 165 °F (74 °C) to stabilize the mash temperature at 154 °F (68 °C). Rest at this temperature for 45 minutes then begin lautering. Once you begin your run-off into your kettle, add the first wort hops. Collect 6 gallons (23 L) of wort and boil 60 minutes. After knockout, begin a whirlpool and let the wort spin for 20 minutes.

Chill wort to 63 °F (17 °C), pitch an appropriate yeast starter (~1 qt./1 L) and aerate the wort thoroughly. Ferment at 65 °F (18 °C). After primary fermentation subsides, add dry hops for 10 days before packaging. Carbonate the beer to 2.4 volumes CO2.

(5 gallons/19 L, extract with grains)
OG = 1.052 FG = 1.013
IBU = 39 SRM = 7 ABV = 5.0%

Ingredients
3.3 lbs. (1.5 kg) Coopers light malt extract
3 lbs. (1.4 kg) amber dry malt extract
8 oz. (224 g) crystal malt (40 ºL)
2 oz. (56 g) extra dark crystal malt (135–165 ºL)
1/2. oz. (14 g) Chinook hops (60 min.)

1 oz. (28 g) Willamette hops (5 min.)
1 tsp. Irish moss (45 min.)
White Labs WLP001 (California Ale) yeast
3/4 cup priming sugar

Step by Step
Fill brew pot with at least 3 gallons (11.4 L) of cold fresh water. Bring water temperature up to 150 ºF (66 ºC). Add steeping grains to a muslin bag. Tie up the end of the bag and add to the brewing pot. Steep grains for 15–20 minutes then remove. Stir in the liquid and dry malt extracts until completely dissolved. Bring the wort to a boil making sure to watch carefully to prevent a boil over. Once a nice gentle rolling boil is achieved, add the first addition of Chinook hops. The total boiling time will be 60 minutes. At 30 minutes into the boil, add the first addition of Willamette Hops. At 45 minutes into the boil, add the Irish Moss.

At 55 minutes into the boil, add the second addition of Willamette Hops. After 60 minutes, turn off stove and remove brewing pot from heat. Remove hops. Cool the wort down as quickly as possible by using a wort chiller or by placing brewing pot into a cold water bath in your sink. Once wort has reached 75–80 ºF (~25 ºC), add it to your fermenter. Top the fermenter up to 5 gallons (19 L) with fresh cold water. Mix well to aerate the wort and add the yeast. Allow the beer to ferment at 65–70 ºF (~19 ºC) until complete (typically 7–10 days) and then either rack to a secondary, keg or bottle the beer. Wait 10–14 days and enjoy your beer!

Outer Banks Brewing Station’s Lemongrass Wheat Ale clone
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.050 FG = 1.012
IBU = 17 SRM = 4 ABV = 4.9 %

Ingredients
5.5 lbs. (2.5 kg) wheat malt
4 lbs. (1.8 kg) Pilsner malt
0.25 lb. (113 g) CaraHell® malt (10 °L)
0.25 lb. (113 g) Vienna malt
0.1 lb. (45 g) acidulated malt
4.5 AAU Liberty hops (60 min.) (1 oz./28 g at 4.5% alpha acids)
5 oz. (142 g) fresh, smashed lemongrass (0 min.)
Wyeast 3068 (Weihenstephan Weizen), White Labs WLP300 (Hefeweizen Ale), or SafAle WB-06 yeast
1 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Mill the grains, then mix with 3.2 gallons (12 L) of 169 °F (76 °C) strike water to achieve a single infusion rest temperature of 153 °F (67 °C). Hold this temperature for 60 minutes. Mashout to 170 °F (77 °C) if desired.

Vorlauf until your runnings are clear before directing them to your boil kettle. Batch or fly sparge the mash and run-off to obtain 6.5 gallons (24.6 L) of wort. Boil for 60 minutes, adding the Liberty hops at the beginning of the boil. No need to add any fining agents as this is meant to be a cloudy beer.
After the boil, add the fresh lemongrass and rapidly chill the wort to at least 68 °F (20 °C). Pitch yeast, then maintain this temperature for the duration of active fermentation.

Once primary fermentation is complete and the beer has settled, bottle or keg the beer and carbonate to approximately 3.0 volumes.

Outer Banks Brewing Station’s Lemongrass Wheat Ale clone
(5 gallons/19 L, extract only)
OG = 1.050 FG = 1.012
IBU = 17 SRM = 5 ABV = 4.9%

Ingredients
4 lbs. (1.8 kg) wheat dried malt extract
1.5 lbs. (0.68 kg) Pilsen dried malt extract
1/2 tsp. 88% lactic acid
4.5 AAU Liberty hops (60 min.) (1 oz./28 g at 4.5% alpha acids)
5 oz. (142 g) fresh, smashed lemongrass
Wyeast 3068 (Weihenstephan Weizen), White Labs WLP300 (Hefeweizen Ale), or SafAle WB-06 yeast
1 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Warm 6.5 gallons (25 L) of water to roughly 150 °F (66 °C). Add the two types of extract and lactic acid, with stirring, before heating to a boil. Return to heat once all the extract is dissolved. Boil for 60 minutes, adding hops at the beginning of the boil. No need to add any fining agents.

After the boil, add the fresh lemongrass and rapidly chill the wort to at least 68 °F (20 °C). Pitch yeast. Maintain this temperature for fermentation. Once primary fermentation is complete and the beer has settled, bottle or keg the beer and carbonate to approximately 3.0 volumes or as high as your draft/bottle pouring system will allow.

Tips for Success:
This recipe is best brewed as an all-grain version as the nuances provided by the CaraHell® and Vienna malt aid in producing a mildly complex malt profile. Water chemistry should be fairly neutral with neither chlorides nor sulfates being emphasized. Finally, use the freshest lemongrass that you can find; pinch it and smell your fingers, it should have a citrus, ginger aroma. Similarly, don’t forget to crush the lemongrass before adding it to the end of the boil as masticated lemongrass releases substantially more oil into the brew.

1.25 oz. (35 g) Centennial hops (secondary dry hop)
1.25 oz. (35 g) Simcoe® hops (secondary dry hop)
White Labs WLP001 (California Ale) or Wyeast 1056 (American Ale) yeast (1.5 qt./~1.5 L yeast starter) or Lallemand BRY 097 or Fermentis Safale US-05 yeast (1 sachet)
3/4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Mash at 155 °F (68 °C) for 40 minutes. Sparge enough to collect roughly 7.5 gallons (28 L) in your kettle to achieve 6.5 gallons (25 L) at knockout. Boil for a grand total of 75 minutes. Just after knockout toss in the first set of knockout hops and begin the whirlpool process. You can either run your pump for 10 minutes or you can stir for a minute and then let spin down and settle. After 30 minutes have gone past after knockout, reduce wort temperature to 170 °F (77 °C) and then add the second set of hops to the hop stand and once again whirlpool. After 15 more minutes have passed, begin final cooling process. The goal is to get at least 5.5 gallons (21 L) into your fermenter to compensate for the loss of wort which will occur during dry hopping. Make sure your primary fermenter has enough headspace to accommodate that much wort plus a large kräusen. Pitch a healthy dose of yeast when wort hits 65 °F (18 °C). After final gravity has been achieved, add a clarifying agent such as polyclar. Allow three days for clarifying agent to work, then add first set of dry hops to primary fermenter. After 7 days, rack beer off dry hops & yeast cake either into a keg or secondary fermenter. Try to purge with carbon dioxide if available to you. Add second round of dry hops and wait 5 days. Bottle or begin carbonation process.

Paavo Pruul’s koduõlu (western Estonian farmhouse ale)
Paavo Pruul’s koduõlu (western Estonian farmhouse ale)
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.066 FG = 1.016
IBU = ~14 SRM = 8 ABV = 6.6%

I’ve had to extrapolate some of the numbers and ingredients from other brewers on Hiiumaa and Saaremaa, since Paavo never weighed his hops or measured the alpha acids in them. The malts really should be homemade, and most brewers use Estonian bread yeast, but obviously that’s not going to work here. The juniper must be Juniperus communis, branches, not too thick, with some green or blue berries on them.

Ingredients
14 lbs. (6.4 kg) Vienna malt
1–2 blackcurrant leaves (not necessary)
3–4 juniper branches
5–6 stalks of sweet gale (60 min.)
19.6 AAU Saaz hops (60 min.) (7 oz./200 g at 2.8% alpha acids)
Fermentis S-04 or a hefeweizen yeast

Step by Step
First, remember that you are making a farmhouse ale. You don’t have to hit any of the numbers exactly. A day or two before brew day, make a 1-quart (1-L) yeast starter with (optional) crushed blackcurrant leaves mixed in.

On brew day, mill the grains, then put 2–3 juniper branches in the bottom of the mash tun and the malts above them. Add hot water, about 3–3.5 gallons (11.4–13.3 L) to hit a mash temperature of 160 °F (71 °C), and stir well. This should be a very thick mash at this point (where a heavy wooden mash paddle will slowly tilt to the side). Make sure the mash tun is well insulated so the temperature stays high. Leave for two hours. After the first hour, bring about 1 gallon (4 L) of water to a boil with hops and sweet gale in it and boil for one hour. Add the boiling hop- and sweet gale-infused water addition, bringing the mash back up to 160 °F (71 °C), stir again, and start boiling the sparge water with a juniper branch in it. At the end, when you’ve mashed four hours, the mash temperature should be roughly 153 °F (67 °C). Finally, sparge with enough of the juniper-infused water to collect about 5.25 gallons (20 L) in the fermenter.

Pour the wort into the fermenter so it splashes against the bottom, getting lots of oxygen into the wort. Cool the wort to 68 °F (20 °C), then pitch the yeast. Let it ferment 72 hours, then transfer to keg with spunding-valve. Leave the keg in a warm place so the beer carbonates. Note that the carbonation should be well below that of modern beer.

Tips For Success:
I realize a lot of the numbers sound absurd, but that’s really the temperatures and times these people use. I’ve brewed Terje’s recipe 3–4 times, and 165 °F (74 °C) and short fermentation really does give the best results.

During the mash, be sure to stir well so that all lumps are broken up, allowing the hot water to pasteurize the malts completely. Don’t shorten the mash, because you need the time to make sure everything is pasteurized.

Remember there is no cold-side, so you really have to sanitize the mashtun, filter, juniper branches, and everything that’s used during mash and lautering. Yes, pasteurization should, in theory, take care of it, but in practice raw ale brewers are very careful with sanitation. Terje dips the juniper branches in boiling juniper infusion, for example.

3.75 lbs. (1.7 kg) Pilsner liquid malt extract (late addition)
1 lb. 4 oz. (0.57 kg) Pilsner malt
8.0 oz. (0.23 kg) acidulated malt
4.0 oz. (113 g) Carapils® malt
6 AAU Nothern Brewer hops (60 min.) (0.66 oz./19 g of 9% alpha acids)
1.3 AAU Saaz hops (20 min.) (0.37 oz./11 g of 3.5% alpha acids)
1.3 AAU Saaz hops (10 min.) (0.37 oz./11 g of 3.5% alpha acids)
0.25 oz. (7.1 g) Saaz hops (2 mins)
1 tsp. Irish moss
Wyeast 2124 (Bohemian Lager) or White Labs WLP830 (German Lager) yeast (3 qt./~3 L yeast starter)
7/8 cup corn sugar (for priming)

Step by Step
Place crushed grains in a nylon steeping bag. In a large kitchen pot, heat 3.0 qts. (2.8 L) of water to 164 °F (73 °C). Submerge grain bag in water and let steep at 153 °F (67 °C) for 45 minutes. (If temperature drops below 149 °F (65 °C), heat to 153 °F (67 °C) again.) While grains are steeping, heat 2.0 qts. (~2.0 L) of water to 168 °F (76 °C) in a sauce pan. Also, begin heating 2 gallons (7.6 L) of water to a boil in your brewpot. When steeping is done, place a colander over your brewpot and lift the grain bag into it. Pour the "grain tea" through the bag (which will strain out most of the grain bits), then rinse the bag with the 2.0 qts. (~2.0 L) of 168 °F (76 °C) water.

Heat the (roughly) 3 gallons (11 L) of wort in your brewpot to a boil, then stir in dried malt extract. (It will foam a bit, so don’t pour all the extract in at once.) Bring the wort back to a boil, add the first charge hops and boil for 60 minutes. Add first charge of Saaz hops with 20 minutes left in the boil. Add liquid malt extract and Irish moss with 15 minutes left in boil. Add second charge of Saaz with 10 minutes left in boil and add final charge with 2 minutes from the end of the boil.

After the boil, put a lid on your brewpot and cool the wort (either in a cold-water bath in your sink or with a wort chiller). Cool until the side of the brewpot feels distinctly cool to the touch. Transfer wort to your fermenter and top up to 5 gallons (19 L) with cool water. (It’s best if at least 1 gallon (3.8 L) of the topping up water has been refrigerated.) Aerate the wort and pitch your yeast. Ferment at 55 °F (13 °F). When fermentation slows, let temperature rise to 60 °F (15 °C). Hold at this temperature for two days, the dial the temperature down to 40 °F (4.4 °C) at the rate of about 4 °F (~2 °C) per day. Lager at this temperature for 3 weeks. Bottle with corn sugar (or keg).

Two or three days before brew day, make a 2-qt. (2-L) yeast starter, aerating the wort thoroughly (preferably with oxygen) before pitching the yeast.

Use 6 gallons (23 L) of water in the brew kettle; heat to 158 °F (70 °C). Place the malts and grains in a mesh bag, and steep in the hot water for 30 minutes. Remove the mesh bag, then turn the heat off. Add the liquid malt extract and stir thoroughly to dissolve the extract completely. You do not want to feel liquid extract at the bottom of the kettle when stirring with your spoon. Turn the heat back on and bring to a boil. Boil the wort for 60 minutes, adding the hops at the times indicated in the recipe.

Chill to 65 °F (18 °C). Oxygenate, then pitch the yeast starter. Ferment at 65 °F (18 °C) for 5 days, then let rise to 68 °F (20 °C) and ferment for 7 days. Rack the beer into keg or secondary. Prime and bottle condition, or keg and force carbonate.

Tips for Success:
This was Christopher’s first attempt at brewing this recipe, which is a variation of a proven English brown ale recipe with the addition of kiln coffee malt. Creating variations of proven winners is one of Christopher’s proven methods for winning medals. Porters are not technically challenging beers, however be sure to find a good malt balance. He also advises to take the time and spend the money to source proper English malts, hops, and yeast.

Terry Foster, author of Porter (Classic Beer Style) (Brewers Publications, 1998), advises that one reason why porter was historically well-suited to brewing in London was because the city’s water is high in temporary hardness (calcium carbonate). So long as your mash acidity is in the range of pH 5.2–5.5, however, you should be fine.

"We use pale and roasted malt to give our ale a rich, full maltiness and a deep, dark amber color. The nature of a WEE HEAVY makes for a higher alcohol percentage but this softens and counterbalances the sweet maltiness of the ales."

Ingredients
9.9 lbs. (4.46 kg) Munton's Maris Otter liquid malt extract
1 lb. (0.45 kg) extra light dried malt extract
4 oz. (112 g) roasted black barley
7 AAU Cascade hops (60 min.) (1.4 oz./39 g of 5% alpha acid)
1 tsp. Irish moss (15 mins)
White Labs WLP001 (California Ale) or Wyeast 1056 (American Ale) yeast (1.5 qts./~1.5 L yeast starter)
O.75 cup corn sugar (for priming)

Step by Step
Steep the crushed malts in 3 gallons (11 L) of water at 150 ºF (66 °C) for 20 minutes. Add 6.6 lbs. (3 kg) of malt extract and bring to a boil. Add Cascade (bittering) hops and boil for 45 minutes. Turn off heat and stir in remaining malt extract and Irish moss and boil for an additional 15 minutes.
When done boiling, cool wort . Transfer wort to fermenter and top up to 5.25 gallons (20 L) with cool water. Aerate wort and pitch yeast. As with any high-gravity beer, your results will greatly improve if you make a yeast starter. Cooler fermentation temperatures, from 60–65 °F (16–18 °C), will yield a cleaner, more traditional finish. Bottle your beer, age for two to three weeks and enjoy!

All-grain option: Replace the malt extract with 16 lbs. (7.3 kg) British two-row pale ale malt . Mash all your grains at 157 ºF (69 °C) for 60 minutes. Use 20 qts. (19 L) of mash water. Collect 8 gallons (30 L) and boil down to until 5.5 gallons (23 L) in the kettle. The will compress down to about 5.25 gallons (20 L) once cool.

Boil for 60 minutes, adding hops at times indicated in the ingredient list. (Do not let boil volume drop below 3.0 gallons/11 L; add boiling water to top up if this occurs.) Add liquid malt extract with 15 minutes left in boil. Cool wort, then transfer to fermenter. Top up with cool water to 5.0 gallons (19 L), aerate and pitch yeast. Ferment at 68 °F (20 °C). One beer falls clear, rack directly to keg or bottling bucket. (In other words, skip your secondary fermenter.)

Molasses and licorice option:
Add one 12-oz. (355-mL) bottle of Granny’s unsulphured molasses and 2.0 in. (5.1 cm) of brewers licorice for last 15 minutes of boil.

Parti Like It’s 1700
(15 gallon/57 L, all-grain)
Average OG = 1.064

Wee Heavy (First Runnings)
(5 gallons/19 L)
OG = 1.096 FG = 1.023
IBU = 22 SRM = 24 ABV = 9.2%

Scottish Export (Second Runnings)
(10 gallons/38 L)
OG = 1.052 FG = 1.013
IBU = 24 SRM = 13 ABV = 5.1%

This parti-gyle recipe uses a 1⁄3 and 2⁄3 split of the mash, with the smaller volume Wee Heavy collected first and the larger volume Scottish Export being collected second.

Ingredients
38 lbs. (17.2 kg) English pale ale malt
5 lbs. (2.27 kg) caramalt (10 °L)
0.5 lb. (227 g) roasted barley (550 °L)
2 lbs. (0.91 kg) carastan malt (34 °L) (cap grains)
7 AAU Kent Goldings hops (60 min. – Wee Heavy) (1.4 oz./40 gat 5% alpha acids)
12 AAU Fuggle hops (60 min. – Scottish Export) (2.5 oz./71 g at 4.8% alpha acid)
4 packs White Labs WLP028 (Edinburgh Scottish Ale) yeast
2 cups corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Mill the grains, holding the carastan malt separately. Dough-in the pale ale malt, caramalt, and roasted barley, targeting a mash of around 1.2 quarts of water to 1 pound of grain (2.5 L/kg) and a temperature of 152 °F (67 °C) using 13 gallons (49.4 L) of water at 166 °F (74 °C). Hold the mash at 152 °F (67 °C) until enzymatic conversion is complete, about 60 minutes. In your hot liquor tank, bring 15.1 gallons (57 L) of sparge water up to 170 °F (77 °C). Sparge slowly with 170 °F (77 °C) water, collecting wort until the pre-boil kettle volume is 6 gallons (22.7 L), you should use about 5.1 gallons (19 L) of sparge water. If taking a gravity reading, your pre-boil gravity should be 1.080 to achieve 1.096 at 5 gallons post-boil. Add 1.4 oz. (40 g) Kent Goldings hops once a boil is reached. Total boil time is only 60 minutes.

During this first runnings boil, add the 2 lbs. (0.91 kg) carastan (34 °L) malt to cap grains in the mash tun. Stir in to wet and solubilize the protein and sugar in the grain. Let rest for 15 minutes. Take your additional 10 gallons (38 L) of 170 °F (77 °C) sparge water and add slowly, draining wort to a second kettle until 12 gallons (45 L) is collected. If taking a gravity reading, your pre-boil gravity should be 1.044 to achieve 1.052 at 10 gallons (38 L) collected post-boil. Add 2.5 oz. (71 g) Fuggle hops once a boil is reached. Total boil time is 60 minutes.

Chill both worts to 68 °F (20 °C) and aerate thoroughly. Pitch 2 packages of yeast into each batch. Ferment in primary at 68–70 °F (20–21 °C) for two weeks. The Scottish export may be ready to bottle or keg after two weeks. Continue fermenting the wee heavy for an additional 2 weeks to 2 months in a secondary fermenter. Bottle or keg as usual.

Heat 6.5 gallons (24.6 L) of water in your brew kettle. Place crushed grains in a muslin bag and steep in the water as it heats up until the temperature reaches 165 °F (74 °C). Remove the grains, allowing the liquid to drip back into the kettle. Turn off the heat and stir in the liquid malt extract until it is dissolved and you can’t feel liquid extract at the bottom of the kettle when stirring. Then bring the wort up to a boil. Boil for 60 minutes adding hops, Whirlfloc, and yeast nutrients as indicated in the ingredients section. Follow the remainder of the all-grain recipe.

Tips for success:
If brewing a 5-gallon (19-L) batch, Matt Misfeldt recommends picking your favorite of the two recommended liquid yeast strains or a favorite dried strain. If brewing a batch of 10+ gallons (38+ L) and have access to White Labs liquid yeast, he recommends combining the two strains.

IBU = 18 SRM = 5 ABV = 5.6%

Paulaner Hefe-Weizen is a well-balanced example of a hefe-weizen. Follow the mash details and watch your fermentation temperatures to get the much sought after "breadiness" and banana/clove aroma of a German hefe-weizen. Prost!

Ingredients
1.5 lbs. (0.68 kg) Briess dried wheat malt extract
3.75 lbs. (1.7 kg) Weyermann Bavarian Hefeweizen light liquid wheat malt extract (late addition)
2.1 lbs. (0.95 kg) wheat malt
0.91 lbs. (0.41 kg) Pilsner malt
4.75 AAU Hallertau-Hersbrücker hops(1.2 oz./34 g of 4% alpha acids)
Wyeast 3638 (Bavarian Wheat) or White Labs WLP380 (Hefeweizen IV) yeast(1.5 qt./1.5 L yeast starter)
1.2 cups corn sugar (for priming)

Step by Step
In a large soup pot, heat 4.5 quarts (4.3 L) of water to 169 °F (76 °C). Add crushed grains to grain bag. Submerge bag and let grains steep around 158 °F (70 °C) for 45 minutes. While grains steep, begin heating 2.1 gallons (7.8 L) of water in your brewpot. When steep is over, remove 1.5 qts. (1.4 L) of water from brewpot and add to the "grain tea" in steeping pot. Place colander over brewpot and place steeping bag in it. Pour diluted grain tea through grain bag. Heat liquid in brewpot to a boil, then stir in dried malt extract, add first charge of hops and begin the 60 minutes boil. With 15 minutes left in boil, turn off heat and stir in liquid malt extract. Stir well to dissolve extract, then resume heating. (Keep the boil clock running while you stir.) At the end of the boil, cool wort and transfer to fermenter. Add water to make 5 gallons (19 L). Aerate wort and pitch yeast. Ferment at 68 °F (20 °C). Rack to secondary when fermentation is complete. Bottle a few days later, when beer falls clear.

All-grain option:
Replace grains and extract with 7.5 lbs. (3.4 kg) wheat malt and 3.25 lbs. (1.5 kg) Pilsner malt. Use a single decoction mash with a 30 minute rest at 131 °F (55 °C) and a 45 minute rest at 153 °F (67 °C). Boil for 120 minutes.

Step by Step 
Water profile: half RO water, half filtered San Diego tap water, with 2 grams of calcium carbonate added. Dough in with 7.0 gallons (26 L) of 170 °F (77 °C) water to hit a mash temp of 154 °F (68 °C). Mash for 60 min, then mash out at 168 °F (76 °C). Collect 8.0 gallons (30 L) sweet wort. Boil 90 minutes. Chill rapidly. Oxygenate. Ferment at 50 °F (10 °C) for 3–4 weeks, raising to 55 °F (13 °C) during last 3 days. Lager for a year.

To turn into an eisbock, reduce slightly (remove a quart or two of ice), then lager another year. This is a strong doppelbock, but is not overly intense on the malts; reduction increases the intensity. Eis by freezing until slushy, then transferring it to another keg via a surescreen to filter out the larger chunks. Concentrate to taste, but watch over-concentrating. Additional lagering greatly helps the flavors smooth out. [Original extract efficiency = 55%. Two base malts adjusted proportionally. 10 AAU bittering hops (60-min addition).]

Step by Step 
Place crushed grains in a large steeping bag and place in a 2.0-gallon (7.6-L) beverage cooler. Mix 5.5 qts. (5.2 L) of hot (~168 °F/76 °C) water into the grains and let rest, insulated, for 45 minutes. (The temperature should end up around 154 °F/68 °C.) Draw off a couple cups of wort and pour them back into cooler. Repeat 3 or 4 times to complete recirculation. Draw off between 0.5-1.0 qt. (~0.5–1.0 L) of wort and pour in brewpot. Add the same amount of hot (~185 °F/85 °C) water to top of cooler. You’ll need about 6 qts. (~6 L) of hot water (sparge water) total. If grain bed temperature approaches 170 °F (77 °C), cool sparge water to 170 °F (77 °C). Keep collecting wort (and adding sparge water) until you have collected 11 qts. (10 L) of wort. Add water to make 4 gallons (15 L) of wort, stir in dried malt extract and bring to a boil. Boil for 60 minutes, adding hops at times indicated. Stir in liquid malt extract during final 15 minutes of boil. Cool wort, transfer to fermenter and top up to 5 gallons (19 L) with cold water. Ferment at 50 °F (10 °C) for 3–4 weeks, raising the temperature to 55 °F (13 °C) during last 3 days. Lager for a year. See all-grain recipe for eisbock option.

Paul Zocco's Flemish Red Ale
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.061 FG = 1.015
IBU = 21 SRM = 27 ABV = 5.9%

Paul Zocco, owner of Zok's Homebrewing Supplies, in Willimantic, Connecticut says, "I spent a day at Rodenbach inhaling a few Grand Crus, one of the world's best Flemish Red there is. This beer recipe has won many golds in New England competitions and it made the second round in the 2005 National Homebrew Contest."

Ingredients
7.0 lbs. (3.2 kg) 2-row pale malt
1.5 lbs. (0.68 kg) flaked maize
1.0 lb. (0.45 kg) Vienna malt
1.4 lbs. (0.64 kg) Caramunich malt
10 oz. (0.28 kg) acid malt
8 oz. (0.23 kg) wheat malt
8 oz. (0.23 kg) biscuit malt
3 oz. (85 g) chocolate malt
2 oz. (57 g) Special B malt (160 °L)
1 lb. (0.45 kg) rice hulls
2 AAU Styrian Goldings hops (60 mins) (0.5 oz./14 g of 4% alpha acids)
4.6 AAU Northern Brewer hops (30 mins) (0.5 oz./14 g of 9.1% alpha acids)
2 AAU Styrian Goldings hops (5 mins) (0.5 oz./14 g of 4% alpha acids)
Wyeast 1028 (London Ale) yeast
Wyeast 3278 (Lambic Blend) culture
Wyeast 5526 (Brettanomyces lambicus) or White Labs WLP653 (Brettanomyces lambicus) yeast
1 1/4 cup light dried malt extract (for priming)

Step by Step
Mashed at 150 °F (66 °C) for 1 hour. Sparged with 170 °F (77 °C) water until I collected 6 gallons (23 L). Boiled down to 5 gallons (19 L). Pitched both Wyeast 1028 (London ale) and Wyeast Lambic Blend at the same time. I used a 1.6-qt. (1.5-L) starter made with dried malt extract. Primary fermentation lasted 4 weeks. Secondary around 6 months. I added a package of Wyeast Brettanomyces lambicus culture to the secondary at around 6 months I left it in secondary for 2 more months Bottled it with 11/4 cup dried malt extract.

Since I brewed the above Flemish Red, I’ve made 2 more, both in fermentation right now. I will not put them into secondary. I want the oxidation and yeast flavors to develop. I want to make the sour character as complex as I can. I am expecting two great Red ales, but will leave them both in fermentation for at least 2 years.

Ballantine was founded in New Jersey in 1840, making it one of the oldest brands of beer in the United States, and was at one time the third largest brewery in the country. In 2014 the brand was bought by Pabst Brewing Company, but this clone recipe is for the original Ballantine XXX, long the brewery’s most popular beer.

Ingredients
8 lbs. (3.6 kg) 6-row pale malt
2.5 lbs. (1.1 kg) flaked maize (corn)
1 lb. (0.45 kg) light Munich malt
8 oz. (0.23 kg) crystal malt (20 °L)

4 AAU Brewers Gold hops (25 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g of 8% alpha acids)
0.75 oz. (21 g) Brewers Gold hops (5 min.)
1 oz. (28 g) Cascade hops (dry hop)
1 tsp. Irish moss (15 min.)
Wyeast 1056 (American Ale), White Labs WLP001 (California Ale) or Fermentis Safale US-05 yeast (1.5 qt./1.4 L yeast starter)
3/4 cup (150 g) dextrose (if priming)

Step by Step
Mash the grains at 150 °F (66 °C) for 60 minutes. Mash out, vorlauf, and then sparge at 170 °F (77 °C) to collect enough wort to result in 5 gallons (19 L) after a 90-minute boil. Boil 90 minutes, adding hops at times indicated. Cool, aerate, and pitch yeast. Ferment at 68 °F (20 °C). After fermentation is complete, bottle or keg as usual.

Extract with grains option:
Substitute the 6-row pale malt, flaked maize, and Munich malts in the all-grain recipe with 7.25 lbs. (3.3 kg) American light lager liquid malt extract and 1 lb. (0.45 kg) Munich liquid malt extract. Steep grains in 5.5 gallons (21 L) 140–150 °F (60–66 °C) water for 30 minutes. Drain grains and add malt extracts as you bring to a boil for 90 minutes. Follow the remaining portion of the all-grain recipe.

Wyeast 1056 (American Ale), White Labs WLP001 (California Ale), or Safale US-05 yeast
2⁄3 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
This is a single infusion mash. Heat 4.5 gallons (17 L) of strike water for a mash ratio of about 1.25 quarts per pound of grain (2.6 L/kg). Target a mash temperature of 154 °F (68 °C) and hold for 60 minutes. Batch sparge with enough water to collect approximately 7 gallons (26.4 L) of wort runoff and bring to a boil. The goal is to get 5.5 gallons (21 L) of wort into the fermenter.

Boil the wort for 60 minutes adding the Nugget hops at the beginning, the yeast nutrients with 15 minutes left in the boil, and the Simcoe® hop addition with five minutes remaining in the boil. After turning off the heat, add the Amarillo® hops, then chill the wort to 68 °F (20 °C) and pitch the yeast, preferably as a 1.5-L yeast starter if pitching liquid yeast. Hold at this temperature for the duration of primary fermentation. Fermentation should take 10–14 days. Following fermentation, dry hop with Citra® hops for five days before bottling or transferring to keg. Prime to 2.4 volumes of CO2.

Steep the crushed grain in 2 gallons (7.6 L) of water as it warms until a temperature of about 170 °F (77 °C) is reached, or approximately 20 minutes. Remove the grains from the wort and rinse with 4 quarts (3.7 L) of hot water. Add the liquid to reach a total of 3 gallons (11.3 L) in the brew pot and bring the wort to a boil. Turn off the heat, add the liquid malt extract, and stir until completely dissolved. Return to heat and add the Nugget hops. With 15 minutes remaining in the boil, add the dried malt extract and yeast nutrients. Add the Simcoe® hop addition with five minutes remaining in the boil. After turning off the heat, add the Amarillo® hops and then rapidly chill the wort to room temperature. Transfer to a fermenter and top off to 5.5 gallons (21 L).
Pitch the yeast when the temperature of the wort is about 68 °F (20 °C). Preferably pitch the yeast as a 1.5-L starter if pitching liquid yeast. Hold the wort at this temperature for the duration of primary fermentation. Fermentation should take 10–14 days. Following fermentation, dry hop for five days before bottling or transferring to keg. Prime to 2.4 volumes of CO2.

Ingredients
6.75 lbs. (3.1 kg) pale liquid malt extract
1.25 lbs. (0.57 kg) Munich malt
0.75 lb. (0.34 kg) crystal malt (20 °L)
0.5 lb. (0.23 kg) crystal malt (40 °L)
13 AAU Nugget hops (60 min.) (1 oz./28 g at 13% alpha acids)
13 AAU Simcoe® hops (5 min.) (1 oz./28 g at 13% alpha acids)
9 AAU Amarillo® hops (0 min.) (1 oz./28 g at 9% alpha acids)
1 oz. (28 g) Citra® hops (dry hop)
Wyeast 1056 (American Ale) or White Labs WLP001 (California Ale) or Safale US-05 yeast
3⁄4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Bring 5.6 gallons (21.2 L) of water to approximately 162 °F (72 °C) and hold there, and steep milled specialty grains in grain bags for 15 minutes. Remove the grain bags, and let drain fully. Add liquid extract while stirring, and stir until completely dissolved. Bring the wort to a boil. Boil for 60 minutes, adding hops according to the ingredient list.

After the boil, turn off heat and whirlpool for 15 minutes. Then chill the wort to slightly below fermentation temperature, about 65 °F (18 °C). Aerate the wort with pure oxygen or filtered air and pitch yeast.

Ferment at 69 °F (21 °C) for six days. Add the dry hops and hold at 69 °F (21 °C) for four more days. Once the beer reaches terminal gravity, bottle or keg the beer and carbonate to approximately 2.5 volumes. You may want to cold-crash the beer prior to packaging to 35 °F (2 °C) for 48 hours to improve clarity.

IBU = 53 SRM = 48 ABV = 9.3%

There are several ways to try to get peanut butter flavor into this beer such as de-oiling natural peanut butter, adding peanut butter extract or using peanut butter powder. For this recipe I decided to use the extract which can be found in many homebrew shops.

Ingredients
4.5 lbs. (2 kg) 2-row pale malt
4 lbs. (1.8 kg) German Pilsner malt
4 lbs. (1.8 kg) wheat malt
1.2 lb. (0.54 kg) flaked oats
8 oz. (0.23 kg) flaked wheat
1 lb. (0.45 kg) crystal malt (60 °L)
8 oz. (0.23 kg) dextrine malt
1 lb. (0.45 kg) Belgian Special B malt
1 lb. (0.45 kg) British chocolate malt (450 °L)
4 oz. (113 g) roasted barley (500 °L)
1 lb. (0.45 kg) lactose sugar (0 min.)
8 oz. (0.23 kg) maltodextrin (0 min.)
7.1 AAU Fuggle hops (60 min.) (1.5 oz./42 g at 4.75% alpha acids)
7.5 AAU Kent Golding hops (60 min.) (1.5 oz./42 g at 5% alpha acids)
2.4 AAU Fuggle hops (15 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 4.75% alpha acids)
2.5 AAU Kent Golding hops (15 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 5% alpha acids)
1 tsp. Irish moss (15 min.)
1/2 tsp. yeast nutrient (15 min.)
1 stick licorice
6 oz. (170 g) Hershey’s dark cocoa powder
2 vanilla beans
2-4 oz. (57-118 g) peanut butter extract
Wyeast 1084 (Irish Ale) or White Labs WLP004 (Irish Ale) yeast
2/3 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Start by toasting the flaked oats for 30 min. at 325 °F (162 °C) or until they have an aroma reminiscent of oatmeal cookies. Mash at 149 °F (65 °C) for 90 minutes in 5.5 gallons (21 L) water. Bring mash temperature up to 168 °F (78 °C) and sparge with enough water to collect 7 gallons (26.5 L) wort in the brewpot. Boil 90 minutes adding hops as indicated. With 15 minutes remaining in the boil, add the yeast nutrients and Irish moss. At the end of the boil, add the lactose sugar, maltodextrine, half the cocoa powder, the stick of licorice and one vanilla bean. Give the wort a stir and let settle for 15 minutes.

Chill the wort and transfer to the fermenter. Pitch yeast between 68 °F–72 °F (20–22 °C). In 3 to 7 days, after fermentation has slowed down and the kräusen has settled, add the 2 oz. (59 ml) of the peanut butter extract, the second half of cocoa powder, and the second vanilla bean, preferably soaked in either vodka or bourbon (your choice). Condition for 2 -4 weeks. Add more peanut butter extract to taste at the time of bottling or kegging.

Pear Ginger Kombucha
Pear Ginger Kombucha
(16 oz./470-mL)

Hands down the MOST popular flavor of kombucha is ginger. Humans and ginger have a love affair as the piquant flavor not only intrigues the tongue but its digestive properties also settle the stomach. Before Prohibition, ginger beer was the most popular beverage in the United States and then became ginger ale once alcohol was outlawed. Enjoy the zippy zing of ginger by adding some to your kombucha! Pears provide a sweet, floral and fall flavor for the brew; of course any other type of fruit may be substituted in place of pears.

Ingredients
15 oz. (440 mL) kombucha
1 tsp. ginger juice or 1 Tbls. fresh ginger or 1 1⁄2 tsp. dried ginger pieces
1 Tbls. fresh, frozen, or canned pear, diced. Alternatively, you could use 1 1⁄2 tsp. pear juice

Step by step

Combine the ingredients in a 16-oz. (470-mL) bottle and cap tightly. Allow it to sit at room temperature for 1 to 3 days and then move to the fridge (if desired) to slow fermentation. If leaving the pieces in the bottle, consume within a week or it may be strained and stored for longer.

Tips for Success:

Ginger comes in many formats and they are all delicious providing varying levels of bite. For the most intense ginger flavor, use ginger juice. For a mellower flavor, cut up a thumb of ginger and use chunks or pieces. Since it’s more intense, less juice is needed than the pieces, so adjust the recipe according to your personal taste preference. The suggestions below are just that — use as a starting point and then tweak as desired.

Anderson Valley Brewing Co.’s Blood Orange Gose clone
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.038 FG = 1.005
IBU = 12 SRM = 3 ABV = 4.4%

Anderson Valley has become well-known for their variety of fruited Goses. This example uses blood orange juice that imparts tangy citrus notes that complement the Champagne-like flavors.

Ingredients
5.5 lbs. (2.5 kg) 2-row pale malt
2.4 lbs. (1.1 kg) malted white wheat
~2 oz. (57 g) rice hulls
0.43 lb. (195 g) blood orange juice concentrate
3.3 AAU Nugget hops (60 min) (0.25 oz./7g at 13.1% alpha acids)
0.016 oz. (0.45 g) Indian coriander (fine ground) (5 min.)
0.61 oz. (17.2 g) sea salt
Lactobacillus culture, such as Wyeast 5335, White Labs WLP672, or WildBrew™ Sour Pitch
White Labs WLP029 (German Ale/Kölsch) or Wyeast 1007 (German Ale) or SafAle K-97 yeast
3⁄4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by step
Mash in at 150 °F (66 °C) with the grains and rice hulls. Rest 60 minutes and lauter as normal. As the kettle fills, begin to introduce an inert gas (usually nitrogen, but CO2 works well too) into the top of the kettle. Stop runoff at 1.008. Once the wort is in the kettle, mix in cooled water to achieve a temperature of 118 °F (48 °C) — or recommended pitch temperature from the manufacturer — and a gravity of about 1.034. Add Lactobacillus propagation. Pitching rate is ~500 mL at 1 x 108 cells per mL (or approximately 5 x 1010 total). Allow to sour to desired pH (between 3.3–3.4). Hold at the recommended souring temperature. Once the pH is reached, boil the wort for 45 minutes, adding hops at beginning of the boil and the coriander at the end.

Pitch German ale yeast at 68–70 °F (20–21°C). Add the blood orange juice concentrate near the end of active fermentation. At the end of fermentation add the fully hydrated salt solution. Bottle and prime or keg and force carbonate as usual.

Extract only option: Rice hulls are not needed. Swap out the pale and wheat malts for 2.2 lbs. (1 kg) wheat dried malt extract and 2 lbs. (0.91 kg) extra light dried malt extract. Heat 23 qts. (22 L) to 180 °F (82 °C) and stir in the dried malt extract. Hold at this temperature for 15 minutes for pasteurization, then cool wort to Lacto pitching temperature. Follow all-grain instructions for the remainder of the steps.

Pedal Haus Brewery's Barrel-Aged Quad Clone
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.094 FG = 1.011
IBU = 18 SRM = 19 ABV = 10.6%

Ingredients
13 lbs. (5.9 kg) 2-row pale malt
11 oz. (0.25 kg) dark Munich malt (30 °L)
5.5 oz. (160 g) melanoidin malt
12.5 oz. (0.35 kg) Simpsons DRC malt
3 oz. (84 g) crystal malt (75 °L)
1 oz. (28 g) acidulated malt
1.6 lbs. (0.73 kg) dextrose (corn sugar)
0.63 lbs. (0.29 kg) amber candi syrup
0.63 lbs. (0.29 kg) amber dried malt extract
3.3 AAU Magnum hops (90 min.) (0.25 oz./7 g at 13.1% alpha acids)
2 AAU Magnum hops (40 min.) (0.15 oz./4 g at 13.1% alpha acids)
1 oz. (28 g) American oak chips (Bourbon-soaked)
Wyeast 3787 (Belgian High Gravity), White Labs WLP530 (Abbey Ale), or Mangrove Jack’s M41 (Belgian Ale) yeast
7⁄8 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
In advance of brew day, submerge your oak chips in your favorite Bourbon for a minimum of two weeks.

Using a thick mash of 1.25 qts./lb. (2.6 L/kg) of grain, mix grains (not the sugars) with 4.66 gallons (17.6 L) of water. Mash in, targeting an initial temperature at 112 °F (44 °C) for a beta glucan rest. Once the grain is added, add 1 tsp. of gypsum and a 1/2 tsp. of calcium chloride. Hold at this temperature for 20 minutes. Raise temperature to 149 °F (65 °C) and hold at this rest for 20 minutes. Raise temperature to 158 °F (70 °C) and hold for 30 minutes. Once mash is complete, mashout for 10 minutes at 170 °F (77 °C).

Recirculate until clear, and then begin collecting wort. With the goal of achieving 5.5 gallons (20.8 L) of wort after boil (which will yield a 5-gallon/19-L batch), collect 7.9 gallons (29.8 L) of wort since this beer requires a long boil. The 120-minute boil is necessary to develop the depth of malt flavor while also helping with color development. Add the malt extract and the first hops addition at the 90-minute mark, then the second hop addition at the 40 minute mark. Add the sugar and syrup in the last 5 minutes of the boil. Whirlpool vigorously and let settle for 20 minutes before chilling.

Chill the wort to 66 °F (19 °C). Pitch your yeast starter and oxygenate thoroughly. Primary fermentation should take five days. Upon completion of primary, raise the temperature to 72 °F (22 °C) and add your Bourbon-soaked oak chips to replicate barrel aging. Hold at this temperature for 21 more days to fully develop the complex flavors of the beer. (Note: If fermentation stalls well short of the goal, it’s OK to pitch a second helping of neutral yeast, such as SafAle US-05, WLP001 or Wyeast 1056. Just do not oxygenate during the second pitching. If you do a second yeast pitch, give that five days to finish primary then begin the secondary fermentation process mentioned above.) When fermentation is complete, bottle or keg and carbonate to 2.8 v/v.

(5 gallons/19 L, partial mash)
OG = 1.094 FG = 1.011
IBU = 18 SRM = 19 ABV = 10.6%

Ingredients
7.5 lbs. (3.4 kg) Briess pale ale dried malt extract
11 oz. (0.25 kg) dark Munich malt (30 °L)
5.5 oz. (160 g) melanoidin malt
12.5 oz. (0.35 kg) Simpsons DRC malt
3 oz. (84 g) crystal malt (75 °L)
1.6 lbs. (0.73 kg) dextrose (corn sugar)
0.63 lbs. (0.29 kg) amber candi syrup
0.63 lbs. (0.29 kg) amber dried malt extract
3.3 AAU Magnum hops (60 min.) (0.25 oz./7 g at 13.1% alpha acids)
2 AAU Magnum hops (40 min.) (0.15 oz./4 g at 13.1% alpha acids)
1 oz. (28 g) American oak chips (Bourbon-soaked)
Wyeast 3787 (Belgian High Gravity), White Labs WLP530 (Abbey Ale), or Mangrove Jack’s M41 (Belgian Ale) yeast
7⁄8 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
In advance of brew day, submerge your oak chips in your favorite Bourbon for a minimum of two weeks.

Bring 2 gallons (7.6 L) up to about 160 °F (70 °C). Place all the pale, Munich, and melanoidon malts in a muslin bag and steep for about 30 minutes. Add the crystal malts to a separate muslin bag and steep in the wort for an additional 15 minutes (45 minutes total). After, place all the grains in a colander and wash with 2 gallons (7.6 L) of hot water. Raise the temperature to near-boiling, then remove from heat and add the two malt extracts while stirring vigorously. Return to a boil and boil 60 minutes adding the hops as indicated, and add the sugar and syrup in the last 5 minutes of the boil.

Once the boil is complete, top up with water with the goal of achieving 5.5 gallons (20.8 L) of wort, which will yield a 5-gallon (19-L) batch after fermentation is complete. Follow the remaining all-grain instructions for fermentation and packaging.

Tips For Success:
For the malts, Brewmaster Derek "Doc" Osborne uses Simpsons DRC, which is very similar to Special B malt. Substitute if the Simpsons DRC is unavailable. If you cannot find Munich 30 °L, using dark Munich at 20 °L will suffice. Crystal 75 can be exchanged for Crystal 77 or Crystal 80, depending on what is available to you.

Anytime you are brewing beers >10% ABV, fermentation control is of the utmost importance. The yeast has to work really hard to ferment this much sugar, and temperatures can rise quickly, producing alcohols with higher molecular weight that can leave off-flavors in your beer. It’s vital to pitch enough yeast and oxygenate thoroughly to ensure the yeast can do its job. Also oxygenate for a couple minutes. Doc says it’s okay to add an additional burst of oxygen on day two as long as alcohol production has not yet started. This second oxygen addition can give the boost it needs to tackle such a big beer.

Pedal Haus Brewery's Maple Milk Stout clone
PEDAL HAUS BREWERY’S MAPLE MILK STOUT CLONE
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.053 FG = 1.019
IBU = 23 SRM = 36 ABV = 5.5%

Pedal Haus Brewery (Tempe, Arizona) adds an extra layer of intrigue to their milk stout with a big addition of maple syrup near the end of fermentation. This recipe’s original gravity (OG) is based on the estimated gravity reading at the time the yeast is pitched. The ABV is calculated based on the inclusion of the maple syrup to the fermentation.

INGREDIENTS
8.5 lbs. (3.9 kg) pale malt
0.4 lb. (0.18 kg) Weyermann Carafa® III malt
0.4 lb. (0.18 kg) Simpsons roasted barley
0.4 lb. (0.18 kg) Simpsons DRC™ malt
0.4 lb. (0.18 kg) flaked barley
5.6 AAU Magnum hops (60 min.) (0.4 oz./11 g at 14% alpha acids)
1.5 AAU Delta hops (15 min.) (0.3 oz./9 g at 5% alpha acids)
0.7 lb. (0.32 kg) lactose sugar (60 min.)
1 lb. (0.45 kg) Vermont robust grade maple syrup (fermenter) White Labs WLP002 (English Ale),
Wyeast 1968 (London ESB Ale), or Lallemand London ESB Ale yeast
2⁄3 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Mash in to achieve temperature of 158 °F (70 °C). This temperature allows alpha amylase to be active but inhibits beta amylase so the resulting beer is slightly sweeter. Hold 30 minutes for conversion. Raise to 168 °F (76 °C) for mashout. Hold 10 minutes. Sparge with enough water to collect 6 gallons (23 L).

Add lactose powder and first hop addition at start of boil. Boil 60 minutes total, adding the Delta hops with 15 minutes remaining.

Chill to 64 °F (18 °C), aerate, and then pitch yeast. Ferment at 64 °F (18 °C) through primary, then let rise to 66°F (19 °C). Add the maple syrup when primary is slowed but still has minor activity. It will ferment the sugar but retain some aromatics. Condition for two weeks then rack to bottles or keg at 2.3 volumes.

A traditional Vienna-style lager with a delicate malt balance from Pedal Haus Brewery in Tempe, Arizona.

Ingredients
5.25 lbs. (2.4 kg) Weyermann Vienna malt
4.5 lbs. (2 kg) Weyermann Pilsnermalt
3 oz. (85 g) Weyermann Caramunich® III malt (56 °L)
1 oz. (28 g) Weyermann Carafoam® malt
0.15 oz. (4.25 g) Weyermann Carafa® III malt
3 AAU German Hallertau Tradition (70 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 6%alpha acids)
3 AAU German Hallertau Tradition (20 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g. at 6%alpha acids)
1⁄2 tsp. Irish moss (15 min.)
White Labs WLP830 (German Lager) or Wyeast 2124 (Bohemian Lager) or Saflager W-34/70 yeast
3⁄4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
If possible, use soft or reverse osmosis water. Target a protein rest at 121 °F (49 °C) for 20 min., raise to 147 °F (64 °C) for 20 min., then 154 °F (68 °C) for 20 min., then 170 °F (77 °C). Target 4.5 to 5 gallons (17 to 19 L) of water in the mash. Collect ~5.6 gallons (21 L) in the kettle and boil for 70 minutes. Conduct a vigorous boil to maximize evaporation. Add kettle finings at 15 minutes. At flameout, allow to rest and whirlpool gently for 20 minutes. If you have an immersion chiller, it’s good to drop the temperature to limit the Dimethyl Sulfide (DMS) production and coagulate the proteins but don’t go below 180 °F (82 °C) if the kettle is open to the environment. Cool to 48 °F (9 °C), aerate, and pitch yeast.

Allow temperature to rise to 52 °F (11 °C) during fermentation. After gravity has been terminal for over a week and has no diacetyl detectable using a forced diacetyl test, gradually drop the temperature to 43 °F (6 °C) and lager 3–4 weeks. Drop the temperatures slowly so the yeast is not stressed or put to sleep. Force carbonate or bottle condition to 2.5 volumes.

Step by Step
Heat 2 gallons (7.6 L) of water to 157 °F (69 °C) and submerge large steeping bag with the crushed grains. Mash for 45 minutes at 149 °F (65 °C). Remove bag and sparge with 170 °F (77 °C) water to collect 2.5 gallons (9.5 L) of wort.

Top off kettle with water to make 3 gallons (11 L) and add the Pilsen dried malt extract. Boil wort for 60 minutes adding hops according to the schedule. Add Goldpils® malt extract in the last 15 minutes of the boil. Follow the remaining all-grain instructions with an exception to top off fermenter with pre-chilled water after cooling and transferring wort to bring volume up to 5 gallons (19 L).

Tips for Success:

"There is some debate to the value of a protein rest and a great beer can be made either way. We do it and we found pleasant benefits that the wort gained through the heating process while ramping. If your mash tun doesn’t have a heat source, consider decocting to ramp up as it will add a color and aroma that is outstanding for the style."

"During the 3–4 week lagering period, the acetaldehyde and the sulfur will reduce. The acetaldehyde will come back up a little during packaging due to oxygen so lager longer than you think you need to. We force carbonate post-filtration but you can bottle during the beginning of the lager phase using some priming sugar and some fresh lager yeast allowing the beer to mature and carbonate in the bottles on their side at a controlled temperature."

After the boil and whirlpool, chill the wort to slightly below fermentation temperature, about 66 °F (19 °C). Aerate the wort with pure oxygen or filtered air and pitch yeast.
Ferment at 68 °F (20 °C) for seven days, then free rise to 72 °F (22 °C) until the completion of primary fermentation. Follow the remaining instructions from the all-grain recipe for fermentation schedule and packaging advice.

TIPS FOR SUCCESS:
Head Brewer Chris Long notes that the key to this beer is to make it as clean as possible. If the roast is too intense even with just the Carafa® Special III, switch to Briess Midnight Wheat for color correction. Be sure to pitch a healthy amount of yeast (PEI uses one million cells per milliliter per degree Plato, which for this recipe would equate to about 300 billion cells, or roughly 3 vials of liquid yeast or one vial in a 2 liter starter) to minimize any ester or off-flavor production. And be sure to serve this beer fresh and take steps to avoid cold-side oxidation. Purge any vessels you are transferring the beer into with CO2 before you begin the transfer process.

Good luck!

This barleywine is the winner of numerous awards, including a gold medal at the World Beer Cup in 2012. Features aromas and tastes of toasted malt, toffee, and caramel, with a warming finish.

Ingredients

15 lb. 9 oz. (7.1 kg) Golden Promise pale malt
7 lb. 7 oz. (3.4 kg) Munich malt
1 lb. 11 oz. (0.75 kg) melanoidin malt
1 lb. 15 oz. (0.88 kg) caramel malt blend (Pelican uses a blend of four different caramel malts, ranging from 15 to 120 °L — pick four that cover this range and add roughly 0.5 lb./0.23 kg of each)
1 lb. (0.45 kg) torrified wheat
6.0 AAU Magnum hops (60 min.) (0.50 oz./14 g of 12% alpha acids)
5.6 AAU Golding hops (30 min.) (1.4 oz./40 g of 4% alpha acids)
2.6 oz. (75 g) Hersbrucker hops (whirlpool)
0.88 oz. (25 g) Golding hops (whirlpool)
Wyeast 1968 (London ESB) or White Labs WLP002 (English Ale) yeast
3/4 cup (150 g) dextrose (if priming)

Step by Step

Mash the grains at 138 °F (59 °C) for 90 minutes with a liquor-to-grist ratio of 2.4-to-1. Mash out, vorlauf, and then sparge at 170 °F (77 °C) to collect wort until run-off extract is about SG 1.040 (10 °Plato). Below that and you are adding too much water (which you are going to have to boil away). Typical boil times for Stormwatcher’s are 4 hours, with an overall evaporation rate of about 35%. Add hops at times indicated. Chill, aerate, and pitch yeast at a rate of about 50–60 million cells per milliliter. Ferment at 65–66 °F (18–19 °C) until complete (at 80% apparent attenuation). Remove finishing beer from yeast after first week to ward off autolysis. When finished, carbonate to 2.5 volumes of CO2. This beer should continue to mature and evolve for months and years.

Partial mash option:

Substitute the Golden Promise malt, Munich malt, and terrified wheat in the all-grain recipe with 8.5 lbs. (3.9 kg) Coopers light dried malt extract and 5 lbs. (2.3 kg) Briess liquid Munich malt extract. Place crushed grains in a large steeping bag and steep at 148 °F (64 °C) for 45 minutes in 5 qts. (4.7 L) of liquid. Rinse grains with 5 qts. (4.7 L) of water at 170 °F (77 °C). Add water to the "grain tea" to make 6 gallons (23 L). Stir in malt extracts and bring to a boil for 60 minutes. Follow the remaining portion of the all-grain recipe.

Pelican’s Midnight Malt takes the structure of a classic, balanced porter and turns the complexity knob up just slightly with the rich character of dark chocolate. Brewed with Meridian Cacao Company nibs sourced directly from cacao farmers in Tanzania, this clone recipe can be adapted by using a range of cocoa nib varieties, based on the brewer’s preference. Malts like Midnight Wheat offer an overall smoother mouthfeel and more refined roast character, with a grain bill designed to strike a balance between sweet, bitter, and roasty. Adapted from an earlier porter recipe (a draft-only exclusive, at the time), the base recipe of Midnight Malt makes for an ideal springboard into more adventurous adaptations, or simply a reliably easy-drinking porter ideal for all cold weather months.

Ingredients
10 lbs. (4.5 kg) 2-row pale malt
1 lb. (0.45 kg) crystal malt (80 °L)
14 oz. (400 g) flaked barley
9 oz. (255 g) Briess Blackprinz® malt (or Carafa® Special III) malt
9 oz. (255 g) Briess Midnight Wheat malt
9 AAU Magnum hops (60 min.) (0.75 oz./21 g at 12% alpha acids)
6–8 oz. (170–225 g) Tanzanian cocoa nibs
White Labs WLP001 (California Ale), Wyeast 1056 (American Ale), or Mangrove Jack’s M44 (US West Coast) yeast
3⁄4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by step
Several days before brew day, begin soaking the cocoa nibs in vodka, using just enough to cover the nibs. Cover and store at room temperature.

Mash grains at 154 °F (68 °C) for 60 minutes. Begin lautering by bringing the mash up to a mash-out temperature of 168 °F (70 °F) and hold for 10 minutes. Begin recirculating, vorlaufing until the wort runs clear then direct runoff to the boil kettle.

Boil for 60 minutes, adding the hops at the beginning of the boil. Chill wort and ferment at 68 °F (20 °C) until primary fermentation is complete. Transfer to secondary and add cocoa nibs along with the vodka. Allow for 3–5 days of contact time in order to extract the full flavor profile. After this, transfer beer to keg or bottle.

1879 Dublin XXX Stout
(5 gallon/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.086 FG = 1.015
IBU = 87 SRM = 55 ABV = 9.1%

A large stout, what today would be called a foreign extra stout, was made in Dublin in 1879. Most assuredly, there would also be a little sourness brought on by Brettanomyces, giving this beer a finishing acidic twang.

Ingredients

10.25 lbs. (4.7 kg) British 2-row pale malt (2-row)
1.0 lb. (0.45 kg) crystal malt (75 °L)
1.5 lbs. (0.68 kg) roasted barley
3.5 lbs. (1.6 kg) corn sugar
10 AAU Fuggle hops (120 mins)(2.0 oz./57 g of 5% alpha acids)
10 AAU Fuggle hops (60 mins) (2.0 oz./57 g of 5% alpha acids)
2.0 oz. (57 g) Fuggle hops (10 mins)
Fermentis Safale S-04 yeast

Step by Step

Mash grains at 154 °F (68 °C) in 11.5 qts. (11 L) of water. Boil for 120 minutes, adding hops at times indicated and sugar for final 15 minutes. Ferment at 68 °F (20 °C). As an option, you can add a Brettanomyces culture once the primary fermentation slows.

Countertop partial mash option:
Reduce amount of British pale malt to 3.0 lbs. (4.7 kg) and add 2.0 lbs (0.91 kg) of Muntons Light dried malt extract and 2.75 lbs. (1.3 kg) of John Bull light liquid malt extract (late addition).

Begin by heating 5.5 qts. (5.2 L) of soft or distilled water to 165 °F (74 °C) in a large kitchen pot. Stir 1⁄2 tsp. of calcium sulfate (gypsum) or calcium chloride into this water. In another pot, heat 2.25 qts. (2.1 L) of soft water to around 164 °F (73 °C). Stir 1 tsp. calcium carbonate (chalk) or 1⁄2 tsp. sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) into this water. In your brewpot, begin heating a half-gallon (~2 L) of water to around 170 °F (77 °C). Place crushed pale and crystal malts in one grain bag and place in cooler. Put remaining roasted barley (crushed) in the other bag. Add the 5.5 qts. (5.2 L) of water to the malts in the cooler and stir it in. Let this mash, starting at 154 °F (68 °C), for 45 minutes. Likewise, steep the specialty grains in the pot of carbonate-rich water for 45 minutes (around 153 °F/67 °C), although this exact temperature is not critical. While grains mash and steep, heat about 8.0 qts. (7.6 L) of water to 180 °F (82 °C).

When mashing and steeping is complete, scoop 1 qt. (~1 L) of 170 °F (77 °C) water from your brewpot with a large measuring cup or beer pitcher. Lift the specialty grains out of their steeping pot and place them in a colander over your brewpot. Pour the "grain tea" through the grain bag (to strain out any large bits of grain) and then rinse the grains with the water pulled from your brewpot. Start heating this "grain tea" while you collect the wort from the cooler.

To collect wort from mash, recirculate about 2.5 qts. (2.4 L) of wort, then add 180 °F (82 °C) water to cooler until it is full to the rim. Draw off wort and add to brewpot until the liquid level in the cooler is just above the grain bed. Add 180 °F (82 °C) water to the rim again. Repeat this process until you have collected 2.0 gallons/8 qts. (7.6 L) of wort. Add dried malt extract and bring wort to a boil. Add first dose of hops and boil for 60 minutes.

Add hops at times indicated in the ingredient list. Stir in sugar and liquid malt extract for the final 15 minutes of the boil. Cool wort, in sink or with wort chiller, to 70 °F (21 °C) and transfer to fermenter. Add water to top up to 5 gallons (19 L), aerate and pitch yeast. Ferment at 68 °F (20 °C). As an option, you can add a Brettanomyces culture once the primary fermentation slows to a halt.

Step by Step
For mashing in, you will need 6.0 gallons (23 L) of strike water. Mash at 149 °F (65 °C) for 60 minutes. Mash out to 165 °F (74 °C). Recirculate and collect wort. Collect enough to be able to boil wort for 90 minutes. (Fully sparged, you would get at least 10 gallons/38 L out of the grain bed, but then you would have to boil your wort longer to concentrate it. If you boil less than you can get from the grain bed, you may have to supplement the wort with a little malt extract to reach your target OG.) Boil wort to reduce volume to 5 gallons (19 L), adding hops and other spices at times indicated. Chill and transfer to fermenter. Aerate and pitch yeast sediment from yeast starter. Ferment at 68–70 °F (20–21 °C). Transfer to secondary and add dry hops and figs, then 4 days later add the oak chips; 3 days after that, package the beer.

Step by Step
For this partial mash recipe, you’ll need two large grain steeping bags and a 2-gallon (7.6-L) beverage cooler. Place the 4.0 lbs. (1.8 kg) of 2-row pale malt in one steeping bag and the remaining specialty grains in the other. In the cooler, mash the pale malt grains at 149 °F (65 °C) for 60 minutes. This will take 5.5 quarts (5.2 L) of water. In your brewpot, steep the specialty grains at 149 °F (65 °C) in 4.5 qqts. (4.2 L) of water while you are mashing. Collect wort from the cooler in the following manner. Collect one cup of wort from the spigot, then add one cup of hot sparge water to the top of the cooler and repeat until you collect around 2.0 gallons (7.6 L) of wort. Use ~190 °F (88 °C) water for sparging, but don’t let the temperature of the grain bed rise above 170 °F (77 °C). As you collect the wort, add it to your brewpot, where the specialty grains are steeping (and still being held at 149 °F/65 °C). Once all the wort is collected from the cooler, add water to brewpot to make at least 3.5 gallons (13 L) of wort, stir in dried malt extract and bring to a boil. Boil wort for 90 minutes, adding hops and other spices at times indicated. Stir in liquid malt extract during the final 15 minutes of the boil. (Stir well to avoid scorching malt extract.) Cool wort and transfer to fermenter. Top up to 5.0 gallons (19 L) with cool water, aerate well and pitch yeast. Ferment at 68–70 °F (20–21 °C). Transfer to secondary and add dry hops and figs, then 4 days later add the oak chips; 3 days after that, package the beer.

Extract with grains option:
Omit 2-row pale malt from partial mash recipe and increase liquid malt extract to a total of 8.5 lbs. (3.9 kg) Place specialty grains in a steeping bag. In a large (at least 6 qt./6 L) kitchen pot, steep grains at 149 °F (65 °C) for 60 minutes in 1.1 gallons (4.2 L) of water. Begin heating at least 2.0 gallons (7.6 L) of water in your brewpot as the grains steep. Rinse grains with 2.0 qts. (1.9 L) of 170 °F (77 °C) water and add "grain tea" to water in brewpot. Stir in dried malt extract and bring wort to a boil. Boil for 90 minutes, adding hops and spices at times indicated. Stir in liquid malt extract during the final 15 minutes of the boil. (Stir well to avoid scorching malt extract.) Cool wort and transfer to fermenter. Top up to 5.0 gallons (19 L) with cool water, aerate well and pitch yeast. Ferment at 68–70 °F (20–21 °C). Transfer to secondary and add dry hops and figs, then 4 days later add the oak chips; 3 days after that, package the beer.

Tips for Success:
This is a big beer, be sure to make a yeast starter with enough volume to grow a sufficient number of cells to ferment the wort efficiently — a minimum of roughly 3 qts. (3 L), but optimally twice that. Barring that, 17 g of Fermentis US-05 dried yeast would also work. Aerate the wort well and consider adding yeast nutrients in the final 15 minutes of the boil.

Getting the right amount of spice in a beer can be tricky. Consider adding half of the amount of each of the spices listed here, and soaking the remaining spices in vodka. If, when it comes time to bottle or keg the beer, the beer seems underspiced, add some or all of the vodka.

When adding the figs, put these in a dry hopping bag and do not add the bourbon used for soaking to the beer.

New Old Timer’s Bock
(6 gallon/23 L, partial mash)
OG = 1.060 FG = 1010
IBU = 22 SRM = 13 ABV = 6.4%

This recipe is based on the all-grain recipe by Terry Foster in the October 2019 issue of BYO called Old Timer’s Bock. It shows how I would create a partial mash recipe using malt extract in place of much of the base malt in Terry’s recipe, however keep the use of flaked maize, which Terry’s extract-only option did not do. This should result in a beer closer in flavor to the all-grain version, but allow for a shortened brew day that requires less equipment than all-grain brewing does.

Ingredients
5 lbs. (2.27 kg) pale dried malt extract
1 lb. (454 g) pale ale malt
1.75 lbs. (0.79 kg) crystal malt (60 °L)
3 lbs. (1.36 kg) flaked maize
7.3 AAU Cluster hops (60 min.) (1 oz./28g at 7.3% alpha acids)
1 gram Whirlfloc® (15 min.)
1⁄4 tsp. (7 grams) amylase enzyme
White Labs WLP820 (Oktoberfest/Märzen Lager) or Wyeast 2206 (Bavarian Lager) or SafLager S-23 yeast
2⁄3 cups corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Several days before brew day, either do a 4-L starter, unless using dried yeast, in which case you will want to use two 11.5-gram packages. Using reverse osmosis (RO) water, treat all of your brewing water to a pH of 5.5 using phosphoric or lactic acid. Be prepared to heat two separate pots with 2 gallons (8 L) of water, adding 1⁄4 tsp. of calcium chloride and 1⁄4 tsp. of calcium sulfate (gypsum) to each. In one pot, heat your mash water to 162 °F (72 °C), then add your grain in a bag, stabilize to 150 °F (66 °C), and add 1⁄4 tsp. (7 g) of amylase enzyme to the mash. The amylase enzyme will help in converting the flaked maize within a 45-minute time period.

While your grains are mashing, the other 2 gallons (8 L) of water should be heated to 170 °F (77 °C). This is to help save time while brewing.

Take a small sample of your mash liquid and check for conversion with iodine. Once conversion has been verified, take your bag of grains out and give them a quick soak in your brew kettle to rinse the remaining sugars from the grain. Now gently squeeze your grains to remove the excess liquid. When done with grain rinsing, add the liquid from the mash pot to the brew kettle. Your volume in your brew kettle will be under 4 gallons (15 L). Bring your wort to a boil. Keep the lid mostly on the kettle with a space of an inch or two (3–5 cm) uncovered during the boil. Add the hops and Whirlfloc® as indicated in the ingredients.

At the end of your boil the volume will be closer to 3 gallons (9.5 L). Remove the kettle from heat and add all the malt extract to the wort. Stir until all of the extract is dissolved.

With an immersion chiller or cold water bath method, cool the wort to 80–85 °F (27–29 °C). Now dump the wort into the bottling bucket and add refrigerated RO water to the 6-gallon (23-L) mark to aid in the cooling of the wort. Allow to rest for one hour, with the bottling bucket tilted so that the spigot side of the bucket is slightly elevated so the trub slides to the opposite side of the bucket. After an hour, open spigot of the bottling bucket, capture the first pint of wort before allowing the rest of the wort to flow into your fermenter. Add the yeast when filling the fermenter.

Ferment at 52 °F (11 °C) and do a diacetyl rest for a day or two upon completion. Transfer and lager at 32 °F (0 °C) for three weeks. Keg and force carbonate or prime and bottle condition as usual. I would use fresh yeast if bottling with corn sugar.

Tips for Success:
I have tested my RO water and my tests show it has a pH of 6, so I do not do any adjustments with phosphoric acid to my water. The RO water you use may have a different pH, so it should be checked and brought to 5.5 if it is not already close.

Altbier
(6 gallons/23 L, partial mash)
OG = 1.052 FG = 1.012
IBU = 49 SRM = 19 ABV = 5.1%

This recipe is based on the all-grain recipe by Gordon Strong in the January-February 2019 issue of BYO and shows how I would approach the recipe as a partial mash, replacing much of the base malt with malt extract allows for a shortened brew day that requires less equipment than all-grain brewing does.

Ingredients
6.6 lbs. (3 kg) Pilsner liquid malt extract
1.56 lbs. (0.71 kg) Munich malt
0.5 lb. (227 g) red wheat malt
0.75 lb. (340 g) melanoidin malt
0.31 lb. (140 g) crystal malt (60 °L)
0.31 lb. (140 g) debittered black malt
14.6 AAU Perle hops (60 min.) (2 oz./57 g at 7.3% alpha acids)
1.6 AAU Spalt hops (10 min.) (0.5 oz./14 g at 3.2% alpha acids)
0.5 oz. (14 g) Spalt hops (0 min.)
1 gram Whirlfloc® (15 min.)
White Labs WLP036 (Dusseldorf Alt Ale) or Wyeast 1007 (German Ale) or SafAle K-97 yeast
3⁄4 cup corn sugar (if priming)

Step by Step
Using reverse osmosis (RO) water, treat all of your brewing water to a pH of 5.5 using phosphoric or lactic acid. Be prepared to heat two separate pots, one with 7 qts. (6.6 L) and the other with 2 gallons (7.6 L) of water, adding 1⁄4 tsp. of calcium chloride and 1⁄4 tsp. of calcium sulfate (gypsum) to each. Heat the pot with 7 quarts (6.6 L) of water to 156 °F (69 °C) and add all of the bagged grains to be mashed. Verify strike temperature is 144 °F (62 °C) and allow to stand for 25 minutes. While your grains are mashing, heat 2 gallons (8 L) of water to 170 °F (77 °C). This is to help save time while brewing.

Take a small sample of your mash liquid and check for conversion with iodine. Once conversion has been verified, remove your bag of grains and give them a quick soak in your brew kettle to rinse the remaining sugars from the grain. Now gently squeeze your grains to remove the excess liquid. Add the liquid from the mash pot to the brew kettle. Your volume in your brew kettle will be under 4 gallons (15 L).

Boil 60 minutes, keeping the lid mostly on the kettle with a space of an inch or two (3–5 cm) uncovered during the boil. Add hops and Whirlfloc® as indicated. My use of melanoidin malt emulates a decoction-style mash.

At the end of the boil, remove kettle from heat, add all of the malt extract, stirring until dissolved. Then cool partial boiled wort to 80–85 °F (27–29 °C), move to bottling bucket and add refrigerated water to 6-gallon mark (23-L). Allow to rest for one hour, with the bottling bucket tilted so that the spigot side of the bucket is slightly elevated so the trub slides to the opposite side of the bucket. After an hour, open spigot of the bottling bucket, capture the first pint of wort before allowing the rest of the wort to flow into your fermenter. Add the yeast when filling the fermenter.

Ferment at 62 °F (17 °C) and after 3 days allow to rise to 68 °F (20 °C). Once fermentation is complete, rack beer to a secondary and lager for two months at 32 °F (0 °C). Rack beer, prime, and bottle condition (I would recommend adding fresh yeast), or keg and force carbonate.

Tips for Success:

I have tested my RO water and my tests show it has a pH of 6, so I do not do any adjustments with phosphoric acid to my water. The RO water you use may have a different pH, so it should be checked and brought to 5.5 if it is not already close.
